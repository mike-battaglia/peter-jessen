<p><strong>1 Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a> and Summary: The Two Key Questions 
  of Brotherhood and Neighborliness </strong></p>
<ul>
  <strong>To be self-reliant, people need an asset base.</strong> Without human, financial 
  or physical capital, they cannot prosper. <strong>It starts with education [</strong>knowledge 
  rights<strong>](Chapter 7). It is manifested in housing [ property rights] (Chapter 
  8). It is enabled by jobs [ economic participation rights](Chapter 9). Minneapolis 
  has and continues to systematically deny these to its inner city poor, especially 
  the Black inner city poor [civil rights].&#8212;-"The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes,&#8221; pp. 129-230</strong> 
</ul>
<strong> 
<p>People have asked me to comment on the <strong>Affirmative Action decision</strong> 
  of the Supreme Court regarding the University of Michigan. As I have stated 
  in my book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> there should no longer 
  be a need for Affirmative Action. But, as I also said, because its goals have 
  not yet been met, it must be kept until those goals are in place. Those goals 
  have been blocked and hi-jacked by saboteurs and free-riders, both Black and 
  White. Thus, there is still a need for affirmative action. For the purposes 
  of my discussion, I will refer to it as <strong>Restorative Affirmative Action,</strong> 
  restoring Blacks to full citizenship in reality, not just on paper. A time frame 
  for it will also be suggested. 
<p>My reference for over 40 years has been and remains the inner city. But first, 
  let us put all of this into context. <strong>THE key need is education.</strong> 
  And the dirty little secret is that both parties have colluded, along with self-appointed 
  Black leaders, to make sure inner city Blacks are not educated. The only other 
  conclusion is that Blacks are too dumb to learn (which, as that is empirically 
  not true; leave the collusion reason, where our kids have been subordinated 
  to the ideological/political). <strong>THE key process needed is to find the 
  common ground</strong> all can stand on, and seek a <strong>reconciliation</strong> 
  between races and classes and parties to enable that to happen. 
<p>Simply stated, as expressed in my book and discussed in this paper, the original 
  goal of affirmative action has been changed to exclude, dilute, and/or prevent 
  gains by the American ancestors of American slavery in the areas of education, 
  jobs, and housing. Now it is used to continue the reneging of the promises of 
  the 60s. 
<p><strong>My book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i></strong> is 
  all about the sordid past, the uneasy present, and how to build a satisfactory 
  future for all. In the book I pull the covers off and expose the actions of 
  those who would make the inner cities the last outposts in America where the 
  harmful political and economic machinery for keeping minorities "in their place,&#8221; 
  especially the descendents of America's slaves, are played out in terms of education, 
  jobs, housing, and the war on young Black men. In the book I lay out the problems 
  as I have observed them in over 40 years as a grass roots community activist. 
  I expose and explain and connect the dots between the misguided and elitist 
  views of how America's inner cities are controlled. But I also have a vision 
  of a America as a beacon on a hill for all. I challenge the "Mastuhs&#8221; 
  to include a seat at the table for everyone. <strong> 
<p>To help in the discussion on how to do so I provide four documents. 
<p><strong>FIRST, the base, my book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.</i></strong> 
  In it I accompany my critique and analysis with recommended solutions to consider 
  in the areas of <strong>(1) </strong> education (Chapter 7), <strong>(2)</strong> 
  jobs (Chapter 9), <strong>(3)</strong> housing (Chapter 8), <strong>(4)</strong> 
  public safety (Chapter 16), <strong>(5)</strong> safe environment (Chapter 8), 
  <strong>(6)</strong> governing, including citizen participation (Chapters 10-15), 
  and <strong>(7)</strong> ethics (Chapter 5, 17, Conclusion). There are also 
  chapters on my own biographical background (Chapters 1-4), philosophical stance 
  (Chapters 5-6) and my solutions (Chapters 5, 17, Conclusion). In between each 
  chapter is an "Interlude&#8221; related to the historic moments in our history 
  (Minneapolis Star Tribune report on racism, good and bad; taking of Black wealth 
  and land; gerrymandering; The Tulsa Race Riots; slave stories and slave ancestry, 
  lynchings and assassinations), historic figures (Nellie Stone Johnson, Washington-Lincoln-Jefferson 
  and Carver-DuBois-King, Jr./Marshall, Pullman Porters and A. Philip Randolph; 
  Adam Clayton Powell), and a calculus of meaning and pain for analyzing actions 
  and laws. The book is available through these online book stores, www.amazon.com, 
  www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, and www.BeaconOnTheHill.com Press. 
<p><strong>SECOND,</strong> as "The Minneapolis Story Continues,&#8221; <strong>the 
  seven keys/themes/solutions paper</strong> has recommendations organized around 
  the seven areas noted above, and expanded on, in my paper <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html">Seven 
  Solutions</a> in the "Solution Papers&#8221; section of my web page, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. 
<p>THIRD, as it is the major policy piece in America that effects us the most, 
  I am providing this paper, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/restore.html">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a>. </strong>
<p><strong><strong>FOURTH,</strong> within a month <strong>"The Minneapolis Story 
  Continues&#8221;</strong> will be available. It will be a compilation of the 
  Solution Papers, weekly newspaper columns, and daily web log as they appear 
  currently on line at www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. It will be available through 
  these online stores: <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon 
  Books online</a>, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com">The Minneapolis 
  Story web page</a></strong>, and the web page of our publisher, <a href="http://www.BeaconOnTheHill.com">Beacon 
  On The Hill Press</a>. 
<p>There are two questions that are the backdrop of this discussion that are at 
  the heart and core of <strong>the DUTIES of the Sons of Abraham, The Peoples 
  of the Book: Jews, Christians, and Moslems. </strong> The first question, asked 
  in the Old Testament is "Am I my brother's keeper?&#8221; The second question, 
  asked in the New Testament, is "who is my neighbor?&#8221; The Peoples of the 
  Book subscribe to or accept this Bible, which makes clear that we are our brothers' 
  keepers and everyone is our neighbor. 
<p>The major sources of the answer have been the Bible and Darwin. Conservatives 
  and liberals conclude America's descendents of slaves are unlike others, always 
  have been, and therefore can't make it on their own and require living on government 
  inner city plantations (the 1968 Kerner Commission Report and the 1998 Bell 
  Curve). Despite these roadblocks, the descendents of America's slaves continue 
  to "escape.&#8221; But too many are still "kept in their place.&#8221; My book, 
  this paper on Restorative Affirmative Action and my 7 Solutions piece are all 
  about how to repudiate this policy, reconcile the races, redevelop the inner 
  cities, provide equal access, equal opportunity, fairness and justice for all, 
  so that all may sit at society's table. The book's solution recommendations 
  are summarized in Chapter 7. 
<p><strong>The Freedom's Arc for the descendents of America's slaves has been 
  as consistent as it has been short and as perseveringly fought for.</strong> 
  Technically speaking, Blacks have only had full freedom in this country between 
  1864 and 1976, 12 years, and from 1964 to 1968, 4 years, for a total of 16 years. 
  Remember: "technically speaking.&#8221; Our people did not come over on tour 
  boats nor were they welcomed on "y'all come&#8221; immigrant waves. They were 
  forcibly brought, many dying on the middle pages between the shores, and kept 
  uneducated, poorly housed, and working at the bottom of the job pool. <strong>Relatively 
speaking, <strong>these are the same conditions we fight today in our inner cities, 
the last outpost of those running our inner city Plantations: the least educated 
(Chapter 7), the poorest housing (Chapter 8), and the worst jobs (Chapter 9), 
along with the highest unemployment compared to other groups.</strong> 
<p>After being liberated as a result of the civil war, the Democrats in the South 
  traded our freedom to the Republicans for the Presidency in a deal cut in the 
  House of Representatives, as there was no winner in the electoral college. In 
  exchange, the Republicans, the abolitionist party, withdrew Federal troops from 
  the South ending Reconstruction. The Southern Democrats then instituted the 
  Klan and Jim Crow laws. 
<p>The Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, but it too became too much for both 
  parties. When the Kerner Commission Report said in 1968 we were not like others 
  and couldn't make it on our own, the permanent herding into the city plantations 
  was established. This was &#8220;confirmed&#8221; as the right thing to do by 
  the 1998 book, <i>The Bell Curve,</i>, that concluded we were too dumb to make 
  it on our own. Despite these, many of us have flourished and escaped those confines, 
  disproving their truth while the Democrats and Republicans persist in continuing 
  this junk science. My story, the Minneapolis Story, is about those still held 
  back, but still trying, but hobbled by laws, policies, and practices that keep 
  inner city youth uneducated and thus unable to escape, putting as many in jail 
  as possible. 
<p><i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> is about my struggles against 
  that and against the Black organizations that have sold out for their own benefit 
  to this ongoing inner city extension of the White man's plantation. The book 
  may be ordered from these online book stores: www.amazon.com, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, 
  and www.BeaconOnTheHill.com Press. 
<p>There are many helps leading to how to answer the questions, "Am I my brother's 
  keeper?&#8221; and "Who is my neighbor?&#8221; A favorite from the Old Testament 
  is Micah 6:8: "&#8230;do justice, and love kindness and walk humbly&#8230;&#8221; 
  The best answers from the New Testament are the parable of the Good Samaritan 
  and the Maundy Thursday exhortation to "love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; 
  and to "serve one another.&#8221; That is it. Sum and substance. 
<p>How? By following <strong>the golden rule</strong> (which is at the heart of 
  most the world's religions and some secular philosophies: treating others as 
  you would like to be treated). Too often, this rule has been bent to say that 
  he who has the gold rules. The need is not to persuade "the other&#8221; that 
  they are wrong, to educate them, suggesting a superior position that has to 
  be acknowledged by the inferior, as people act intentionally and have a right 
  to their own opinion (this was the dooming seed of its own self destruction 
  of bussing: Blacks couldn&#8217;t learn unless sitting next to Whites). The 
  need, therefore, is to find, despite disagreements, the <strong>common ground</strong> 
  on which to stand despite differences of opinion: a common set of <strong>YESes</strong> 
  commonly desired and a common set of <strong>NOs</strong> commonly not desired 
  (Chapter 5 of my book). This can be done despite there being differences of 
  opinion on how to achieve the YESes and prevent the NOs. All it requires is 
  <strong>ubuntu, or reconciliation</strong> of the races. 
<p>But first, lets reflect on some reminders about what we are all about: 
<ul>
  For every one of us that succeeds, it's because there's somebody there to show 
  you the way out. The light doesn't necessarily have to be in your family; for 
  me it was teachers and school. &#8212;Oprah Winfrey 
  <p>I know why the caged bird sings&#8230;I note the obvious differences between 
    each sort and type, but <strong>we are more a like, my friends, than we are 
    unalike</strong>&#8230;We allow our ignorance to prevail upon us and make 
    us think we can survive alone, alone in patches, alone in races, even alone 
    in genders.&#8221; &#8212;Maya Angelou 
  <p>I am proposing, therefore, that, just as we granted a GI Bill of Rights to 
    war veterans, America launch a broad-based and gigantic <strong>Bill of Rights 
    for the Disadvantaged,</strong> our veterans of the long siege of denial&#8230;While 
    <strong>Negroes </strong>form [a part of] America&#8217;s disadvantaged, there 
    are <strong>[more] millions of white poor</strong> who would <strong>also 
    benefit</strong> from such a bill &#8212;Martin Luther King, Jr., &#8220;Why 
    We Can&#8217;t Wait,&#8221; pages 137-138 
  <p>Siya hamb' ekukha nyen' kwen khos We are marching in the light of God. &#8212;South 
    African Hymn 
  <p>&#8220;No man is a good citizen unless he so acts as to show that he actually 
    uses the Ten Commandments, and translates the Golden Rule into his life conduct. 
    &#8212;Theodore Roosevelt 
  <p>As a result of the past [apartheid in South Africa], they have a lot of catching 
    up to do in terms of education, training, learning, and how to function in 
    a modern society as a whole, and as part of the majority. &#8212;Michael Cassidy 
    (quoted on p. 125) 
  <p>How can a people incapable of self-government in their private lives succeed 
    in practicing self-government in their public lives?&#8212;Michael Novak 
  <p>&#8220;Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but 
    the right answer.&#8221;&#8212;John F. Kennedy 
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that neither the books nor the two papers are about 
  complaints and whining: they are about facts and proposed actions. They are 
  about being positive and providing optimism and hope and recipes for success 
  in the inner city. I have long believed that one should not critique unless 
  one has an alternative solution to propose. Thus, in addition to the summary 
  of my solutions in Chapter 17 of my book, I have also posted my papers <strong> 
  "7 Solutions,&#8221; </strong> and <strong> Restorative Affirmative Action </strong>in 
  the Solution Papers section of my web site. Full title of the former: "7 Key 
  Themes, 7 Key Problems, And 7 Key Solutions For Solving The Problems Of America&#8217;s 
  Inner Cities In Order To Stop Deferring The Dream And To Actualize It.&#8221; 
  Why is there still a concentration of poor Blacks in the inner city? Because 
  the left and the right share the idea of Black inferiority. 
<p><i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,/i with its suggested solutions, 
  was given to the Minneapolis Mayor in person, and, to the Council Members, most 
  by mail (see <strong>Letter to the Mayor and City Council</strong>) in the "Solution 
  Papers&#8221; section of my web site. Most of the City Council members returned 
  them on the basis that they could not accept gifts. Clearly, from the letter, 
  they were intended as help, not gifts. This is the level of acceptance of thinking 
  under the box (let alone inside or outside the box) in Minneapolis and why Jerry 
  Brown, as discussed below, is correct when he says we have to <strong>fight 
  "the hegemony of the status quo,&#8221; </strong> and <strong> "speak truth 
  to power.&#8221; </strong> </i><i> 
<p>This paper about affirmative action, which I call <strong> "Restorative<a name="Restorative"></a> 
  Affirmative Action,&#8221; </strong> joins my web page as an extension of my 
  book, <strong><i><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com" target="_blank">The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</a>,</i></strong> as part of "The Minneapolis 
  Story Continued.&#8221; It shows how all can have equal access and equal opportunity 
  at success while still being one's brother's keeper, while still being a good 
  neighbor. And even though much of the book is Minneapolis specific, it all applies, 
  across the board, to every city in America with an inner city population of 
  minorities, especially Black Americans descended from slaves. 
<p>In this paper, a continuation of The Minneapolis Story and a continuation of 
  the story of all inner cities in America (for background see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/whistle.htm" target="_blank">The 
  Whistle Blower of Minneapolis</a>, a <strong><i>City Pages</i></strong> cover 
  story about the book or <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/pages/ronrocks.htm" target="_blank">Ron 
  Rocks The Boat Again</a> cover story in <strong><i>The Minneapolis Spokesman-Recorder.</i></strong> 
  the Solution Papers section of my web page). In this "continuation&#8221; of 
  the Minneapolis Story, I discuss the three dirty little secrets (education, 
  middle class or above status, and the collusion between White Democrats and 
  Black leaders to keep Blacks uneducated and dependent), as Brown v. Board of 
  Education is put into perspective. 
<p>Next up is my discussion on the fog involved in the side discussions of diversity 
  (code for affirmative action), abortion and homosexuality, when the culture 
  and its establishment have already spoken on them (melding positions that use 
  parts of both opposing sides). This is followed by the heart of my argument: 
  that restorative affirmative action is still needed but won't be met until the 
  free riders that undermine our efforts are separated from it, which includes 
  the discussion of mixed races over Blacks (the "Tiger<a name="Tiger"></a> Woods 
  Rule&#8221;), the displacement of Blacks by the illegal aliens of "open borders,&#8221; 
  who are given a pass to the front to the line, leaving cities as Southern Plantations<a name="Plantations"></a> 
  (both north and south of the Mason Dixon line). Hence, until these issues are 
  resolved, the Supreme Court decision won't make much difference<a name="difference"></a>. 
  Needed is a return to the understanding of Martin Luther King, Jr. and a change 
  in the direction of the NAACP or else we will head back to "separate but equal&#8221; 
  discrimination. I then discuss the difference between restorative affirmative 
  action and college affirmative action for college bands, newspapers and sports. 
  Thus the central key ideas of restorative affirmative action are redress through 
  restoration, not diversity or multiculturalism that hijack the restorative goal 
  of affirmative action. In this way, we change the focus to the prize, not the 
  prize keepers, as we address four wars on four fronts: the war on poverty and 
  access/opportunity, the war on drugs, the war on terrorism, and, to use the 
  title of the new book by Edwin Black, to end <i>The War on the Weak,</i> to 
  make sure we do not resurrect the past, as in another book title: <i>America's 
  Crusade to Create a Master Race. </i> Our country's mission: E pluribus Unum: 
  out of many: one, and thus: Freedom, Liberty, Prosperity and Justice for all. 
</p>
</i></strong><i> <strong> 
<p>Throughout this paper I will refer to two books, the 1968 <i>Kerner Commission 
  Report</i> and the 1998 <i>Bell Curve,</i> the first a document by liberals 
  and the second a document by conservatives. Each is a great piece of work. But 
  their influence comes from very small sections of each. The first step to making 
  Restorative Affirmative Action work is to repudiate their destructive errors, 
  which, although taking up a small part of either, have packed the biggest wallop 
  to enabling continuing the spirit of Jim Crow, especially in the inner cities. 
<p><i>The Kerner Commission Report,</i> concludes that the solution for Blacks 
  is to make them wards of the state as they are unlike other people and thus 
  can't make it on their own like all other immigrants. This mars an otherwise 
  wonderful work. Indeed, its suggested solutions, which I list in my book, are 
  sabotaged and short circuited by the statement that the ancestors of slaves 
  can't make it. But it serves its purpose: providing a &#8220;plausible&#8221; 
  reason for keeping the ancestors of slaves in their place. 
<p>In <i>The Bell Curve,</i> it is a small chapter that attempts to demonstrate 
  that Blacks are the dumbest of the dumb, as it ranks a "smart&#8221; hierarchy 
  rating Orientals first, then Whites, then Browns, then Blacks. It concludes 
  that the solution is to make Blacks the wards of the state. This is racist. 
  This is stupid. Thus, in a few pages, a book is undermined and denigrated, even 
  though it is otherwise a first rate book on intelligence. But it serves its 
  purpose: providing a &#8220;plausible&#8221; reason for keeping the ancestors 
  of slaves in their place. 
<p> Mickey Kaus once described those liberals who simply assume the permanent 
  neediness of minorities as <strong>&#8220;Bell Curve Liberals&#8221;:</strong> 
<p> 
<ul>
  &#8230;people who would never admit it but have internalized the notion that 
  minorities are simply dumber than the majority. They either believe that such 
  inferiority is in part genetic and in part environmental or entirely environmental. 
  But the upshot is always the same: these people are helpless; and all we can 
  do is rig the system to disguise it as much as possible and minimize social 
  resentment and division. 
</ul>
<p>This is why until both liberals and conservatives repudiate this nonsense, 
  Democrats will continue to conspire against Blacks behind their backs and why 
  Republicans will sit back and let them. My goal is to expose this falsehood 
  and the fact that this is the public policy foundation, and so help us to move 
  forward to integration of all peoples as Americans with equal access and equal 
  opportunity to succeed or fail. Until this repudiation takes place, it will 
  remain a recycling of the "same &#8216;ol same &#8216;ol.&#8221; 
<p><strong> 2. The Three Dirty Little Secrets<a name="Secrets"></a> </strong> 
<p><strong>The first "dirty little secret&#8221;</strong> is well known: middleclass 
  and above parents can afford housing in neighborhoods/suburbs with good schools 
  and have accumulated wealth and/or incomes that can ensure that their kids make 
  it through college if that is what they want to do, and thus have the opportunity 
  for a good start up the ladder of social mobility. Let's repeat Nellie Stone 
  Johnson: <strong>"no education no jobs no housing&#8221;</strong> and <strong>"no 
  education no jobs no hope.&#8221;</strong> See Interlude 3 of my book. 
<p><strong>The second dirty little secret,</strong> also actually well known, 
  is that the education gap between Blacks and Hispanics on one hand and Whites 
  and other Asians (who, depending on their country of origin, fall into one or 
  the other category) continues to widen (see my book, Chapter 7) and thus gets 
  better at helping to keep he descendents of slaves in our place. 
<p><strong>The third dirty little secret</strong> is the collusion between Democrats 
  and Black leaders to continue the vote getting strategies of dependency of inner 
  city Blacks while the Republicans sitting idly by letting them do so in exchange 
  for the suburbs. I cover this in Chapters 7-14, 16. 
<p>In just over a year we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of <i>Brown v. Board 
  of Education</i> (decided May 17, 1954, after being argued December 9, 1952, 
  and reargued December 8, 1953). We've made great progress except in the inner 
  city, the heart of the red states on the political map, due in part to the faulty 
  reasoning behind Brown's good decision (as discussed below in Section 21, "Warning&#8230;&#8221;). 
  The Supreme Court said that decision was aimed at bringing about equal access, 
  equal opportunity (the goal of the "solutions&#8221; in my book) for every American 
  child (not LBJ's "equal results&#8221; but America's promise of equal access, 
  equal opportunity) and, by admission, NOT for adults in housing and jobs. Now, 
  in 2003, the Supreme Court says, after their decision regarding the University 
  of Michigan college and its law school (<i>Grutter vs. Bollinger, et al, </i> 
  argued April 1, 2003 and decided June 23, 2003, and <i>Gratz et al vs. Bollinger, 
  et al, </i> argued April 1, 2003 and decided June 23, 2003), (in the words of 
  Justice O'Connor) that it will take another 25 years to get to where we don't 
  need affirmative action. However, if we continue as we have been, nothing will 
  change, another 25 years will be called for, etc., as the situation continues 
  in perpetuity. 
<p>I agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the thoughts of his book entitled 
  <i><strong>Why We Can't Wait</strong></i> (See <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/dream.html">Unfinished 
  Dream </a>in the Solution Papers section of my web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com). 
  Sadly, our self-appointed local leaders have advocated that it is &#8220;us&#8221; 
  that is the problem and that it will take generations, teaching helplessness 
  and hopelessness rather that the optimism and hope I call for in my book. Rather 
  than marching on corporations our so-called Black spokesmen and women should 
  be marching in protest against those who control what is being done to inner 
  city Black youth (see pages 154-156 of my book), including the schools. Instead, 
  "sellouts&#8221; (Blacks marching to the tune of their Democratic Party paymasters) 
  help continue that perpetuation. With Blacks like these the Whites don't have 
  to lift a finger to "keep us in our place.&#8221; Our "leaders&#8221; do it 
  for them. Well, that certainly guarantees them jobs. But it won't provide jobs 
  through needed education for the generations of kids forced to live under this 
  jobs program for the "leaders&#8221; as it creates a sense of helplessness and 
  hopelessness and future joblessness in the minds of too many of our inner city 
  kids. 
<p>In selling out to the teachers unions for their votes in elections, Democrats, 
  Black and White, have sold out inner city kids. The great irony of inner city 
  education is that it is controlled by Democrats who, while condemning President 
  Bush's "Leave No Child Behind&#8221; program have spent the past two decades, 
  if not longer, leaving Black children behind. What we lost in Martin Luther 
  King was his ability to preach the uniquely American integration of Enlightenment 
  rationality (the good half of the secular left) with Christian realism (the 
  understanding that human beings are not perfect or perfectible but can change 
  and have good impulses, the good half of the religious right). 
<p>This is also seen in <strong>the ubuntu theology of reconciliation</strong> 
  espoused and practiced by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa as the way 
  to unite oppressed Blacks and oppressor Whites after apartheid in South Africa 
  (to read more see my web site blog entries #163, 164, and 172. <strong>Bottom 
  line:</strong> Solve the education question and you solve most other issues 
  between the races and <strong>restore</strong> Blacks to the mainstream and 
  finally sit all of us at the table. As former California Governor Jerry Brown 
  said about the California recall election, it is time <strong>to fight "the 
  hegemony of the status quo,&#8221; to "speak truth to power.&#8221;</strong> 
  This is what I have done in my book, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, 
  where I have pulled the covers off and exposed the actions of the powerful people 
  and institutions determined to take their misguided and elitist views of how 
  to control a city to the rest of America. As with my web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, 
  this essay, "Restorative Affirmative Action,&#8221; is part of <i>The Minneapolis 
  Story Continues.</i> 
<p> <strong>3. The Question Remains: Can We Find Common<a name="Common"></a> Ground? 
  The People of California Have Not Only Said Yes But Are Showing How. <i>The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</i> Also Outlines How To Do So </strong> 
<p> The California election produced a socially liberal, pro-choice, pro-affirmative 
  action, pro-environment fiscal conservative Republican (tough on taxes and spending 
  and on excessive government power) who accepts gays and medical if not recreational 
  marihuana,and a hawk on security regarding foreign policy. This, it seems to 
  me, will be viewed as not only an historic recall election but a vote bringing 
  welcome seismic tremors to the cultural and political status quo, threatening 
  "the hegemony of the status quo&#8221; and "speaking truth to power,&#8221; 
  and, if we are lucky, help bring both the left and right closer to the center 
  where it is easier to find common ground. My concerns regarding inner cities 
  are the results of people fighting not for people or for kids but for ideas 
  staked out either to the far left or far right. In this clash, inner city Blacks, 
  especially school kids, get squeezed in the middle. Missing until October 7, 
  2003, was a credible view of and chance for a middle ground all could stand 
  on. 
<p>With 23% of the Black vote and 50% of the Hispanic vote and 57% of the woman's 
  vote and 50% of the union vote and 40% of the gay vote, and 62% of the total 
  vote going to the two Republicans in the California recall, ideology was replaced 
  with a sense of reality driven by a desire for practicality, that to succeed 
  California had to find a common ground. The so-called base of the Democratic 
  Party has obviously departed the common sense message of JFK: to spur economic 
  growth and create jobs taxes must be cut. How can this be done when Sacramento 
  increased spending 40% over four years and added 44,000 employees to the government 
  payroll despite a hiring freeze, as well as creating other rules and regulations 
  and levees on both employers and employees, creating a $38 billion deficit and 
  other consequences resulting in tens of thousands leaving the state? Having 
  worked in California on several Presidential campaigns, including that of Hubert 
  Humphrey, I am familiar with its make up. You can image my shock to see in this 
  recall election that three of the richest areas went to Davis by 63% (San Mateo 
  County), 68% (Marin County) and 80% (San Francisco), whereas three of the poorer 
  counties went to Schwarzenegger, with the percentages 64% (Merced County), 72% 
  (Tulare County), and 75% (Lassen County). These voting results suggest that 
  the Democrats, as I have outlined in my book, have lost their ability to represent 
  ordinary people. As my book makes clear, Democrats do not represent Blacks in 
  the inner cities. Rather, they treat the not rich and minorities as if they 
  are workers on a plantation to be domesticated. The Democratic Party has to 
  ask itself this question: was the Davis administration what a liberal Congress 
  and Presidency would look like and govern? If not, what will it do to repudiate 
  what is wrong with that picture and uphold what is right? 
<p>Add the huge vote for Governor elect Schwarzenegger by Evangelical Christians 
  and his bringing San Francisco Democratic Mayor Willie Brown onto his team, 
  as well as 1988 Michael Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich, and the sea 
  change of this is seen all the more. If this can be extended to the inner cities, 
  we will solve the problems long left unchanged by the two major political parties 
  for half a century. I, for one, wish him well. I'll know how successful he is 
  being by how he addresses the problems of the inner city. I'll be particularly 
  keeping my eye on Watts. And if the Democrats try to do to him what the Republicans 
  tried from day one to Bill Clinton and, tit for tat, the Democrats have tried 
  to do to George W. Bush from day one, bring him down and not cooperate, we may 
  well see those percentages above for Blacks, Hispanics and women increase across 
  the country. But if the Democrats will work with the Republicans, then we will 
  have a chance for a healthy two party system again that we can all respect and 
  wish well. I wish that for all of us. He has a muscular mandate. May he flex 
  it well. 
<p>For those who don't like the recall idea, and I'm one, I still have to remind 
  us of the last three words of the Constitution's tenth amendment: "The <strong>powers</strong> 
  not <strong>delegated</strong> to the <strong>United States</strong> by the 
  Constitution, nor prohibited by it to <strong>the States,</strong> are reserved 
  to the States respectively, <strong>or to the people.&#8221; </strong> 
<p><strong>4. First step in racial reconciliation<a name="reconciliation"></a>: 
  Repudiate Destructive Errors of 1968 Kerner Commission Report and 1998 Bell 
  Curve.</strong> 
<p>Throughout this paper I will refer to two documents, the 1968 <i>Kerner Commission 
  Report</i> and the 1998 book, <i>The Bell Curve,</i> the first a document by 
  liberals and the second a document by conservatives. Each is a great piece of 
  work. But their influence comes from very small sections of each. <strong>The 
  first step to making Restorative Affirmative Action work is to repudiate their 
  destructive errors,</strong> which, although taking up a small part of either, 
  have helped to legitimize continuing the spirit of Jim Crow, especially in the 
  inner cities. It is important to repeat what was said earlier, as many just 
  can't connect the dots on this, and thus don't get it. 
<p>In <i>The Bell Curve,</i> it is a small chapter that attempts to demonstrate 
  that Blacks are the dumbest of the dumb, as it ranks a "smart&#8221; hierarchy 
  rating Orientals first, then Whites, then Browns, then Blacks. It concludes 
  that the solution is to make Blacks the wards of the state. This is racist. 
  This is stupid. This, in a few pages, undermines and denigrates what is otherwise 
  a first rate book on intelligence. 
<p>In <i>The Kerner Commission Report,</i> it too concludes that the solution 
  for Blacks is to become wards of the state as they are unlike other people and 
  thus can' make it on their own like all other immigrants. This mars an otherwise 
  wonderful work. Indeed, its suggested solutions, which I list in my book, are 
  sabotaged and short circuited by the statement that we can't make it. 
<p>This is how it is that, as noted above, Mickey Kaus described those liberals 
  who simply assume the permanent neediness of minorities as <strong>&#8220;Bell 
  Curve Liberals&#8221;:</strong> 
<p> 
<ul>
  &#8230;people who would never admit it but have internalized the notion that 
  minorities are simply dumber than the majority. They either believe that such 
  inferiority is in part genetic and in part environmental or entirely environmental. 
  But the upshot is always the same: these people are helpless; and all we can 
  do is rig the system to disguise it as much as possible and minimize social 
  resentment and division. 
</ul>
<p>This is why until both liberals and conservatives repudiate this nonsense, 
  Democrats will continue to conspire against Blacks behind their backs and why 
  Republicans will sit back and let them. My goal is to expose this falsehood 
  and the fact that this is the public policy foundation, in order to move us 
  forward to integration of all peoples as American with equal access and equal 
  opportunity to succeed or fail. Until this repudiation takes place, it will 
  remain a recycling of the "same ol same 'ol.&#8221; 
<p><strong>5. The Establishment<a name="Establishment"></a> Has Spoken! So Let 
  Us First Check The Culture's Temperature On Affirmative Action, Abortion Rights, 
  And Gay Rights. They Have Moved To The Center. Both The Far Left And Far Right 
  Need To Move There Too.</strong> 
<p>Liberty and justice at the macro level and personal life and personal property 
  at the micro level are not to be taken nor treated lightly. Too often the debate 
  by both the political/religious left and right have been based in unwarranted 
  fear; baseless panic; and fundamentalist fervor (both those on the left and 
  the right need look at the Middle East to see the future for fundamentalist 
  frenzies, whether religious or political, frenzies which not only tolerate no 
  other way, but usually sees the existence of "others&#8221; as a call (divine 
  or ideological) to eliminate the demonic "Great Satan&#8221; other. This is 
  not the spirit of reconciliation. 
<p>My brothers and sisters on the extremes will not like this statement, but facts 
  rarely interfered with the thinking of the far left or far right any way: but 
  clearly, America has spoken on several sets of rights, including affirmative 
  action rights, abortion rights, and gay rights. 
<p>This reflects the reality that most Americans reject ethnic or racial identification 
  as a meaningful barometer of who they are. 
<p>In terms of the Supreme Court (and the general population) we can say this: 
  <strong>the establishment has spoken favorably for affirmative action</strong> 
  in the U.S.A., left and right, private and public sectors, liberals and conservatives, 
  established businessmen and entrepreneurs, and the military and academe, have 
  spoken: don't kill it. Keep it in some fashion as long as it is for fairness 
  and not for quotas. The debates will continue, but affirmative action is here 
  to stay for at least another 25 years. And if we make it <strong>restorative</strong> 
  affirmative action, we can indeed end it in 25 years. How well we deal with 
  it will determine whether it should continue. I fervently hope there will be 
  no need. But restorative affirmative action is not based on the ideological 
  notions of multiculturalism or diversity as narrowly understood but rather on 
  the basis of fairness and a recognition that fairness still needs a boost (as 
  opposed to having a quota based racial caste system, which would mold us in 
  the image of the old American South as well as South Africa when it was an anti-liberty 
  apartheid state). Most Americans accept multiculturalism as long as it is subordinated 
  to the culture of America which values the culture of liberty, and accepts diversity 
  not as a magic potion but as a part of fairness as long as it is subordinated 
  to merit and the unique worth of each individual. Not that there can't be problems, 
  which I discuss in the "Warning&#8221; and "Repeal&#8221; sections at the end 
  of this paper. 
<p>The one diversity issue that still rages, although I believe Americans will 
  also speak to it soon, is the allowance of religion in the public square. Despites 
  the qualms (to put it kindly) of the left and right, America will affirm freedom 
  of religion <strong>and</strong> separation of church and state but not allow 
  separation of religion and state, as that goes against the liberty of personal 
  conscience and would, taken to its extreme, outlaw any who prayed, and prevent 
  any who believed in any religion from holding office, which is the goal of the 
  fundamentalists on the left who are atheists and who conveniently stress the 
  first half of the first amendment and ignore the second half (''Congress shall 
  make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
  exercise thereof&#8221;), and thus deny any official governmental role of any 
  believer of any kind. As I write in my book (Chapters 1, 2, 5 and Interlude 
  4), Gunner Myra calls America's culture of liberty "the American creed,&#8221; 
  and although he wrote on race relations it applies to all other areas of interaction 
  and relations as well. America, as opposed to other countries, stands for individual 
  liberty, and what I call <strong>"Restorative</strong> Affirmative action.&#8221; 
  It is to promote universal individual liberty, regardless of race/creed/color/sexual 
  orientation/gender, not group goals or Byzantine balkanization based on the 
  particularities of color or race or creed or sexual orientation or gender. 
<p><strong>The establishment has also spoken favorably regarding abortion.</strong> 
  Most Americans accept abortions in the first trimester, are split regarding 
  the 2nd trimester, and come together in agreement that it should be rare for 
  the 3rd trimester, with most opposed to so-called late term/partial birth abortion, 
  a once useful but sad end to babies born without brains or spines, but now sought 
  as an elective by late term decisions, making it more akin to infanticide. The 
  debates will continue regarding trimesters but abortion itself is here to stay. 
  Roe vs. Wade will not be reversed (although the hysterics from both the left 
  and right still use the issue to help them raise contributions as they raise 
  the other side as a fear factor). 
<p><strong>And the establishment has spoken affirmatively about homosexuality 
  and gay rights.</strong> In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed 
  homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Standard Manual of Mental Disorders. The 
  debates will continue over what coupling means, from civil unions to marriage, 
  but there will be no reversals regarding their civil rights. 
<p><strong>Affirmative Action has not yet been implemented for its intended purpose.</strong> 
  Its goal, <strong>restoration,</strong> was to help Blacks make up for forced 
  lost time (slavery, Jim Crow, and being "cornered&#8221; since 1968 (Kerner 
  Commission Report that said Blacks are different and not like others so they 
  have to be cared for by the state, thus spawning a huge White bureaucratic jobs 
  program for White democrats "to service and care for&#8221; Blacks in the inner 
  cities. Thus the need for <strong>Restorative Affirmative Action</strong> is 
  still a valid need, especially for those in the inner cities who are still being 
  forced to lose time, as well as those in the middle class who have "escaped&#8221; 
  but haven't built up asset legacies to the extent Whites have, with much of 
  what they should have having been taken from them (see my Interlude 8 of my 
  book, "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes&#8221;). 
<p>In other words, we still need to fulfill the historic goal of affirmative action: 
  <strong>to redress the drag placed on the advancement of Blacks</strong> by 
  250 years of slavery, 75 years of Jim Crow, and 35 years of the liberal 1968 
  Kerner Commission Report's two nation wrong-headedness declaring Blacks can't 
  make it on their own without government help as they are not like other people 
  (which was supported by the conservative 1998 book The Bell Curve which stated 
  Blacks can't make it because we are too dumb. We Black Americans who are African-American 
  and descended from slaves need <strong>Restorative Affirmative action.</strong> 
<p>This article also builds on the affirmative action paragraph of my February 
  2003 <a href="06voting.htm"> At-Large Voting: Another Way to Disenfranchise 
  Minority Voters </a>, which appears in the Solution Papers&#8221; section of 
  my web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com: 
<p> 
<ul>
  Affirmative Action is not &#8220;doing to others what you want everyone to do 
  unto everybody else.&#8221; It insists that minorities (now defined to include 
  far more than the ancestors of slaves, such as women, gays, people with physical 
  disabilities) cannot and will not survive unless the system is tilted in their 
  favor. In other words, we are inferior. That is racist. This goes against the 
  grain of what Martin Luther King, Jr. called the difference between being unqualified 
  (receiving a purposefully poor education) and being qualifiable (what will happen 
  if education for Blacks is as good and well funded as education for Whites). 
  Affirmative Action enriches the special interests that &#8220;market&#8221; 
  and administer it so they can obtain the funding that comes with doing so (either 
  in the form of government programs or in bureaucratic positions mandated for 
  the overseeing of it in both corporate, government, and educational settings). 
  Now women, gays, the physically challenged, and other self-described victim 
  groups, who never suffered slavery and who are not colored, have completely 
  muddied the waters (pun intended). Why? To give the Democrats more voting blocs. 
  They get the votes. Program administrators get jobs. And Blacks, especially 
  in the inner cities, get very little. 
</ul>
<p>The key to upward mobility in modern society is education. One of the greatest 
  social inventions of modern times is the American public school system in general 
  and the vast public university systems in particular. But to take advantage 
  of the latter you need to succeed in the former. To keep us Blacks in our place, 
  Whites have created a less than 3rd rate system for inner city Blacks in the 
  public schools (see Chapter 7, on Education, of my book, "The Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes&#8221;), making it more difficult to get into college. And, 
  as many get in through affirmative action, they are sabotaged, as affirmative 
  action skews Blacks to colleges above their grade and SAT ranges. Where they 
  match, Blacks do as well if not better. Affirmative action, by moving everyone 
  up a notch out of their level, insures the best don't do well. Unless the public 
  K-12 system is fixed, we'll never make it in sufficient numbers to college. 
  Indeed, in many states <strong>there are more young Blacks in jail than in college.</strong> 
  That must change. If this was the case with Whites, the change would be made 
  to happen over night (see pp. 154-156 of my book). 
<p>Therefore, let's call it what it should be called, <strong>"Restorative Affirmative 
  Action,&#8221;</strong> in order to distinguish its historic mission for Blacks 
  and thus separate it from the revisionism of those current groups using it today, 
  groups that I call saboteurs or free riders, and to remind us it is <strong>to 
  restore and move on, not to be forever.</strong> Affirmative Action has once 
  again turned Blacks into beasts of burden, as it creates free riders who ride 
  on the backs of Blacks. These free riders and saboteurs include several types 
  of groups: <strong> (1)</strong> White middle class professional workers (planners, 
  agencies at all levels, so-called educators, social workers, health professionals, 
  therapists, etc.), <strong>(2)</strong> non-profits, and other "well intentioned&#8221; 
  groups manipulating Blacks for their own benefit, <strong>(3)</strong> self-appointed 
  "spokes groups such as the NAACP staffers, organizations run by or affiliated 
  with both nationally known as well as locally known Black preachers and churches, 
  etc., that say it will take generations to right the wrongs and thus they need 
  to be paid to keep Blacks under control and in line, as well as <strong>(4)</strong> 
  such professional victim/identity groups as feminists, White GLBT, physically 
  and mentally disabled, ethnics (Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans), religions 
  (Islam, Buddhists, etc.), atheists, and newly arrived immigrant groups (legal 
  and illegal), among others. 
<p>These later groups are free riders who need to be stopped from taking the benefits 
  meant for Blacks for themselves. Let us give these other groups their own versions 
  of "affirmative action&#8221; if need be, but group by group, if there is a 
  case for it. For Blacks the term has been shown, in our current context, to 
  be meaningless. We need to use a better goal oriented term. I nominate: <strong>"Restorative</strong> 
  Affirmative Action. The "unfinished business&#8221; of obtaining freedom for 
  everyone, as Frederic Douglass expressed it, remains unfinished. Now clearly 
  we all sign on to the notion that no one should denigrate another&#8217;s race, 
  religion, national origin or sexual orientation. But too often this is turned 
  around as if any of these are also victim groups with their different voices 
  and different issues, as partners with the descendants of slaves, and thus claim 
  the need of civil rights protections, diluting the rightful claim of Blacks. 
  Simply stated, those descended from slaves have a different claim than those 
  of other groups. The others are free riders. 
<p>The latest groups of free riders are illegal immigrants (newly sworn in citizens 
  are not free riders). Look what is going on in California: illegal aliens are 
  allowed to obtain California driver's licenses (as this is the foundation of 
  all means of legal ID in this country, we should see every riff raff and criminals 
  wanting "legal ID&#8221; go to California to do so; the ability of terrorists 
  to get legal ID in California will greatly complicate Homeland security, calling 
  for greater police powers, not less in order to deal with them). Also, illegal 
  aliens are allowed to not only attend California colleges but do so without 
  out of state tuition charged to them, putting them ahead of the line of all 
  other non-California U.S. citizens. So does it make a difference anymore in 
  California whether you break the law to get there as you can drive, send your 
  kids to college and get on public assistance? This is a recipe for an even greater 
  budget deficit than they now have, a recipe for greater taxes, and more companies 
  and people leaving the state, a reverse exodus already done by tens of thousands. 
  From my perspective as a Black man, however, the key problems with this is that 
  it is one more deferring of the restoration still owed the descendents of American 
  slaves. 
<p>The newest wrinkle are the "immigrants' freedom rides&#8221; to secure amnesty 
  for the illegals. First of all, this demeans and desecrates the Civil Rights 
  Freedom Rides of the 1950s and trivializes them. Secondly, granting blanket 
  amnesty to 8 million illegal immigrants will be the greatest group of "free 
  riders&#8221; ever. It would be better if democrats gave more thought to immigration 
  amnesty beyond its use to bribe voters. There are no new immigrant waves for 
  them to meet at the dock so they are creating them, at our expense. 
<p>So Blacks, having had to endure slavery then Jim Crow then the good intended 
  but ill conceived and wrongheaded policy suggestions of the 1968 Kerner Commission 
  Report, have seen affirmative action turned into a spoils system for middle 
  class Blacks and for White and Black professionals in the "helping&#8221; and 
  legal and do good professions. I'm not arguing against California's desire to 
  give itself away. I'm just saying it still has an obligation of first priority 
  to those who have legitimate claims: the descendants of slaves. 
<p><strong>6. Free<a name="Free"></a> riders corrupt the political process and 
  undermine liberty </strong> 
<p>The use by the political class to use free riders to usurp government purpose 
  is the danger the Madisonians fought at the Constitutional convention. The Constitution 
  recognizes the shared belief that human beings are not perfect yet neither are 
  they purposeless, as all seek order and meaning, albeit in different ways. The 
  idea was clear: checks and balances by distributing power among the legislative, 
  executive and judicial branches (recall that before it was by the fiat of kings 
  or kings with nobles). The will of the majority was to prevail but not at the 
  expense of minorities -which then meant not ethnic or racial groups, as Blacks 
  were already denied a vote - but those voters whose vote was less than 50% and 
  thus on the losing side of a policy issue debate). The danger has become that 
  <strong>"specific&#8221; rights</strong> have been <strong>elevated</strong> 
  out of the changing realm of policy <strong>to</strong> the unchanging realm 
  of <strong>"protected rights.&#8221;</strong> Every right that is so elevated 
  adds to the centralization of power in the hands of the politicians and the 
  agencies and takes it away from communities and individuals. 
<p>This is what the DFL has wrought in Minneapolis (and the Democratic Party in 
  cities across America). They have turned cities into liberal plantations run 
  by White middle class bureaucrats and so-called self-appointed Black "leaders,&#8221; 
  all in the name of the poor. But to maintain their jobs and plantations and 
  thus power, they must keep as many Blacks poor and disqualified as possible 
  (to make sustaining their positions, and hence personal jobs, plausible). As 
  many Blacks have gotten out despite the roadblocks placed in their paths, they 
  have had to be replaced, just as Tammany Hall did with new immigrants (great 
  scene of this in the movie "Gangs of New York&#8221;). Now the deal is to replace 
  those that get out with free rider replacements such as women, GLBT, disabled, 
  illegal immigrants, etc. The cities are prevented from being incubators of democracy 
  and places for economic wealth building. This merely replicates the slave model 
  of the South, incubating crime from young Black men and a war against them through 
  the "war on drugs&#8221; programs. 
<p>As noted, in the South, for Blacks to learn to read, or for Whites to teach 
  them, was a capital offense. If they could read they could find their way out 
  following road signs. So today, if they can read they can get educated, get 
  qualified, and obtain jobs that would enable them to leave the urban plantation 
  ghetto. This the DFL fights in Minneapolis and the Democrats fight in cities 
  across the country. Again, for details, see Chapter 7 of my book, in which my 
  thesis is: "Poor schools for poor kids to keep them poor,&#8221; that inner 
  city schools (the results of Democratic leadership in education) is little more 
  than "clubbing the cubs into inferiority and helplessness.&#8221; <strong>This 
  is why, in my book, I call for Minneapolis public schools to "stop the clubbing 
  and teach skills, optimism, and hope.&#8221;</strong> 
<p>A parallel case is the war on drugs: if we win it what do all of those government 
  drug war workers do? That is their fear. So, to many of us, this why they work 
  to contain, not end the war on drugs. Indeed, as some have suggested, it was 
  through government agencies that the inner cities were introduced to rock cocaine 
  in the 1980s. It saved their jobs. Harvey Firstein, in the July 30, 2003 New 
  York Times, "The Culture of Disease,&#8221; makes the same parallel case for 
  those fighting AIDS (emphasis added):
<ul>
  Instead, we&#8217;ve sold our next generation into drug slavery and their destiny 
  to medical researchers because we&#8217;d rather treat each other as sexual 
  objects than as family. Thanks to the drug companies that have made billions 
  of dollars off us, and to the medical community that has gained a captive audience 
  to fill appointment books, and to AIDS charities that have become a career for 
  many, we have created an industry of disease that would crumble if AIDS was 
  cured in our community.&#8221; In other words, "H.I.V. is an almost completely 
  avoidable infection. You need to be compliant in some very specific behaviors 
  to be at risk. In fact, if every person now infected vowed that the disease 
  ended with him, we could wipe out the ballooning number of new infections. 
</ul>
<p>Affirmative action was to enable this process of qualifying Blacks so they 
  could make up for what was lost by purposefully run poor public education (especially 
  in the Jim Crow South), get jobs where they have been purposefully denied them, 
  and move on up and out. What the free riders have done is guarantee more rationale 
  for the White plantation bureaucrats as more and more Blacks, <strong>despite</strong> 
  the attempts to hold them back (see Interludes 2 and 10 of my book), have escaped. 
  Indeed, the whole movement to include non-Blacks in civil rights is to maintain 
  a constituency and thus both jobs for them and votes for the Party, as Blacks, 
  no thanks to Whites, moved into the middle class during the second half of the 
  20th century faster than any group in the history of the U.S. All the more reason 
  for cities to concentrate Blacks in poverty and crime zones to keep them uneducated, 
  unemployed, unqualified, and thus in need of their services which means the 
  service providers get to keep their jobs and their "clients&#8221; get to stay 
  ghettoized and disempowered. The goal should be to work themselves out of a 
  job not guarantee them on the backs of those they are supposed to help. This 
  is the best case for privatizing some of these services. 
<p>In August 2003, the first set of ratings came out regarding the "Leave No Child 
  Behind&#8221; requirements. And who was left behind, and by affirmative action 
  no less? Minorities: Blacks and Hispanics and special education children. Here 
  is the kicker: some states, which have a high percentage of White students, 
  had never included their minority students in their statistics before, as they 
  left out low-income and/or special education students, in order to get high 
  scores. No wonder the Democrats opposed "Leave no child behind.&#8221; It exposes 
  the truth of the Democrats' education system: geared to Whites and the affluent. 
  For example, one state has 75% White students and yet set goals of "passing&#8221; 
  for a school low: 40% to pass reading and writing tests, 39% for math to pass, 
  and 68% have to graduate. Am I the only one doing the math here? 40% reading 
  and writing and 39% math and yet they still expect 68% to graduate? How? Simple. 
  The great majority of Whites graduate whereas the majority of minorities (Blacks 
  and Hispanics) do not. 
<p>This is dumbing down is unbelievable. What Whites don't get is that it dumbs 
  down their kids as well. And then people want to know why 2/3 of students entering 
  college don't graduate. <strong>Restorative</strong> Affirmative Action is needed 
  here so that all are accounted for and the poor records of Blacks and Hispanics 
  are not allowed to be hidden in the aggregate. Before schools didn't test problem 
  kids. Leave No Child Behind requires testing 95% of the students. Hence, "all 
  of sudden,&#8221; most schools can't pass. They blame the White House rather 
  than who they see in the mirror. 
<p>Now non-impoverished middle class people, mostly White, who are not poor, but 
  are gay/GLBT, disabled, feminist, ethnic, or members of other self defined "minorities&#8221; 
  are able to fill in for Blacks leaving and thus enable the centralized power 
  of the Democrats in the inner cities to continue. Of these groups, only the 
  disabled are truly different and require a different approach. 
<p>Certainly the integrity of all human beings and their equality as citizens 
  must be held as paramount, and certainly, at one and another times, Blacks and 
  women and gays and the physically disabled have been denied their integrity 
  as human beings and their rights and equality as citizens. This must always 
  be fought. But this doesn't lessen the argument: non-descendants of slaves are 
  still free riders when compared to descendants of slaves. None of them are in 
  the same league as descendants of slaves. Thus there should be no discrimination 
  or legal penalties directed at them, just as, on the other hand, all other free 
  riders need to be separate from "restorative affirmative action&#8221; for the 
  descendents of America's slaves. 
<p><strong>7. Let's Look to the Past and the Present So We Can Better Prepare 
  for the Future</strong><a name="Future"></a> 
<p>Historically, affirmative action was to <strong>restore</strong> us Blacks 
  to our rightful place in the line and at the table with all other citizens. 
  <strong>Slavery</strong> held us back 200 years until the Civil War. <strong>Jim 
  Crow</strong> held us back 88 years from 1876 to 1964. <i><strong>The Kerner 
  Commission Report</strong></i> in 1968 began the delay that has lasted since 
  then, another 35 years since that report, which said that we can't make it on 
  our own and established policy directions that continue to attempt to hold us 
  back, succeeding in education in general and in the inner cities in particular. 
  It's lame "two nations, one White and one Black&#8221; has been used to hold 
  us back on the notion that there is nothing that can be done about it (held 
  by the naive who aren't into the vision thing and by those who are evil enough 
  to deny us our equal rights as we are seen as not equal and thus must be kept 
  in our place). 
<p>Those accepting the notion in the short chapter on Blacks in the book <i><strong>The 
  Bell Curve</strong></i> that says we are too dumb to make it on our own use 
  &#8220;junk science&#8221; to "scientifically&#8221; rationalize holding us 
  back. <strong>Government programs</strong> which continue to keep poor Blacks 
  plantationed in the inner cities hold our hope, our young people, back, by continuing 
  a system with a huge disparity in learning. Nonetheless, we are striving mightily 
  and have made great progress despite the de facto and de jure laws against us 
  (see Interludes 5 and 7 of my book). So, in the words of Moses, "let my people 
  go.&#8221; Let my people participate in the American Dream as participants, 
  not as by standers. We need to <strong>affirm restorative affirmative action&#8221;.</strong> 
<p>The current form of affirmative action has little to do with Blacks and more 
  to do with jobs of those Whites who are "servicing&#8221; minority programs, 
  who have in turn become free riders as well: so-called planners, educators, 
  therapists and social workers, the whole K-12 complex that gets more and more 
  money for its employees as they do less and less for their inner city students, 
  etc. But again, as this &#8220;keep them in their place gap&#8221; seems to 
  be the desire of the party bosses, their is no urgency to change, only the urgency 
  to prevent programs that could close the gaps, such as charter schools, vouchers, 
  greater use of Internet based distand learning, and concentrating on knowledge 
  content instead of educational process, and having teachers trained in knowledge 
  content rather than in teaching methodology. Its like giving soldiers guns without 
  bullets. 
<p>What good is process and methodology without practical knowledge (reading, 
  writing and &#8216;rithmeticking) to teach as opposed to ideologically based 
  interpretations (culture war social issues) presented through the feel good 
  lens of what is supposed to raise self esteem (do what feels good), when becoming 
  good at learning content will provide that self esteem. The evidence showing 
  that even in low-income schools, content-rich, test-proven methods succeed. 
  There plenty of successful programs (being fought by the educational establishment) 
  run by educators of all ethnicities (Newark, South Boson Harbor, New haven, 
  Los Angeles, Chicago, Milwaukee) and the opposition to them offers more proove 
  that change is not desired in inner city schools by the ruling political party 
  in the cities as it could lead to their rebellion, as they attempt to keep their 
  dependent voters under control and in their vote column. 
<p>Thus, I am for <strong>"Restorative</strong> Affirmative action.&#8221; This 
  is not about feelings and their interpretations. This is about empirical evidence 
  clear to all who will look at it. The evidence regarding the plantation mentality 
  of Whites trying to keep as many Blacks down as they can is abundant (see my 
  book, especially chapters 7, 8, and 9, on education, housing and jobs). We need 
  to end the distortions and corruptions of the Declaration and Constitution as 
  they relate to such terms as freedom and liberty and democracy and the equal 
  access/equal opportunity to prosperity that they foster. And in terms of education, 
  the need is not the college or law school, is the primary school. 
<p>The learning gap first appears in primary school, and is almost hardened in 
  place by 4th grade. All the affirmative action dances done by vain glorious 
  activists regarding Ivy League schools and leading law schools are window dressing 
  to the real deal: the systematic clubbing of our cubs in primary schools, where 
  they learn helplessness and hopelessness, and then Whites wonder why so many 
  wind up dead or in jail before they are 30. The answer is simple. It is because 
  that is how Whites have voted. 
<p>If the NAACP marched and worked for this one goal alone, closing the educational 
  achievement gap, in order to help in the assuring that our young Black kids 
  enter middle school at the same learning level as Whites, it will have done 
  more for the future of the descendents of slaves in general and America in particular 
  than with any other project or program it now has, and will have finally justified 
  its continued existence, as the futures of our young all begins or ends with 
  education. I&#8217;ve been told that for those of our own Black naysayers, saying 
  it will take generations, that there is a book out there that says otherwise: 
  <i>No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning, </i>by Abigail and Stephen 
  Thernstrom. That is what we should be addressing, not the specific Superintendent 
  chosen by the Board. The board chooses the conductor it wants to lead its educational 
  orchestra. They choose the music. They set real goals and goals good for public 
  relations but not attaining change. 
<p>Let us be clear about what we are talking about: the cities of America are 
  about nothing short of the purposeful and intentional attempts to manage social 
  change, what some call social engineering. No one should be surprised by that. 
  Every culture is about social management. The political question of significance 
  through time is always the same: "who benefits,&#8221; and what to do when the 
  consequences are not beneficial? In other words, what is "a good society&#8221; 
  and what can we do to increase the chances that ours will be "good&#8221; for 
  as many as is possible? Instead, I submit that the social change we see is that 
  aimed at maintaining the status quo. We'll soon know whether the California 
  recall will break the status and "hegemony of the quo&#8221; or will itself 
  be broken by the status quo. 
</strong></i></strong>
<p><strong><strong><strong>8.The "Tiger Woods Rule.&#8221; </strong></strong></strong></p>
<strong><i><strong><strong> 
<p>The first question is this: who is "affirmative action,&#8221; today, really 
  for? Clearly it has been diluted, and is no longer for the descendents of America's 
  slaves, as originally intended. It has become a jobs program for middle class 
  White liberals running liberal programs that provide them with retirement and 
  health benefits but not those they are to serve. It is for those who "service&#8221; 
  Blacks, multiculturalism and diversity. And this part of the discussion doesn't 
  even begin to discuss how these middle class White planners funnel/conduit tax 
  funds for White developers building subsidized "affordable&#8221; housing for 
  big fees at tax payer expense after which few Blacks wind up living in what 
  then become gentrified housing for Whites. 
<p>The country has "moved on&#8221; and is now embracing what could be called 
  "The Tiger Woods Rule,&#8221; which is that we are now a nation that recognizes 
  the primacy of multi-racial groups over mono-racial Blacks, which are considered 
  by too many as better breeds than those who are just Black (and more likely 
  to be descendents of slaves). <strong>With the "The Tiger Woods Rule,&#8221; 
  Whites win (as always) and Blacks lose, as all other groups, especially mixed 
  ones, are inserted below Whites and above Blacks, shoving Blacks further down 
  the societal mobility totem pole, closer to where Blacks "belong,&#8221; or, 
  in James Baldwin's eloquent words, "putting the Ni**ers back in their place.&#8221;</strong> 
<p>According to the July 19-25, 2003 TV Guide, pp. 23-24, all Black programs like 
  "The Cosby Show&#8221;, "Good Times&#8221;, "Sanford and Son&#8221;, won't be 
  made again, and, recent shows, like "Cedric the Entertainer Presents&#8221; 
  (the most watched show by Blacks), "The Bernie Mac Show&#8221;, "Eve&#8221;, 
  and "One on One&#8221;, with all Black casts, must now diversify to stay on 
  the air (of course our self-appointed so-called "Black leaders&#8221; started 
  this when they attacked shows like Amos and Andy but raised nary a word about 
  the Beverly Hillbillies). 
<p>In other words, "The Black show&#8230;is dead.&#8221; No longer can there be 
  all Black shows. They must now have Whites. Mind you, no one is making all White 
  shows have Blacks. This is the dark side of Affirmative Action in its current 
  practice as a program now defined as diversity and multiculturalism for which 
  the only conclusion can be that anything all Black is not good. This is another 
  corruption of the current ideology of the left that is used to put others ahead 
  of Blacks. This is an important topic because when it gets twisted and used 
  as a weapon, Black "spokesmen&#8221; and "Black organizations&#8221; benefit, 
  but not Blacks as individuals or citizens. And it is Blacks succeeding as individuals 
  and citizens that is my goal, not so-called Black leaders and their organizations 
  masquerading as THE spokespersons for Blacks (see my Solution Paper <a href="13emergency.htm"> 
  NAACP Takes Eye Off Prize.</a> on my web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com). 
<p>Now I know some Blacks and some liberals and the entire far left is saying 
  that I am speaking <strong>heresy.</strong> True that. But I'll put my 40 years 
  working the streets of the community over their ivory tower lives any day of 
  the week. And just what is heresy? It comes from the Greek word "herein,&#8221; 
  which means <strong>"to choose.&#8221;</strong> I choose. They dictate. It is 
  the Democrats and the NAACP that doesn't want Blacks to choose even more than 
  Whites don't want us to choose. They want us to follow their Plantation order. 
  You think I'm exaggerating? Then you haven't read my book and the wealth of 
  data and evidence I bring to bear to support my argument. Read the book and 
  then tell me I'm exaggerating. I welcome the discussion. You can order the book 
  at www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. 
<p>I maintain that I take the high road and its moral high ground whereas the 
  Democrats and the NAACP have taken the immoral, unethical low ground. Answer 
  this: what is more important: Blacks as individuals or only Blacks as followers 
  of the Democrats and the NAACP? If the Democrats and NAACP are not supporting 
  us, why continue to support them? This is why I say I am a Nellie Stone Johnson 
  Democrat (the founder of the Farm Labor party in Minnesota who was sought out 
  by Hubert Humphrey to join the Democratic Party; she said fine, as long as all 
  three names were used. And then after merging the smallest Minnesota Party, 
  the Democrats, with hers, they eased her out. HHH championed civil rights for 
  everywhere but Minnesota (see Interlude 3 of my book). 
<p>And what is at the pinnacle of the high road's high ground? The Golden Rule 
  (see Chapter 5 of my book). Please note that all major religions endorse the 
  golden rule. We need to do so also. In my book, on p. 98, I write: "If we followed 
  the Golden Rule, we would not need affirmative action or the Voting Rights Act. 
  That we need these shows the <strong>unfairness </strong> that is not only tolerated 
  but also is purposely and intentionally attempted&#8221; and practiced. This 
  paper builds on what I have written in my book. It is important to understand 
  that it is not just Whites that are putting Blacks down through Affirmative 
  Action, it is Black organizations like the NAACP as well. 
<p>We also need to combine blame of the traditional "whine&#8221; that "its the 
  man&#8221; with blame also for our institutions (education, police, city council, 
  city bureaus) and that of individual behavior. History teaches us that people 
  have free will and are thus are free to do good or ill. There are people who 
  do evil. And if they make institutions evil it still is by free individuals 
  free to change them back. 
<p>People blame the economy, families (especially parents), capitalism, racism 
  and differentness (such as race), as the culprits. Think again. These are all 
  run by individuals. Missing this understanding has led to an obsession with 
  negotiation (see the <a href="08conflictresmodel.htm">18 Models of Conflict 
  Resolution</a> paper in the Solution Papers section of my web site) to see how 
  true this is. Evil exists (if it doesn't, what do you label slavery, genocide, 
  infanticide, or the atrocities I write about in the "Interludes&#8221; of my 
  book, especially Interludes 2, 8, 10, 14-15, to name just a few?). Each of us 
  is capable of evil. People are not basically good. It takes work and effort, 
  made easier by agreed upon values about civility, fairness, and a level playing 
  field. We have to work at it. 
<p>Hence, we need rational analysis of our behavior, which is why I recommend 
  a set of desired YESes and undesired NOs (in Chapters 5 and 17 of my book) as 
  the base for developing a common ground for us all, as well as a calculus to 
  use for evaluating them in Interlude 16. We can't get to the YESes and dispense 
  with the NOs until we accept that evil exists, and thus look at our situations 
  as something other than something that needs "educating others&#8221; (refusing 
  to recognize that they are acting intentionally) or "better understanding&#8221; 
  of what "led them&#8221; to behave as they did, as if no individual is responsible 
  for his or her behaviors. 
<p>And what is the Democratic Party doing about this? We used to celebrate being 
  American while welcoming people of every ethnic, linguistic, racial and religious 
  background and invite and show them how to become this new, non-ethnic entity 
  known an "American.&#8221; The new emphasis on ethnicity (blood) and race would 
  have Nellie Stone Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. turning in their graves. 
  They would also spin in their graves at this White plantationism at the expense 
  of both Blacks and American exceptionalism. This notion that immigrants need 
  not be united by English, and no longer become an American but a ________ (fill 
  in the blank hyphenated with a separate identity and values system) is a recipe 
  for the breakdown of our country. 
<p>To consider America a land of many cultures, united merely by accident of geography, 
  is one more way in which Democrats justify putting everyone else at the head 
  of the line ahead of the descendents of America's slaves. We do all of us a 
  disservice when we encourage or ignore fellow citizens to think of themselves 
  not as Americans, as one, but as members instead of a "better&#8221; group based 
  on ethnic, racial or sexual minorities. This is merely reviving the worst aspects 
  of municipal tribalism. The genius of our country, and why people fight to come 
  here, not fight to leave, has been the flexibility to allow all their privacy 
  behind closed doors who nonetheless become united by one language and one sense 
  of civility in the public square. 
<p>The Democratic Party tells us to wait while it tells those it is trying to 
  sway to get their votes that they don't have to become Americans, that taxpayers 
  and the descendents of slaves will step aside while Democrats pay for the education, 
  free health care and a driver&#8217;s license (with which they can then vote 
  for the Democrats) of illegals until they too get cast aside like us for the 
  next group of people to make dependent and faithful voters. This is the clearest 
  evidence of the "hate America&#8221; crowd in America: don't bother becoming 
  an American citizen, and because we are so bad we "owe&#8221; you these benefits. 
  No, not at all. But America DOES owe the descendents of slaves. What happened 
  to newcomers before they came to America was not done by America. Slavery was. 
  It must still be redressed. 
<p><strong>9. Open Borders For Illegal Aliens Continue The Democrats' Deferment<a name="Deferment"></a> 
  Of The Dreams Of The Descendents of America's Slaves. </strong> 
<p>In a recent column in The Washington Post by Michelle Malkin, we saw again 
  how the Democrats have proceeded to defer the dream of the descendents of America's 
  slaves. Illegal aliens are being allowed to obtain mortgages and homes, despite 
  their status, despite their overstaying their visas. Here's the kicker: its 
  legal, and thus Democrats recruit, harbor and encourage illegal aliens to do 
  so, at the expense of America's Blacks and, of course, America's majority White 
  tax payers (who showed they "get it&#8221; by their California recall vote). 
  Malkin quotes a person in the California mortgage industry as saying: 
<ul>
  It boggles the mind to think how many illegal aliens are homeowners in this 
  country thanks to these programs, all fully insured by our government. Because 
  of fear of lawsuits for discrimination I can also tell you that a lender may 
  have a borrower who speaks little or no English who claims to be either a citizen 
  or resident alien and it will not be questioned nor any proof required. Since 
  FHA does not require any such documentation, a lender cannot cite their regulations 
  as a basis for the request as they can on conventional loans. 
</ul>
<p>How can the Democrats claim to be supportive of native born African American 
  descendents of slaves when they not only allow but encourage these practices? 
<p>Our theme here is <strong>restorative affirmative action.</strong> How can 
  that be achieved when the Democrats, in search of votes, encumber, as in California, 
  the state budget, hospitals, schools and prisons with illegal aliens, saying 
  it is OK for them to jump ahead of us to the front of the line? <i>The Los Angeles 
  Times</i> calls it &#8220;creating a Third World chaos in the California economy,&#8221; 
  and the new book <strong>&#8220;Mexifornia&#8221;</strong> by Hoover Institution 
  fellow and California State University Fresno professor Victor Davis Hanson 
  explains in detail the disastrous economic and moral results. 
<p>And who is asked to pay for this besides the taxpayer? Black workers. One example: 
  auto repair jobs that blacks used to hold at $25 an hour are now worked by illegals 
  at $8/hour. Besides harming the economy and deferring once again legitimate 
  claims of African Americans, it continues the dark side of diversity's "separatist 
  ideology,&#8221; harming the illegals too for without E pluribus Unum, out of 
  many one, that is to say, without "assimilation&#8221; and learning American 
  culture and language, they cannot succeed, as would be the case of any American 
  White person immigrating to another country and not learning and accepting their 
  culture and language. But the Democratic Party doesn't seek citizens (they could 
  vote against you). They seek more dependent voters. Am I opposed to immigrants? 
  Not at all. But get in line, please. 
<p>In terms of immigrants, even Don Samuels, Jamaican immigrant and Minneapolis 
  Council Member, is, as City Pages has pointed out, a person with "perspectives 
  framed by a can-do optimism that feels naive and anachronistic to many local 
  African Americans.&#8221; Why does this White alternative newspaper, usually 
  quite good in its reporting, say that inner city American Blacks feel "can do&#8221; 
  is naive and anachronistic? In reality they see, with the policies regarding 
  education, jobs, and housing, that the problem is not their lack of "can do&#8221; 
  but the city's policy toward them of "you can't do.&#8221; This isn't helped 
  by the deferments of slavery (when we were allowed to do nothing and taught 
  hopelessness and helplessness), Jim Crow (when the Emancipation was shackled 
  legally in the South making personal progress along side Whites impossible, 
  dashing dreams all the more and causing even more hopelessness, although not 
  all dreams, as Martin Luther King, Jr. reminded everyone in August of 1968: 
  see my <a href="14unfinsheddream.htm"> Unfinished Dream </a> Solution Paper 
  on my web site), and the 1968 Kerner commission report which said we weren't 
  like other immigrants who could do the "can do&#8221; thing, that we can't make 
  it on our own, and therefore will remain dependent on government. In their self 
  fulfilling prophecy they then passed laws and regulations that ensured that 
  we could not. 
<p>Despite this, many Blacks have shown they "can do&#8221; and have made it. 
  But too many in the inner cities, especially young Black men, are still being 
  deferred and kept off track. 300 plus years of "can't do&#8221; has an effect. 
  We must end the wrong headed assumptions of city/state/federal government about 
  Blacks "can't do&#8221; and bring our young people, especially the young men, 
  to learn optimism, self validation, and self affirmation. Which is why there 
  is suspicion of Samuels in the Minneapolis Black community. He identifies, as 
  a Jamaican "can do&#8221; with White America's "can do&#8221; and doesn't believe 
  American Blacks descended from slaves can. And yet the other Black Minneapolis 
  Council Member, Natalie Johnson-Lee, is proof that American Blacks "can do.&#8221; 
<p>Whether White or Black, we need people in government who understand the struggle 
  to get to even considering "can do,&#8221; let alone acting on it, and the steps 
  needed to teach skills, optimism, and hope. This is why I have gathered the 
  problem resolution suggestions in my Book in another Solution Paper on my web 
  page: <a href=22actualize.htm>Seven Solutions</a>. The paper's full title is: 
  <strong>"7 Key Themes, 7 Key Problems, And 7 Key Solutions For Solving The Problems 
  Of America&#8217;s Inner Cities In Order To Stop Deferring The Dream And To 
  Actualize It.&#8221;</strong> 
<p><strong>10. Inner Cities As Plantations </strong> 
<p>Black inner city Plantation leaders too often continue the monstrous injustice 
  of American history by constantly playing both the "race card&#8221; and the 
  "we represent Blacks&#8221; card when, instead, they should be working for Restorative 
  Affirmative action, restoring Blacks to full citizenship, equal access, equal 
  opportunity, and a chance for prosperity through true education and meeting 
  job qualification to enable equal pay jobs, and equal access housing, not to 
  mention small business and entrepreneurial enterprises. 
<p>We all know that affirmative action was originally created to deal with admitted 
  <strong>unfairness and injustice</strong> of forcing Africans and their descendents 
  into slavery. This was a monstrous violation of the Constitution of the Declaration's 
  central tenet that "all men are created equal.&#8221; The Constitution said 
  slaves were not equal, and even for counting purposes, equaled only .75 of a 
  person. 
<p>And even though at the time slavery was legal and accepted world wide, slavery 
  was still a particularly monstrous violation of what makes America the exceptional 
  nation for, unlike other countries, we espoused that just rule proceeds only 
  from the consent of the governed. Through slavery and Jim Crow, that consent 
  was denied. The Kerner Commission Report of 1968 was unable to overturn the 
  1964 voting rights act but did provide for as many blocks as possible by saying 
  Blacks are not equal in different terms: not like others, can't make it on their 
  own, hold back, don't try, be wards of the Democratic party. 
<p>Ending slavery was a moral imperative, just as ending slavery anywhere in the 
  world today is a moral imperative whether people want to admit that or not. 
  But ending it is not enough. We must also <strong>restore</strong> what was 
  lost by Blacks by having had to endure slavery, Jim Crow, and the policies resulting 
  from the Kerner Report. 
<p>Whether we should be the liberators of others (i.e., Iraq) is still an open 
  question. But who better than the descendents of slaves to understand the agony 
  of those in countries like Iraq and North Korea and Syria, or Egypt, as well 
  as countries in the sub-Sahara, and what has to be their peoples' desire to 
  be freed from their slavery and tyranny? Surely ending slavery and oppression 
  is a moral imperative, e.g., in Iraq and in other countries in Africa and the 
  Middle East or how else can we complain about our own past slavery or our continued 
  plantationing in the inner cities? 
<p>We know we are in Alice in Wonderland thinking when both the Democrats and 
  UN Secretary General Kofi Annan call for "regime change&#8221; in Washington, 
  D.C. but didn't for Iraq nor do they for other tyrannies. Personally, I opposed 
  the War on Iraq, believing it could be handled through the U.N. I still believe 
  that it was possible. But possible and probable are two different things. The 
  U.N. refused, making the possible improbable. And as of this writing, it continues 
  to refuse. It bothered me then and it bothers me now: I hear more opposition 
  toward President Bush than I did for Saddam Hussein. How can the UN claim legitimacy, 
  and how can the Democratic Party continue to say we should be under the UN umbrella, 
  when the UN is led by dictators each with long lists of human rights violations, 
  especially for our ancestors in Africa and we Democrats don't call them on it? 
<p>And let's be clear: slavery still exists, something the U.N. has not been able 
  and/or not been willing to try to eliminate. According to the Anti-Slavery Society 
  in London, some form of slavery exists in almost every nation, ranging from 
  oppressive labor and debt bondage to the more rare chattel slavery, which is 
  what the Old South was about: where people are actually owned by another. In 
  1986, the society reported that 150 million were in one or more of this type 
  of bondage world wide. Today, it says that 50 million are in debt bond alone 
  and that 179 million children are in the worst forms of child labour, while 
  the International Labour Organization (ILO), says there are about 211 million 
  working children between the ages of five and 14 years old, of which 49% are 
  girls. 
<p>So this is still a world-wide problem. And when the U.N. actively works to 
  end it, I'll be more inclined to listen to them. And how can the NAACP, who 
  knows about the horrors of slavery better than any expend efforts with African 
  heads of state who deny their people freedom and liberty rather than work with 
  the political leaders of this country for restorative affirmative action in 
  our inner city? See my <a href="12eyeoffprize.htm"> NAACP Takes Eye Off Prize.</a> 
  Solution Paper on my web page. 
<p><strong>My concern, as expressed in my book (see Chapter 14), is that the original 
  goal of affirmative action has been changed to exclude or dilute or block or 
  prevent gains by Blacks,</strong> as the emphasis now is on White women, ethnic 
  groups, sexual orientation, non-Christian religions, the disabled, newly arrived 
  immigrant groups, speakers of languages other than English, etc. In the same 
  way that moral equivalency has ruined our foreign policy debates (with arguments 
  that began by equating 9/11 as our fault, and thus justified, and then moving 
  on to such a low common denominator of ignorance, comparing America with Nazi 
  Germany and Bush with Hitler). 
<p>These are hindering the attempt to redress the holding back imposed on Blacks 
  since we first stepped foot on these shores. So how can middle class women be 
  equated with unemployed Black sharecroppers? How can prosperous GLBT folks be 
  equated with ghetto kids? How can non-English speaking newly arrived immigrants 
  of any kind be compared to the Jim Crowed and Kernered descendants of slaves 
  who are ghettoized and disempowered and clustered in inner city ghettoes and 
  projects and impact zones? How can White, educated, middle class professionals 
  in these other categories make claim to be in need of their civil rights in 
  the same manner as the descendants of slaves and then without a qualm move themselves 
  to the head of the line ahead of the descendants of slaves? How? By controlling 
  the legislation. Why? Because they can. How? This is how the left has classified 
  themselves and declassified Blacks. 
<p>These other groups have been turned into affirmative action groups in order 
  to protect and increase the jobs of government bureaucrats: service/therapeutic/education 
  jobs by establishing the equivalent of quotas for these other groups so that 
  the government bureaucracies job bases expand not contract. The Democrats back 
  this in their attempt to expand their voting base. The sacrificial lambs? America's 
  descendents of slaves. The result: the historic repeat of pushing Blacks out 
  of the way. And Black organizations, such as the NAACP, stand by and do little. 
  Why? Because they don't want to make mad the government, foundations and private 
  groups that provide their salaries, for the NAACP has become their career, not 
  their cause, their personal prize not the vehicle to fight for the prize for 
  all Blacks. 
<p>Quotas for all self-proclaimed groups with a grievance supported by professionals 
  paid to foster and work with their grievances, cancel out the moral imperative 
  on which affirmative action was initially based. This is why I say change the 
  name of affirmative action to <strong> "Restorative</strong> Affirmative action.&#8221; 
  The numbers quoted in my book about the poor education of inner city Blacks 
  (Chapter 7), the poor housing of inner city Blacks (Chapter 8) and the lack 
  of jobs for inner city Blacks (Chapter 9), gets lost in the emphasis to help 
  groups that don't need the help and which, together, essentially kick inner 
  city Blacks further down the latter of social mobility and success. By definition, 
  then, any who support these groups as well as new immigrant groups over the 
  descendants of America's slaves are just siding with a more pernicious and more 
  difficult kind of Jim Crow approach to America's descendents of slaves in order 
  to, again, "keep them in their place.&#8221; 
<p>The great social movement for civil rights for Blacks has been turned into 
  a cottage industry of job rights for the White bureaucrats and planners and 
  project managers as well as therapists and social workers and so-called educators, 
  all of whom run the poverty and education and minority programs as well as disburse 
  the crumbs they throw to the Blacks in the inner cities who carry their water 
  and participate in this scam, especially organizations like the Minneapolis 
  local branch of the NAACP (as well as the national NAACP; again: see the "Solution 
  Papers&#8221; section of this web site for this <a href="12eyeoffprize.htm"> 
  NAACP Takes Eye Off Prize.</a> paper and its July 2003 convention in Miami). 
<p><strong> 11. The Supreme Court Decision: does it really make a difference<a name="difference?"></a>? 
  I don't think so.</strong></p>
<p>Will the Supreme Court decision really make a difference? When news comments 
  have groups across the political spectrum claiming victory with the decision, 
  one should be wary. What does it really mean to say that preferences should 
  be limited a little bit, that they can be given but can't be abused? Some would 
  do less, some more. How does that help? What is abuse? Is there such a thing 
  as a little bit enslaved or a little bit pregnant? You are or you are not. 
<p>How about the abuse of 200 years of slavery and 80 years of Jim Crow and 35 
  years since the 1968 Kerner Commission Report of trying to disguise Jim Crow 
  in the inner cities? 
<p>With everyone rolling over and saying nothing other than "we won,&#8221; how 
  can any claim the status quo has really been changed? <strong>How has the decision 
  tangibly helped inner city Blacks with education, housing and jobs, as discussing 
  it at the college level is too late: the majority of inner city Blacks have 
  already been disqualified from college, hence the use of affirmative action 
  to cover this.</strong> With no forums really discussing and debating the decision 
  in terms of individual citizenship as opposed to differently aggrieved groups, 
  can we not conclude that all of these various commentators claiming a valedictory 
  really just want to maintain the status quo? This means the groups involved, 
  not to mention college admissions departments and Black organizations playing 
  their race card to get contributions to keep themselves and their jobs funded, 
  keep their jobs, and go on with business as usual. 
<p>Just as red lining ghettoizes Blacks in housing, affirmative action "race lining&#8221; 
  also ghettoizes Blacks intellectually, tagging them as maybe being good but 
  still not as good as Whites, which means no progress at all. Worse, it goes 
  against Martin Luther King's goal of defining ourselves by our character, not 
  our color. When color becomes important, we become unimportant. What we see 
  is the work of people protecting their vested interests, which goes against 
  the potential benefit to poor and underprivileged Blacks, especially in the 
  inner cities (under educated, under employed, poorly housed). 
<p><strong>Affirmative action was originally designed to give individuals an opportunity 
  to catch up with the opportunities in society, to have the same chances to climb 
  the ladder of social mobility.</strong> The Black underclass, like the White 
  underclass, and like the underclass in any society, is not there because of 
  having or not having affirmative action. It is due to the political and cultural 
  issues (i.e., the oft repeated periods of slavery, Jim Crow, Kerner Commission 
  and Bell Curve). Affirmative action was to address the negatives of these political 
  issues, not prolong them. 
<p>The danger of this is now seen in the NAACP seeing itself as a player on the 
  world stage of other countries with their peoples of color, societies with economic 
  and social dynamics the NAACP knows nothing about, as their problems are NOT 
  problems of color but <strong>(1)</strong> problems of local culture and their 
  distinctive histories, politics, ideologies, religions, and political philosophies 
  and <strong>(2)</strong> their lack of adherence to proven concepts for individuals 
  of liberty, justice, democracy, private property ownership, and individual rights 
  as opposed to group rights based solely on color, and <strong>(3)</strong> the 
  failure to use proven concepts for government and social institutions. 
<p>Africa, with all of its wealth of resources, should be a prosperous continent 
  from the Mediterranean to the Horn of South Africa. Ditto Russia and its 11 
  time zones of resources of oil, gold, timber, minerals, farm land, etc. Both 
  are at the bottom. Both lack freedom and democracy. One White, one Black, both 
  with poor, unfree populations. Neither have a market economy. Neither respect 
  personal freedoms. Neither encourage wide spread ownership of private property. 
  Neither has a true system of checks and balances. Neither has a federal system. 
  So it has nothing to do with color. It has all to do with the system, and so 
  far, historically, the American system has proven to be the best. These values 
  that ensure economic and political progress are universals, not tribal or ethnic 
  or racial. Nationalism, Socialism and Racism are all failed systems (see Solution 
  Paper <a href= https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/appendd.htm">The Economics 
  of Racism</a> on my web site). So why can't both political parties celebrate 
  these universal values and why won't the "Black leadership&#8221; not only celebrate 
  them but return to its civil rights roots and seek them for all Blacks, not 
  just those in leadership positions? My concern is that too many of these value 
  systems stop at the city line and are denied to inner city descendents of slaves 
  because they are subjected to a school system that, believing they can't make 
  it and need be wards of the state, need not do a lot with the students, and 
  who are subjected to a city work force whose jobs depend on their being kept 
  in their place. 
<p><strong>12. College<a name="College"></a> affirmative action acts as a distraction 
  and cover from the real abuse: Failed Public Education For Blacks: K-12.</strong> 
<p>"Failure&#8221; is in the eye of the beholder. Indeed, "failure&#8221; is an 
  interpretation of expectation. If you don't expect much there is little chance 
  of failure. I expect much. I believe public schools, taking tax payer dollars, 
  are both professionally and morally obligated <strong>to see that every student 
  in each grade, K-12, is reading, writing and 'rithmeticking at grade level.</strong> 
  Not all agree, meaning both the teaching profession and the courts. As noted 
  on Chapter 7, on Education, in my book, a New York judge ruled in 2002 (New 
  York Supreme Court Appellate Division), that, overturning a lower court's ruling 
  that <strong>the state had failed to provide "a sound, basic education&#8221;</strong> 
  for the students, as required by the New York State constitution. However, the 
  Appellate Court said that was OK, as, ruling 4-1, the state is <strong>only 
  obligated to provide a "minimally adequate opportunity, which it defined as 
  an eighth grade education,</strong> which the court said the schools were already 
  providing. The one dissenting judge said this meant <strong>that the state had 
  "no meaningful obligation to provide any high school education at all.&#8221;</strong> 
<p>In other words, when schools and judges in Minnenapolis are saying the schools 
  are providing, do they mean K-12 or eighth grade? If you accept the New York 
  ruling, Minneapolis provides. If you accept my interpretation that all should 
  be at grade level, K-12, they do not. The schools are providing "minimal education&#8221; 
  and considering it OK just as those who accept as OK "minimum wages&#8221; on 
  which a full time worker cannot support his or her family (and often two on 
  minimum wage cannot). Accepting the minimum is accepting the mediocre. I do 
  not accept. And now the final statement from that court: the majority of the 
  judges said that "Society needs workers in all levels of jobs, the majority 
  of which may very well be low level.&#8221; So there you have it. <strong>An 
  elitist group rules for the masses. And yet, even at McDonalds, the workers 
  have to be able to read, work a cash register, and offer accurate change. </strong> 
<p>Is it Blacks or society? The reality is, according to science, that we all 
  belong to the same race: the human race. "Race&#8221; is a new construct. It 
  means little biologically although there can be meaning in ancestry or ethnicity. 
  But, as the Democrats control the inner city schools and as the inner city schools 
  perform low according to my criteria, but NOT according to these judges, I can 
  only conclude that the DFL in Minneapolis assumes Black students are not capable 
  of achieving K-12 grade level the same as Whites. This, clearly, is racist. 
<p>Racism is the affirmation of the falsehood that inequality is inevitable due 
  to race differences. In reality, inequalities are due to internal (self) and 
  external (culture/societal laws), neither of which are based on race or color. 
  Club them and the inner self shuts down. Believe they can&#8217;t do it and 
  no attempt is truly made to try. If public schools adopted proven curriculum 
  and best practices, we would see a difference. Obviously, with education spending 
  having increased 50% over the past 20 years with worse results for inner city 
  Blacks, the reality is clear to any but an ideologue who worships narrow party 
  ideas over proven facts, or those who both give to and receive money for Democratic 
  Party political campaigns. <strong>Poor education is always defined by the professionals 
  as due to the lack of funding and thus solvable only with more money,</strong> 
  and as long as that remains the definition, the status quo will merrily continue 
  to condemn young Blacks, especially young Black men, to poor performances, which 
  many will &#8220;tsk tsk&#8221; and then go on, merrily delighted that the status 
  quo means they get to keep their jobs and obtain ever higher salaries and nicer 
  retirements. Indeed, even the "Leave No Child Behind&#8221; program is accused 
  of being under funded. Yet, the numbers suggest otherwise:

<p>The real issue is people, not government. The courts and the governments can 
  say and do what they want. But the key is people. As <strong>John Gardner,</strong> 
  former HEW Secretary used to say, <strong>the major changes in our society, 
  certainly those I'm most concerned with, came not from the public sector but 
  from the private sector and the religious sector:</strong> the abolition of 
  slavery, the reforms of populism, child labor laws, the vote for women, civil 
  rights, etc. After all, who or what were they fighting: the laws and regulations 
  of the public sector. 
<p>And here is another &#8220;dirty little secret:&#8221; The current effort to 
  achieve change by the Democrats with affirmative action through the public sector 
  falls far behind the efforts achieved, despite the public sector, by the private 
  and religious sectors, as both have done more than government (the military 
  being the major exception). Corporate management is far more integrated than 
  university faculties. Companies and churches are far more integrated than the 
  national Congress or state legislatures or either of their staffs. 
<p>Politicians like to posture. But they still behave as plantation masters. And 
  until these government groups/organizations/agencies match their rhetoric with 
  action, I reserve having any faith that their actions will amount to much. If 
  they don't change, the 25 years O'Conner talks about will just be as it has 
  been for the past 50 years, renewed once again, continuing the day of reckoning 
  for Blacks, who continue to pay the price, until the ultimate day of reckoning 
  that will have to be paid by Whites (who believe they can continuously postpone 
  it). 
<p>A key problem now is that faith organizations, the source of much progress 
  and high moral ground, high road strength, have changed, both Black and White 
  fair organizations, as too often, they now follow the public sector, as if they 
  were a branch of it, rather than play its historic role of trying to lead with 
  a prophetic voice, of which Martin Luther King, Jr., is the best example. 
<p>Andrew Sullivan, on his web log, comments on the Jeff Rosen piece in the June 
  2, 2003 Sunday New York Times Magazine,&#8221;&#8221;, at http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/magazine/01ACTION.html. 
  Here is what Andy Sullivan (www.andrewsullivan.com) said, 6-2-03, about the 
  article: 
<ul>
  Jeff is viscerally against affirmative action, but he has come to endorse it. 
  Why? Because if it&#8217;s abolished, universities will only opt for more egalitarian 
  methods to achieve racial diversity and could trash academic standards even 
  more thoroughly than the current system. It&#8217;s an argument of elegant surrender. 
  The assumption of his case - indeed of the entire debate - is that minorities 
  will simply as a matter of fact always score lower in test scores. That&#8217;s 
  a given for the foreseeable future, if not for ever. <strong>Mickey Kaus once 
  described those liberals who simply assume the permanent neediness of minorities 
  as &#8220;Bell Curve Liberals,&#8221; people who would never admit it but have 
  internalized the notion that minorities are simply dumber than the majority.</strong> 
  They either believe that such inferiority is in part genetic and in part environmental 
  or entirely environmental. But the upshot is always the same: <strong>these 
  people are helpless; and all we can do is rig the system to disguise it as much 
  as possible and minimize social resentment and division.</strong> The only way 
  we can have racial integration in universities is therefore by destroying academic 
  standards. 
</ul>
<p>Sullivan says that the alternative to quotas is the evisceration of standards, 
  which will mean that "then we truly have lost our faith in the power of meritocracy 
  and the equality of the races.&#8221; Sullivan rejects what he calls a counsel 
  of despair. He says we need to "Keep the standards. Drop the quotas,&#8221; 
  that is, end affirmative action. And this is true, if affirmative action continues 
  to be run as a quota program. 
<p>What I am calling for is to return it to its original purpose: a <strong>restorative</strong> 
  program, not a quota program, a program with standards. What needs to be done 
  in higher education is to see that Blacks get admitted to the schools that match 
  their high school performance in terms of grades and SAT scores, and then make 
  sure that they also get into graduate school. Otherwise, we'll continue with 
  lily white universities using a quota rather than a standards approach to achieve 
  affirmative action, doing an injustice to all concerned, and extending their 
  cruel hypocrisy even further, as they take Blacks whose grades and SAT scores 
  don't match those of the non-affirmative action students, and thus the incoming 
  Blacks have a higher rate of dropping out. But this doesn't mean I dismiss Sullivan's 
  comment. It should be used as a standard to make sure that the evisceration 
  of standards does not occur and that the merit system and equality of the races 
  are allowed to move forward together in parallel, and use Restorative Affirmative 
  Action to identify and match those qualified with the appropriate schools. 
<p>How does one get to the holy grail of education, college, if not prepared by 
  the K-12 system? We should see a flood of young Black people heading for college. 
  Instead, we get a trickle. Instead we get whining from the Black community's 
  "Black leaders&#8221; on how deprived we are as the government or the man or 
  companies are not doing enough for us. But if our kids were educated they would 
  not speak like this, as they would recognize that they have to prepare and plan 
  for the future using their skills and knowledge. But how can they when they 
  are not prepared? The recipe for success is relatively simple: prepare for it, 
  develop a skill or expertise, practice it, get good at it, and apply it. This 
  will happen if they get a great education that teaches academics, skills, optimism 
  and hope. It is this that should be the focus of the NAACP, not gun control, 
  not Hollywood, not African dictators. The NAACP and any Black leaders should 
  be pushing for equal education that teaches academics, skills, optimism and 
  hope, and makes clear that by self-application, individual progress can be made 
  on the prosperity ladder of social mobility. And where should this emphasis 
  start? In the elementary schools. If the kids can't ready by 4th grade its over 
  according to most educators. Any yet when 68% of Black 4th graders can't read 
  to grade level, is there any wonder it all falls apart after that? If this was 
  the case with White children you'd see a change overnight. But if we fixed it, 
  you couldn't keep them in their place. So that's the first question to answer.</strong></strong></i></strong> 
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong> 13. Martin Luther King <a name="King"></a>Did 
  Not Favor Racial Preferences Nor Did He Favor Waiting: He favored action, assimilating 
  through integration.</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<strong><i><strong><strong><strong> 
<p>In Martin Luther King's time, "affirmative action&#8221; was not a much used 
  term. King favored preferences but not racial preferences. <strong>King favored 
  economic class-based preferences, what "liberation theology&#8221; calls </strong> 
<p><strong>"the preferential option for the poor,&#8221; both Black and White.</strong> 
  Thus we must be clear: he never publicly advocated what is now called "affirmative 
  action&#8221; in terms of school admissions or employment. He saw that as divisive. 
  He wanted nonracial economic class-based preferences to help the poor, both 
  Black and White poor. That would have worked. By making it &#8220;racial&#8221; 
  in The Kerner Commission Report, issued after King was assassinated, Blacks 
  could still be kept in their place. Nonetheless, they keep moving up and out. 
  My concern is for those still left behind in the inner cities, especially the 
  young men. See the Solution Papers section of this web site, <a href="14unfinsheddream.htm"> 
  Unfinished Dream </a> in honor of the 40th anniversary of his speech, and the 
  excerpts from The Playboy Interview with King. 
<p>But there is another reason, besides getting the job done, and why we need 
  to set 25 years and make it stick: federalism vs. nationalism. It is the sorry 
  practice of Democrats in the South which led to the rupture of federalism to 
  cause the national government to go beyond its powers to end Jim Crow. In an 
  ideal world, Barry Goldwater&#8217;s opposition to the Civil Rights Act in 1964, 
  on narrow constitutional grounds made sense, as it overrode states rights. But 
  to uphold that position, he had to assume Blacks in the Southern states were 
  fully protected and provided constitutional rights. But the real didn&#8217;t 
  match the ideal: those states with Jim Crow laws nullfied the 13, 14, and 15th 
  amendments, which abolished slavery, extended citizenship to freed slaves, and 
  protected the right to vote against racial discrimination. So from the standpoint 
  of these amendments, Barry Goldwater was dead wrong. And certainly, morally 
  and from the standpoint of the Declaration of Independence, he was wrong again. 
  We haven't trusted the Republicans since. The Republicans have yet to publicly 
  repudiate his stance. 
<p>So if the Republican Party apologizes today for Goldwater's position, and repudiates 
  the &#8220;they can&#8217;t make it on their own&#8221; position of The Kerner 
  Commission Report and The Bell Curve, we might believe they are finally the 
  party of the Big Tent and consider their invitation. We are still waiting. We 
  also want the Democrats to repudiate the "Blacks can't make it on their own&#8221; 
  policy foundation of the Kerner Commission Report. Finally, we want organizations 
  like the NAACP branch in Minneapolis to make the same repudiation instead of 
  saying we can&#8217;t, that it will take generations, and just leave it to them. 
<p>When people want to know what the Constitution means, they should check with 
  the Federalist Papers, where the basic discussions on that are gathered together. 
  Regardless of whether one is a strict constructionist or not, the Federalist 
  Papers are the definitive exposition of the Constitution&#8217;s original intent. 
  As James Madison, our Constitution&#8217;s author, stated, &#8220;Each State, 
  in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign body, independent 
  of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation, 
  then, the new Constitution will, if established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL 
  constitution&#8230;The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the 
  federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State 
  governments are numerous and indefinite.&#8221; The states used this to continue 
  slavery and, after the Civil War, to continue to deny Blacks freedom through 
  Jim Crow. Now the courts are using it to deny many things. We need to swing 
  back to a federal approach to state sovereignty with states being made to keep 
  their part of the bargain in following the constitution so that it applies to 
  all citizens, not just those they select. 
<p>14. Affirmative Action Causing Budget cuts to be taken as Black cuts<a name="black"></a>. 
<p>Will we see the numbers of African Americans increased in colleges and graduate 
  schools and government jobs or will we merely see a fewer number combined with 
  the statements "see, we have some,&#8221; now allowing fewer? 
<p>After Jim Crow, Blacks should have achieved leaps and bounds in education decades 
  ago, and yet the great disparity in education between Blacks and Whites still 
  exists, as discussed in Chapter 7 of my book, because policy keeps it so. Education 
  is the key to prosperity and getting ahead, and Blacks getting ahead are not 
  staying in their place. 
<p> And how about the job market: most of the states are now talking about massive 
  budget cuts. That means last in first out, so much of the gains made over the 
  past two decades by Blacks, the last in, could get wiped out ("hey, we'd like 
  to do better but we don't have any money&#8221; will be the cry to again see 
  to it that the money goes to protect jobs of government Whites, for who cares 
  about the Blacks as we know they'll always vote Democratic). The true proof 
  of Whites turning their backs on integration is when, in times of downturn and 
  austerity, the majority, percentage wise, of those laid off becomes Blacks and 
  other minorities. The question, therefore, is not how we preserve diversity, 
  whatever that means, but how we preserve fairness in terms of all citizens of 
  the city, not just White citizens. Will we really tolerate reverse affirmative 
  action: Blacks and minorities getting laid off first and in greater percentages 
  of their groups? All that does is affirm prejudice, segregation and separation, 
  and second class citizenship for inner city Blacks. We can handle prejudice. 
  It is the segregation and separation that is the killer. 
<p><strong>15. Supreme Court Ruling Could Lead to Benign Jim Crow, Benign<a name="Benign"> 
  </a> Apartheid , Benign Separate but Equal. </strong> 
<p>The late great Democratic Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan once offered the 
  suggestion of "benign neglect&#8221; as a way of letting Blacks work it out 
  on their own. Between the professional Democratic Party White caretakers and 
  Black organizations funded by the former, he lost out. His predictions regarding 
  the decline of inner cities and Black families, so castigated then, have been 
  borne out to be true. This means nothing to those whose jobs depend on the status 
  quo and get paid to be caretakers. <i>E pluribus Unum,</i> out of many comes 
  one, has been turned upside down and thus changed to out of one people comes 
  many separatist groups, each with its own funding base, each with its own group 
  of White bureaucrats, each a voting block for Democrats. With the Republicans 
  standing by smiling, for the more they can keep in the cities the fewer will 
  get into the middle class and out to the suburbs. It has been a good try. But 
  more Blacks by percentage have moved into the middle class than any other group. 
<p>We need to be race conscious only to the extent that it enables us to redress 
  wrongs. But the goal should still be to be a common people. This is the common 
  ground I discuss in Chapter 5 of my book. Instead, with all the separate interest 
  groups demanding cultural parity, the American culture suffers. The extremists 
  will find ways to take the Supreme Court decision and turn it into a mechanism 
  to divide the nation by race, not common principle, returning us to the 19th 
  century. The Constitution with its amendments, when properly applied and interpreted, 
  is color blind: Equal protection is for all, regardless of color. But to get 
  to color blind we must first get to equal protection. 
<p> <strong>16. Where is the NAACP <a name="NAACP"></a>in Minneapolis?</strong> 
<p>The greatest sadness to me is that the NAACP in Minneapolis remains mum. What 
  in the world do they stand for? It would seem the NAACP in Minneapolis stands 
  for whoever funds them. Their proclamations and declarations of vision and empirical 
  data and documentation appear to be part of an elaborate sham to protect themselves 
  and their jobs by not rocking the boat, by doing nothing, by not disturbing 
  the Whites who then see to it that they then keep getting funding for their 
  jobs. Is there any difference between the missing files of the NAACP branch 
  and former Council President Jackie Cherryhome's taken files? 
<p>What is the NAACP hiding? I suspect they are hiding proof of what I write. 
  The files of the NAACP are closed and the Ward files have disappeared. They 
  seem to believe few, if any, care. Let's go on record: we care. Do you? For 
  background on the local NAACP chapter, see Web Log entries 7, 18, 20, 23, 25, 
  28, 30, 33-35, 89-90, 95, 97-99, 107-108, 113, 123-124, 132-133, 137, 139-140, 
  142-143, 153, 162, 164-165, 167-169, 171, 174-175, 185. And to learn more about 
  the most recent, including their expelling me for speaking up, see web log entries 
  194-202. When they disqualified my voters, brought in White voters (85% of those 
  who voted for the winning candidate were White), they showed their true hand: 
  they stand not for the prize of freedom for those of us in the field but for 
  the prize of patronage for themselves for doing what the DFL bosses tell them 
  to do. As you can see from the entries above, my &#8220;platform,&#8221; from 
  the book, to those entries to my &#8220;7 Solutions&#8221; paper and this one 
  on Restorative<a name="Restorative"></a> Affirmative Action, has been open for 
  all to see. I offer it as an agenda for all local branches of the NAACP, for 
  they will not receive these kinds of ideas or this kind of encouragement from 
  the national NAACP. And that is also part of my great sadness, for a once pround 
  organization fighting for civil rights to turn its back on the prize and instead 
  focus its eye on its staff. 
<p><strong>17. College bands <a name="bands"></a>, newspapers, and sports: a different 
  kind of affirmative action.</strong> 
<p>There are two types of affirmative action programs in colleges and universities, 
  both undergraduate and graduate schools. One is based on merit. The other is 
  based on race without merit. Let us acknowledge the difference. All affirmative 
  action programs based on who can play in the band, write for the newspaper, 
  and play on the teams, are based on merit, as are legacy programs admitting 
  alumni offspring or offspring of big donors. How can anyone object to colleges 
  wanting the best musicians, writers and athletes they can get, as well as students, 
  including those offspring of donors? 
<p>That still doesn't address the now discredited affirmative action program, 
  a program I say should be focused on Blacks only as the "restoration affirmative 
  action&#8221; program, to jump start the long sabotaged program of redressing 
  the systematic holding back of Blacks in education, jobs and housing. If we 
  are serious, then we can follow Justice O'Connor's notion of needing it no more 
  than 25 years (if, and its a big if, the same is done for elementary schools) 
  and eventually doing away with what only Justice Thomas seems bold enough to 
  address, the stigmatizing of minorities as not being good enough (and that goes 
  for both "lead&#8221; minorities, Black men and women and White women). 
<p>The ruling of the Supreme Court again sets it off as an attempt to be the court 
  of all the people. It recognized that Affirmative Action has been blown by this 
  country and now needs to do it right. Lets join with the court and set as our 
  goal the achieving of that redress so that affirmative action will no longer 
  be necessary in 25 years. As Justice O'Connor stated, in her majority opinion, 
  that the ruling should be considered to have a time limit: &#8220;The Court 
  expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer 
  be necessary to further the interest approved today.&#8221; 
<p><strong>18. To repeat: restoration<a name="restoration"></a> is the central 
  key idea of affirmative action: redress and catch up, not diversity or multiculturalism, 
  the hijackers of the restoration goal of affirmative action.</strong> 
<p>The Supreme Court, essentially, agrees with my position, at least in theory, 
  when O'Connor writes that the court "expects&#8230;the use of <strong>racial 
  preferences</strong> will no longer be necessary&#8221; in 25 years. Note: racial. 
  <strong>Not</strong> gender, <strong>not</strong> sexual orientation, <strong>not</strong> 
  disabled, <strong>not</strong> religions, <strong>not</strong> ethnicities, 
  <strong>not</strong> cultures, <strong>not,</strong> in other words, any other 
  self-described victim group. The purpose of affirmative action is to remedy 
  past wrongs to the decendents of slaves, not further the new ideologies of diversity 
  or multiculturalism, neither of which right past wrongs. They are about social 
  evolution, a very different subject. 
<p>Note that "liberal&#8221; schools, especially elite ones, despite their self 
  righteous hand wringing favoring their version of affirmative action, have woefully 
  few Blacks on their faculties. But they too know how to play the game: they 
  too want federal funds ("who benefits?, remember). To get federal funds they 
  have to admit so many minorities (Blacks, Women, Hispanics, etc). There is no 
  requirement that they have to learn anything. We all know Blacks as well as 
  White women who were admitted, passed and graduated to keep those federal funds 
  coming and who took positive advantage of it by working hard and getting appropriately 
  credentialed just as we know those who took negative advantage of it and coasted 
  through (there are those who have no pride but are takers, who will skip a lot 
  of the work if they don&#8217;t have to do it to get their degree). And although 
  it is a lame and narrow question, it still makes a point: who do you want to 
  do your surgery or fly your plane: a person there for quota reasons who slacked 
  off or a person there because of their skill and character? Who will get promoted 
  over time: the person with the degree or the person who also has the knowledge 
  that the degree represents? These are not insignificant questions. The NAACP 
  would do us better by standing up for merit instead of quotas, and standing 
  up for change in the key to all of this: K-12 public education, especially K-6), 
  and work to make sure all students are up to grade level in terms of reading, 
  writing, and &#8216;rithmeticing. 
<p>Certainly, in Arthur Schlesinger Jr's apt phrase, we celebrate our movement 
  from exclusion in the 18th century to inclusion in the 20th and 21st centuries. 
  But to make it so it must be so in action, not just words. 
<p><strong>19. College And Affirmative Action: A Series Of Oxymorons<a name="Oxymorons"> 
  </a> About America's Culture And Diversity.</strong> 
<p>As noted above, colleges heavily engage in "affirmative action&#8221; for applicants 
  so that they can fill their athletic teams, fill their bands and orchestras, 
  man their newspapers and year books, have students for the theatres, and have 
  students that fit in with their particular academic specialties. All of this 
  is on merit. This is as it should be in a meritocratic society. Just be clear 
  that none of this has anything to do with race. The data shows that when students 
  are admitted to colleges with other students with similar high school grades 
  and SAT scores, the percentage of who do well is nearly identical among Whites 
  and Blacks. But when Blacks (or others) are jumped ahead into schools where 
  they, the Black students, don't match the others' high school grades or SAT 
  scores, they have a high failure rate. 
<p>The problem will solve itself when we restore education results and accountability 
  in the public schools producing the college applicants, graduating kids who 
  can go to college and those who want to go to grad school. 
<p>The goal I am calling for is to <strong>restore</strong> opportunity by allowing 
  a level playing field of the American dream for everyone. That is the historically 
  <strong>restorative</strong> action I affirm, so that leadership roles in all 
  institutions reflect the citizens of our society. Otherwise, the institutions 
  can't be said to be for all its citizens nor can one hold the fiction that there 
  is equal access and equal opportunity. <strong>If the institutions don't have 
  members statistically close to the population as a whole, it is significant 
  and means that there has been, up and down the education line, systematic discrimination 
  in the education system so as to prevent the underrepresented from being able 
  to qualify,</strong> or, once on the job, to prevent their advancement. Hence 
  the phrase by Martin Luther King, Jr., that although, especially in the inner 
  cities, Blacks are not qualified, they are qualifyable. But if true educators 
  were in charge, and not union backed posers (many are teaching subjects in K-12 
  they never majored in, nor mastered; there is a strange silence about the many 
  teachers who can't pass the qualifying test for their subjects, a problem that 
  will begin to reverse itself when we have teachers get advanced degrees in subjects 
  rather than methods), for then we could act on the truth of King's words, that 
  these unqualified inner city Blacks are still, nonetheless, <strong>qualifyable,</strong> 
  and that the goal should be to get them qualified, which they would be if they 
  were just given the appropriate education. 
<p>Quite often Whites in particular think all is OK. They need to get outside 
  the dominant White news papers and read the independent minority papers too. 
  I address this issue in my "Solution Papers&#8221; s section in <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/why.html">Why 
  American Cities Need Black Newspapers.</a> 
<p>I document my own experience in Chapter 7 of my book. What was done to me is 
  still being done to Black students. The Coleman study that showed Blacks did 
  better when sitting next to Whites in school was used to perpetuate negative 
  action: bus students and leave their neighborhoods segregated. The real issue 
  was that where there were Whites more money was spent on schools. Bussing was 
  one of the great social experiments with a hidden agenda: keep Blacks from progressing 
  so they would stay wards of a growing state bureaucracy and voters for the Democratic 
  Party. 
<p>These are the wrongs that <strong>Restorative</strong> Affirmative action is 
  meant to right, and those are the situations that we need to overcome by restoring 
  all institutions to reflect the society of which they are a part. And if education 
  was equal, they would. But as long as the Democratic Party gives control of 
  their education plank to the teachers unions who contribute heavily to their 
  re-election campaigns (which is like the fox bribing the farmer to be put in 
  charge of the hen house), their focus will remain their jobs and their health 
  care benefits and their retirement and their efforts to keep everything safe 
  and not rock the boat. Either the results of education for Blacks is on purpose 
  or the practitioners must be labeled failures for continuing the same teaching 
  methods as if doing the same things over and over would somehow provide different 
  results. Either way, they are culpable. New superintendents won't make much 
  difference, for the "action&#8221; is in the class room, and until teachers 
  colleges change too, there will be little impact in the class room. 
<p>The current debate over the Iraq war demonstrates the problem. Again, we all 
  can differ in how we feel Iraq should have been liberated. But now, after the 
  fact, we should be celebrating, regardless of whether our way was used or not 
  (mine was not). But the fiercest advocates of affirmative action based on diversity 
  and multiculturalism are also the biggest America haters. If liberty and freedom 
  and individualism are rooted in the culture of the West and thus of America, 
  then it means that all who come to America, as well as those born here, need 
  to stand on that common ground. 
<p>We must drop the fantasy of not judging other cultures and stop saying that 
  theirs, for whatever deluded reason, is better than ours (as the left used to 
  say in the 30s about the USSR or in the 50s about China or even now about Cuba). 
  I use the word oxymoron for those most opposed to the results of the War on 
  Terror, as they would be the first ones shot if they lived there with their 
  ideas, especially those who are pro-women, pro-gay, pro-everything else that 
  is anathema to the rulers of the Islamic states, and even more so if they are 
  actually women. 
<p> <strong>20. Repeal<a name="Repeal"></a>/Repudiate "Separate But Equal,&#8221; 
  Goldwater, and the Kerner Commission/Bell Curve Conclusion. </strong> 
<p>Slavery is separate <strong>and</strong> unequal. Segregation is separate <strong>and</strong> 
  unequal. Only integration provides an environment of equal access <strong>and</strong> 
  equal opportunity. The "separate and equal&#8221; resurrection of recent court 
  decisions is not progress. It is one more way to defer our dream and to prevent 
  restoration. If you want a suggestion for a litmus test from me for appointees 
  to the Supreme Court, that is the only one that matters. For all other litmus 
  tests are merely left and right wing propaganda. Only the law should count, 
  not its ideological interpretations based on the latest "current notion of equality.&#8221; 
  Separate but equal must be repudiated. 
<p>It is worth repeating about Barry Goldwater&#8217;s run for President on the 
  1964 Republican ticket as also being a run against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
  His basis: faulty reasoning regarding states rights grounds, which, although 
  literally correct, was historically incorrect as his view refused to either 
  acknowledge or judge that slavery violated the Declaration and the Constitution, 
  as did the Jim Crow laws, which were a defacto repudiation/repeal of the 13, 
  14, and 15th amendments. Until the Republican Party publicly acknowledges this 
  and apologizes for it, it will be very difficult for Blacks to trust them on 
  the issues of their civil rights, no matter how badly we are treated by the 
  Democrats. As stated earlier: Goldwater's stand must be repudiated and apologized 
  for. 
<p>Both the liberal 1968 <i>Kerner Commission Report </i>and the conservative 
  1998 book <i>The Bell Curve</i> arrived at the same conclusions for different 
  but similar reasons: that government has to take care of Blacks because they 
  can't on their own as they are different ("separate&#8221;). This notion that 
  we are different and dumber than the rest is not proven in either work or in 
  any other (and although Darwin thought so he never proved it), and thus both 
  must be repudiated. 
<p>Without repudiating/repealing these, Blacks will be other minorities' stepping 
  stones up the ladder of social mobility, as one more burden is placed on our 
  backs and once again we are kept in our place in favor of others. The inner 
  cities of American in general and that of Minneapolis in particular prove my 
  point. 
<p>Simply put, we need to assimilate everyone to achieve equality of access and 
  opportunity. A recent book, <i>Remaking the American Mainstream, </i> by Richard 
  D. Alba and Victor Nee, addresses this issue. This is the notion behind the 
  "melting pot,&#8221; as in the 1782 statement of the Frenchman J. Hector St. 
  John de Cevecoeur when he waxed poetically that in America, individuals from 
  different backgrounds "are melted into a new race of men.&#8221; To Alba and 
  nee, assimilation refers to the process by which different people from different 
  places come to see themselves as part of a new and larger family, if you will. 
  This is the process some call "Americanization.&#8221; And it has been what 
  has happened in most countries. But in the U.S., those in charge who have come 
  to not like their country call this coercion and cultural condescension and 
  oppose assimilation. They consider it wrong. Indeed, there was a point when 
  this movement was so strong in New York that there was a drive to make it a 
  bi-lingual English-Spanish state. Two things killed that. One was that there 
  were too many other second languages. The other was that self-appointed Spanish 
  leaders told newcomers under no circumstances were they to learn English. This 
  would have given them a locked up voting constituency they could then use to 
  bargain with the Democrats, except many of the newcomers wanted to be Americans 
  and many parents realized the folly of their kids not learning English. 
<p>What Alba and Nee suggest is a dynamic and nonlinear process where boundaries 
  blur and all shift one way when in the public square and another way when behind 
  closed doors or with people like those from where they came from. Ivory tower 
  ideological hopes aside, the truth is that, even with Mexican-Americans, the 
  pull of the new country is so strong that 60% of the children of the third or 
  later generations speak only English. America, dynamically always in a state 
  of change, is changed by each new group. Descendants of slaves need to be allowed 
  to work into the mainstream as every other group rather than being told they 
  are different and can't do so. 
<p><strong>21. Warning<a name="Warning"></a>: Recycling The Trojan Horse In The 
  Living Room: Blacks as Stepping Stones For More "Separate But Equal&#8221; Non-Black 
  Minorities To Keep Blacks in their Place Will Backfire. </strong> 
<p>The reason I continually call for seeking common ground (agreed upon YESes 
  and NOs, Chapter 5 of my book) and a spirit of reconciliation (Desmond Tutu's 
  "ubuntu philosophy of reconciliation,&#8221; my web log entries 163, 164, and 
  172) is because I don't see any other way to avoid recycling the 2nd half of 
  the twentieth century in which we as Blacks become simply stepping stones for 
  other minorities or special interests to use to advance ahead of us, continually 
  keeping inner city Blacks in their place. 
<p>The Constitution is like a broken plate that was dropped before it was ever 
  used, and continually gets dropped and reglued, and with each regluing getting 
  more chips and tiny holes. We need an adhesive to fill the chips and holes. 
  That adhesive is the Declaration of Independence and the first 15 amendments. 
  The Declaration of Independence provides us with "all men are created equal&#8221; 
  but left the Constitution incomplete and unhardened. The three Civil War Amendments 
  completed the Constitution and hardened the adhesive to fix the chips and fill 
  the holes. As noted above, the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the14th Amendment 
  extended citizenship to freed slaves and is known by its last five words: <strong>"equal 
  protection of the laws,&#8221;</strong> and the 15th Amendment protected the 
  right to vote against racial discrimination. They were ratified in 1865, 1868 
  and 1869 respectively. 
<p>The 14th Amendment nullified the infamous Dred Scott decision (see Interlude 
  6 of my book), which not only ratified the legality of slavery but allowed it 
  to be established in the new territories as well. Had history then stood at 
  that, new territories with slavery plus existing slave states would have outnumbered 
  the non-slave states, and would have then been in a position to dominate the 
  federal government and change the constitution to allow slavery in every state. 
  The North didn't want to be controlled by the South. Abolitionists didn't want 
  an extension of slavery. This was the backdrop of their joining forces leading 
  to the Civil War. 
<p>The 14th Amendment, faithful to the intent of the incomplete Constitution now 
  completed, properly set rights, both natural and civil, as something that referred 
  to individuals, not groups ("persons&#8221; is the word used). No where is the 
  word "race&#8221; used. 
<p>The Constitution was cracked again with the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision 
  and its infamous phrase "separate but equal&#8221; that legalized segregation 
  and reopened the &#8220;race based&#8221; interpretation of laws and the attendant 
  discrimination that always accompanies segregation. Justice Harland dissented 
  because the Declaration is color blind and thus the Constitution should be too. 
  This led the way to a good decision in 1954 for the wrong reasons that have 
  bedeviled the affirmative action debate ever since that 1954 <i>Brown v. Board 
  of Education</i> decision. It was made clear that segregated schools violated 
  the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. But its reasoning gave new life 
  to "separate but equal,&#8221; the situation we now see in the inner cities 
  of America. Bussing left us separate. 
<p>Chief Justice Warren also demoted the Constitution in favor of pop psychology 
  as he wrote that to separate school children "solely because of their race generates 
  a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect 
  their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to be undone&#8230;Whatever may have 
  been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>&#8230;this 
  finding is amply supported by modern authority,&#8221; the authority of psychology, 
  of all things, promoting feelings over the Constitution. Thus, they ruled, unless 
  it creates feelings of inferiority, racial classifications are OK. This was 
  in part what Martin Luther King, Jr. fought against when he called for judging 
  people by the content of their character not the color of their skin. Warren 
  opened the door for "affirmative action&#8221; as a restoring principle, but 
  based on class not individuals. Now any group claiming something hurts their 
  feelings bellies up to the bar of "gimme&#8221; to the government. 
<p>Thus the door was open for Blackmun, in <i>Regents v. Bakke</i>to rule (which 
  is the word I prefer to the Court's choice of word, "opinion&#8221;, as it had 
  the force of a dictate) to resurrect "separate but equal,&#8221; a sword that 
  can cut both ways. Blackmun wrote that "In order to get beyond racism, we must 
  first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some 
  persons equally, <strong>we must treat them differently.&#8221; Say what? Differently? 
  Not equally? That set the stage for opening the door of the Civil Rights Act 
  to any group with a grievance or claim of victim hood, creating a mass of free 
  riders</strong> which, when you include women as a "minority,&#8221; is well 
  over half the population. The 1964 Civil Rights Act rested on the concept of 
  merit and ability, not race or ethnicity. It was based on individuals. Regents 
  v. Bakke distorted it to a case on class, which also set up the trend for "special 
  interests&#8221; and "protected classes.&#8221; 
<p>This Pandora's box was opened by President Lyndon Johnson when he re-wrote 
  the Constitution by saying equal opportunity means equal results. The Democrats, 
  to their foolishness, have remained faithful to this as a vote getter ever since, 
  although the California recall vote suggests people are finally understanding 
  the toll it takes on their individual freedom, liberty, and prosperity in higher 
  taxes, more regulations, and lost jobs as a result. As I wrote in my book (Interlude 
  16, p. 299): 
<ul>
  Throughout, I have held that "equal opportunity&#8221; does not mean "equal 
  results.&#8221; That is foolish. Many think Lyndon Johnson's worst deed was 
  the Vietnam War. Certainly I was no fan of the war. It may not have been necessary. 
  It surely wasn't executed right. But as Gorbachev later said it helped bankrupt 
  the Soviet Union, we may have to begrudgingly admit it helped end the Cold War. 
  And his Great Society was well intended (we were all in favor of ending poverty 
  even as we disagreed on the means to do so). His worst deed was how he defined 
  the goal of the Great Society. The reason the Republicans were so horrified 
  by the Great Society is because they correctly interpreted his Left, Socialist 
  goal as being unintentionally totalitarian. The goal, as LBJ stated it, was: 
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnot just equality as a right and a theory 
    but equality as a fact and as a result. 
  <p>To achieve "equality of result&#8221; in terms of equal access and equal 
    opportunity is one thing. To expect, as many on the Left pushed for, equal 
    results as the redistribution of property and wealth. Whether LBJ meant this 
    or not is a moot question. The Left of the Democratic party does. But to do 
    so would require absolute state coercion at every level, including the redistribution 
    of private property, and telling everyone what they could become in society, 
    as if they were potted plants to place in a socially engineered garden, which 
    is the opposite of what most of us mean by freedom and liberty. This is why 
    some progressives, as much as they are leary of the Republicans, are just 
    as leary about the Democrats, for no one is repudiating this. 
  <ul>
    <p>Additional excerpts from Interlude 16 of my book, &#8220;Calculating A 
      Better Future For All&#8221;: 
    <ul>
      It is a beautiful, poetic statement albeit a wrong and deadly one&#8230;We 
      all know that human beings are, by nature, unequal, whether we are playing 
      in the Super Bowl or on Jeopardy. What I have been talking about is that 
      Blacks haven't been allowed to participate in the game&#8230; 
      <p>The political Right gives lip service to "equality of opportunity&#8221;&#8230; 
      <p>The political Left, on the other hand, gives lip service to "equality 
        of results,&#8221; for that policy clearly favors them and would give 
        them the great coercive power of the government to enforce it&#8230; 
      <p>&#8230;So the real issue for both the Right and Left, as I see it, is 
        power, not fairness or justice, even if the words "fairness&#8221; and 
        "justice&#8221; are used to justify the taking of freedoms and liberty. 
        But as we saw from Chapter 2, "law&#8221; by itself is not enough if it 
        isn't exercised equally: we want total impartiality in the application 
        of law. And as we have seen in Interlude 8, this has clearly and purposefully 
        been denied to Blacks. 
    </ul>
    <p>The "angry White male&#8221; has a point in that the <i>Regents v. Bakke</i> 
      said that because "whites as a class&#8221; need no protection, they have 
      "no standing&#8221; to challenge racial preferences in the law. Now, that 
      is just as discriminating and angering to Whites as it was to Blacks when 
      Blacks had no standing. Some think this was rejected in a 1995 decision, 
      and that it is its memory that haunts Whites wondering if this shoe could 
      be dropped again. But it was not rejected or reversed. It was merely narrowed, 
      by the decision of Justice Sandra Day O'Conner, because she said racial 
      classification had to be given "strict scrutiny&#8221; and is permitted 
      if there is a "compelling state interest.&#8221; 
    <p>The debate continues. There are White Democrats who consider Justice Thomas 
      a turn coat (as the only good Black is a Democrat). There are also Black 
      Democrats who consider him a turncoat as well (as they are true believers 
      that only Democrats will help Blacks, denying, as they do, the history of 
      the Democrats during slavery, during the Jim Crow period and post Kerner 
      in the inner cities). 
    <p>Justice Thomas wrote that based on the Declaration, there is a "moral [and] 
      constitutional equivalence between laws designed to subjugate a race and 
      those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some 
      current notion of equality.&#8221; And it's the "current notion&#8221; that 
      gets us into trouble. As W.R. Inge is said to have remarked, he would marry 
      the spirit of the age soon finds himself a widower. In other words, many 
      ideas don't stand the test of time although they can certainly test the 
      time. 
    <p>And that is why using a class such as race, rather than the individual, 
      creates a Trojan Horse, as it is used to dilute the restoration intended 
      by affirmative action for the descendents of slaves. It undermines Blacks 
      and it undermines democracy. As I write in Chapter 14: 
    <ul>
      A major change in the 1980s came when civil rights was no longer interpreted 
      in terms of race, which was to enable Blacks to better play catch-up after 
      300 years of slavery but instead began to be defined in terms of victim 
      groups based on gender and sexual orientation. Thus, the Civil Rights Commission, 
      which was traditionally against racial discrimination, is no longer about 
      civil rights as that term was traditionally defined. It is now open to all 
      kinds of new groups, now called "protected classes,&#8221; which includes 
      not only those of gender and sexual orientation, but the physically challenged 
      (who used to be classified as "handicapped&#8221;). 
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not opposed to these groups working out how to obtain their rights 
      as well, but it is not the same thing. The key is that most of these groups 
      are White, which defeats and ignores the original purpose. </p>
    <p>This became the new "current notion of equality&#8221; that has become 
      the spirit of the age. And now, in California, the latest "current notion 
      of equality&#8221; is illegals being granted citizenship or the equivalent 
      of it by letting them go on social services rolls, collect welfare, get 
      educated, get mortgages, get drivers licenses, all at tax payer expenses, 
      adding one more kept dependent group to vote for Democrats and one more 
      group to jump to the head of the line ahead of us. Why not work out with 
      Mexico the granting of work permits that lets them come, work (begin, perhaps, 
      in agriculture), and return home. It would benefit them, us, homeland security, 
      and the tax payers pocket, while keeping clear that even this kind of proposed 
      &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; for illegals again defers the descendents 
      of the American slave an creates a wedge between Blacks and Hispanics. 
    <p>This will only get worse because of the Michigan Cases of 2003. Please 
      note: we still need <strong>restorative affirmative action</strong> for 
      the descendents of American's slaves, but not for newcomers or any other 
      self-described victims group at the expense of the restoration for the descendants 
      of slaves. We are again told to wait. Martin Luther King, Jr. explained 
      this in his book by the title of <strong> Why We Can't Wait.</strong> Why 
      self-appointed Black leaders in Minneapolis have bought into this "spirit 
      of the age&#8221; saying it will take generations should shock the community 
      out of its lethargy. Sadly, to date, it has not. 
    <p>The "compelling state interest&#8221; suggested by Justice O'Connor was 
      the need to promote diversity through racial preferences, which means that 
      as more and more different groups immigrate to this country, they too will 
      be asking for the same kind of protected class status and all the goodies 
      that go with it, again deferring our dream. The Democrats continue to pander 
      to new arriving groups for their votes and the Republicans stand by and 
      let them and we, again, pay the price. The notion of some that because this 
      was for an educational institution it will be limited to educational institutions 
      shows that they have their heads in the sand and certainly don&#8217;t have 
      their fingers on the political pulse. 
    <p>Who would have guessed I would be quoting Justice Thomas again, but who 
      else is there standing up for Blacks in this? He dissented from majority 
      decision saying that "the Constitution abhors classifications based on race&#8230;because 
      every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes 
      race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.&#8221; 
    <p>That is why I have framed my <strong>restorative affirmative action</strong> 
      not on race but on injustice, on the historical reality of what this country 
      has done to Blacks through 200 years of slavery, 88 years of Jim Crow and 
      38 years of Kerner Commission nonsense treating us on the basis that we 
      can't that we can't make it on our own. 
    <p>Given the expansion of civil rights to new special interest groups and 
      protected classes groups, of which illegal immigrants is but the latest, 
      surely Justice Thomas speaks for us when he wrote in his dissent that the 
      Michigan decision "has placed its imprimatur on a practice that can only 
      weaken the principle of equality embodied in the Declaration of Independence 
      and the Equal Protection Clause&#8221; of the 14th Amendment. 
    <p>If this continues, diluting more and more the significance of the Black 
      contributions to this country over the past 400 years, we will be kept in 
      our place again by the Democrats in the Trojan Horse of what I can only 
      call "non-restorative affirmative action.&#8221; The first step to restoration 
      is to provide equal education in K-12, which is where the true restoration 
      is, for then we won't need affirmative action quotas in higher education. 
    <p><strong>22. Conclusion: Focus On The prize<a name="prize"></a>, Not The 
      Prize Keepers, As We Address Four Wars On 4 Fronts: The War On Poverty And 
      Access/Opportunity, The War On Drugs, The War On Terrorism, And, in a Word: 
      "The War On The Weak.&#8221;</strong> 
    <p>It may seem strange to end this paper with a section title with "The War 
      on&#8221; phrase four times. My purpose is to remind us to learn the lessons 
      of history, so we don't get taken in by what Edwin Black in The War On The 
      Weak calls sham science, fake science, and fake academics, the American 
      experience of intellectuals trying to keep Blacks down and justifying why 
      they should be sterilized to prevent their reproduction. His book is subtitled, 
      <i>America's Crusade To Create A Master Race. </i> It is about the eugenics 
      movement (the idea of manipulating human genes to improve individuals, groups 
      or entire populations, and has been used to investigate diseases as well 
      as for the political purposes of sterilization, euthanasia and genocide) 
      in this country in the early part of this century, a movement funded by 
      some of the great foundations, a movement that achieved getting eugenics 
      laws passed in 27 states, laws that allowed those deemed inferior to be 
      sterilized: the weak, the imbeciles, the seemingly incompetent. 
    <p>In reality, the categories were White hillbillies, Blacks, and immigrants 
      from eastern and southern Europe. It was America's attempt at ethnic cleansing, 
      under the umbrella of the highest "authority,&#8221; science, and a 1927 
      Supreme Court decision, which said eugenics laws were constitutional as, 
      in the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, "three generations of imbeciles 
      is enough&#8221; (this too was later repealed). The movement was pioneered 
      in the U.S. and spread to Europe and elsewhere. 
    <p>In his book <i>Mein Kampf, </i> Adolph Hitler praised America's sterilization 
      laws and immigration restrictions. Hitler used eugenics to base his "final 
      solution&#8221; of liquidating Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, the retarded, 
      and the handicapped. The movement is now called human genetics and seeks 
      to fight disease. We need to make sure that's all it does. But the movement 
      is consistent with what Darwin said. Darwin, in his book &#8220;Descent 
      of Man,&#8221; referred to Africans and Aboriginal Australians as &#8220;savages&#8221; 
      and stated: 
    <ul>
      &#8220;Civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace 
      the savage races throughout the world&#8230;The break between man and his 
      nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in 
      a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some 
      ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian 
      and the gorilla.&#8221; 
    </ul>
    <p>This concept influenced the Dred Scott Case, 1856, which stated slaves 
    <ul>
      &#8220;had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an 
      inferior order&#8230;so far inferior, that they had no rights which the 
      white man was bound to respect; and that the Negro might justly and lawfully 
      be reduced to slavery for his benefit.&#8221; 
    </ul>
    <p>The American Constitution says men are created equal in the eyes of God. 
      Harry S Truman stated in his Inaugural Address, 1949: &#8220;We believe 
      that all men are created equal, because they are created in the image of 
      God.&#8221; This drives home the centrality of the contest between the concept 
      of separation of church and state, for if it is interpreted <strong>(1)</strong> 
      as meaning there is no God, and so men are not only not &#8220;created,&#8221; 
      they are not &#8220;equal,&#8221; just as Darwin espoused above, and <strong>(2)</strong> 
      as meaning Christianity should be removed from the public square (remember 
      the 1st amendment states "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
      of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&#8221; (with the second 
      half conveniently discarded), then <strong>(3)</strong> what is all the 
      fuss about equal access and equal opportunity, equal education and jobs/housing, 
      as Darwin and the southern slavers would have to be given their due to it 
      would have to be given to Hobbes and let the powerful prevail. 
    <p>Here again we see the influence of the rulings allowing classification 
      by groups as opposed to dealing with individuals, and listening to those 
      whose groups who are offended, in this case, the secular left). And remember 
      Marx, for all of his voluminous writings, dismissed Africa in the only two 
      paragraphs he used to write about it. 
    <p>As the two Michaels show in their quotes at the beginning of this paper, 
      this will not be an easy task. But with vision and perseverance, it can 
      be done, now as opposed to later. Martin Luther King, Jr., acknowledged 
      this when he said that although there were Blacks who were not qualified, 
      they were <strong>qualifyable</strong> through training and working up to 
      it. Needed is to get young Black men qualified by whatever training is necessary, 
      including adding technical or vocational tracks to schools rather than the 
      current college only preparatory curriculum that is not appropriate for 
      all students (and certainly not for the 2/3 who start and don't finish). 
    <p>This is what the NAACP should be fighting for, not working to dine with 
      dictators in foreign nations, as if dictators dining with them will change 
      their systems. It is time for the NAACP to again focus its eyes on the prize 
      at home. 
    <p>In my Solution Paper on the NAACP posted on my web site, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/eyeoffprize.htm"> 
      NAACP Takes Eye Off Prize,</a> I approvingly quoted both George Bush and 
      Tony Blair. I want to close here by quoting Bill Clinton. Clearly, on the 
      world stage of the past decade, these are the three giants (Clinton, Blair, 
      Bush) able to wear seven league boots in a world populated by "the mini-minded 
      mini-men of mini-ville&#8221; politics. This is from Clinton's statement 
      on the War in Iraq, made July 23, 2003. I quote it because it discusses 
      the one thing we need to remember: <strong>to find the common ground on 
      which all of us Americans as citizens of a great nation can stand together.</strong> 
      We don't have to agree on the how. But we should be clear on the what. And 
      the what, is, liberty and freedom for all, equal access and equal opportunity 
      for all, and if these concepts mean anything, then they are for the world, 
      not just the U.S. They are for the entire rainbow of people, not just Whites, 
      they are for all members of the human race, and they are for "all God's 
      chillun.&#8221; 
    <p>As a descendent of slaves and of Native Americans, I can assure you, my 
      dear readers, that there is a great deal of difference between the negative 
      slant the press is giving the war on terror, as if we were a colonial power, 
      when in reality we should be proud of being liberators and that the opposition 
      that is left is not a nation's defenders but rather the dead-ending remnants 
      of a totalitarian regime and their Al Queda compatriots. Clinton gets it 
      right. Lets apply what he says to civil rights and finally bring an end 
      to the current farce of affirmative action, reestablish it for what it was 
      intended for, <strong>Restorative</strong> Affirmative action, and work 
      to make sure it is no longer needed, for anyone, in any group, within 25 
      years. Here is what he said. 
    <ul>
      We should be pulling for America on this. We should be pulling for the people 
      of Iraq. We can have honest disagreements about where we go from here, and 
      we have space now to discuss that in what I hope will be a nonpartisan and 
      open way. But this State of the Union deal they decided to use the British 
      intelligence. The president said it was British intelligence. Then they 
      said on balance they shouldn&#8217;t have done it. You know, everybody makes 
      mistakes when they are president. I mean, you can&#8217;t make as many calls 
      as you have to make without messing up once in awhile. The thing we ought 
      to be focused on is what is the right thing to do now. 
    </ul>
    <p>Note: he also said that "it is incontestable that on the day I left office, 
      there were unaccounted-for stocks of biological and chemical weapons&#8221; 
      in Iraq. 
    <p>We need to come together in America, and link the freeing of peoples everywhere 
      with the final act of freeing our own inner city people in the United States. 
    <p>It was important to free them. It is important to free ourselves. Lets 
      make the call for civil rights, for democracy for the world, and for liberty 
      and freedom for all our people and all peoples of the world. 
    <p>I agree with Black scholar Thomas Sowell who has called for a new contract 
      with Black America, especially in terms of education (including offering 
      school choice), avoiding the environmental extremism that causes affordable 
      housing and businesses to be impossible due to myths about species protection, 
      and his call to better sustain public safety through crime control, and 
      offer real hope of racial progress as well as prosperity progress. 
    <p>My <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html">Seven 
      Solutions</a> paper was been written to add to the discussion. Its full 
      title bears repeating: <strong>"7 Key Themes, 7 Key Problems, And 7 Key 
      Solutions For Solving The Problems Of America&#8217;s Inner Cities In Order 
      To Stop Deferring The Dream And To Actualize It&#8221;.</strong> A group 
      often ignored by the White community that should be a prominent part of 
      the discussion is the Black press, as I note in my paper <a href=05whynewspapers.htm https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/why.html">Why 
      American Cities Need Black Newspapers.</a> To remind us that we have a deep 
      well to draw from to enable us to stay positive in working together to find 
      that common ground for progress, we will do was have always done, as expessed 
      in my <a href=04enduremusic.htm>Enduring Through Music: Here, There, and 
      Everywhere</a> paper. 
    <p>Lets acknowledge our mistakes, which we'll make, and let us pledge, commit 
      and promise to always focus on doing the right thing. For me that means 
      working from the list of YESes and NOs of Chapter 5. We all know, in our 
      hearts as Americans, what that the right thing is and the right thing starts 
      with education and then moves on to jobs and then to housing. So let's start 
      by developing a set of Sullivan Principles for our city (see my Chapter 
      14). Lets start by following my "7 Solutions&#8221; piece in the "Solution 
      Papers&#8221; section of my web site. Let's follow Nellie Stone Johnson 
      rallying cries: "no education, no job, no housing&#8221; and "no education, 
      no jobs, no hope.&#8221; Bring in the clichs. They work: Let's make them 
      happen. Let's do it. Let's overcome. Let's realize the dream. Let's bring 
      it on. Let&#8217;s roll. 
    <p>Now let's all gather together and fling the freedom gates open wide and 
      lead everyone through them. Why? Because, going back to the question "who 
      benefits?&#8221;, we all do. Thus it all boils down to what values and vision 
      we want to support. I close with the close of my book that summarizes this 
      sense of values and vision: 
    <p> 
    <ul>
      Viktor Frankl ended his book <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> in this way: 
    </ul>
    <p> 
    <ul>
      So, let us be alert--alert in a twofold sense: 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSince Hiroshima we know what is at stake. 
      </ul>
      <p> And so, the Minneapolis story calls us to be alert in a twofold sense 
        as well: 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        Since slavery, Jim Crow, Tulsa, Rosewood, Duluth,<br>
        Hollman and August 2002 in Minneapolis,<br>
        and the racism, violence, and White terrorism <br>
        described in Interludes 2, 6, 9-15, we know what man is capable of. 
        <p> Since the Civil War, Dred Scott, Martin Luther King, Jr., <br>
          the land-takings and wealth-takings from Blacks,<br>
          the attempts to bring Jim Crow back and the current problems in the 
          inner cities <br>
          in terms of education, housing, jobs, and equal access/opportunity, 
          <br>
          the Watts Riots of 1965, the urban riots of 1967, and the latest unrest 
          in Minneapolis in 2002, we know what is at stake.      </p>
      </ul>
