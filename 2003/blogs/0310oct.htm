<p><strong>Blog #210. November 1, 2003: NAACP Fraud and deception is creating 
  a credibility gap, a back lash, and questions. Would that it would create shame 
  and acts of conscience. </strong></p>
<p>When the NAACP cancelled it meeting for Saturday the 25th (against the rules, 
  despite their “cover” that they’ve done it before, which is an admission that 
  they don’t follow their own rules), their credibility took another big hit. 
  Remember, with nearly 100,000 Blacks in Minneapolis and the local branch NAACP 
  current membership roll under 400, their credibility is already at a low. Now 
  they want put in jeopardy their big annual fund raising banquet, to be held 
  next month, and which was to feature Danny Glover. But the last 4-5 years the 
  NAACP has experienced a steady decline. They have gotten through the last 4-5 
  years because The St. Paul Companies, Norwest Bank now Wells Fargo, have been 
  underwriting the dinner. Last year they had a total of 199 people at the dinner. 
  When they stole the election in November 2002, patting themselves on the back 
  for having defeated the notorious Ron Edwards, they believed the White community 
  would reward them for defeating the notorious Ron Edwards, the community, instead, 
  did not turn out. </p>
<p>So look how far and how fast they the NAACP has fallen: in the year 2000, I 
  helped bring Nelson Mandela here, through my relationship with Archbishop Desmond 
  Tutu, who was initially our speaker but fell ill (and after I contacted Tutu’s 
  daughter, he arranged to have Nelson Mandela take his place), we had 2,000 people 
  in attendance. Think of it, 2,000 in 2000, and 200 in 2002. That is a disaster. 
  In 2000, by the way, the local NAACP cleared $75,000. Also note this: the local 
  NAACP has not given a financial report for the last two dinners, 2001 and 2002. 
</p>
<p>This is a sign of terrible stewardship, destruction of a legacy, and receiving 
  a huge vote of no confidence from the community. In 2000, The St Paul Companies 
  picked up 70%, Wells Fargo 30%. The companies were so elated they held a breakfast 
  the following morning for Mandela at The St. Paul Club and gave him a check 
  for $100,000 to help with the Robins Island Restoration Project, which is creating 
  a museum at the site of where he was imprisoned for 28 years for opposing Apartheid. 
  In the past, White companies would buy tickets and give them to their Black 
  employees. Not this time. The Whites came to hear Nelson Mandela. Black employees 
  couldn’t get tickets. We were packed with White folks. </p>
<p>And how did the local NAACP handle this great breakthrough? They squandered. 
  Thinking they were on a new gravy train and a new day had dawned, they geared 
  up for the good life. And let us and the organization down. How can others be 
  expected to respect us when the local NAACP leadership offers no respect. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #209. October 31, 2003: Speaking truth to power and going against 
  the hegemony of the status quo and its power issues. This is not a Black and 
  White issue, it is a citizen&#8217;s issue. </strong></p>
<p>As the local NAACP has gone into its tailspin, many people come up to me and 
  say wow, everything you talked about in your book they are doing, and then they 
  ask, “how can they justify throwing you out?” And of course the answer is the 
  same one they bitterly complain about when Whites do it: because they can. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #208. October 30, 2003: The musical chairs of real and imagined 
  black mail: The NAACP is like a bunch of gun fighting black mailers standing 
  in a circle, each one with a gun to the head of the next person. </strong></p>
<p>In the popular TV cable re-runs of Perry Mason, the shows always deal with 
  a murder. In many, black-mail is involved: some one has something on another, 
  sometimes criminal behavior but most of the time embarrassing behavior. And 
  then when every week Perry gets his client off by getting the real murderer 
  to confess, the confession most of the time includes “I had to because,” and 
  many time with “and I’d do it again.” This is what the NAACP reminds me of. 
</p>
<p>The national NAACP has proof that the November 2002 election was stolen, that 
  the process was run fraudulently, that it was directed by their regional director, 
  a church minister for the one elected, his lover, with knowledge, abetting and 
  collusion of staff in the national office. So why aren’t these perpetrators 
  fired? Why isn’t action taken against them? Why is the one expelled the one 
  who has exercised his first amendment rights and the only action of the NAACP 
  to try to deny my first amendment rights? What other conclusion can there be 
  that the election had to be stolen to prevent an honest man a look at the financial 
  records which have now all been disposed of? We can only conclude that they 
  have been the corrupt hand maidens of the Democratic/DFL Parties for so long 
  that such corruption has come to be seen as normal to them. They obviously all 
  have been given a taste of the monies. And they have all sat around over time 
  raising their glasses and clinking them together in satisfaction of how well 
  they can play the White man’s money game. </p>
<p>They are so drunk on the wine of poison and nullification that they don’t have 
  a clue as to the damage they are doing to both the reputation of the NAACP, 
  to how this will effect people and organizations’ willingness to fund them in 
  the future, and their credibility in saying they speak for the descendents of 
  America&#8217;s slaves. With everyone having something on everyone else, they are 
  paralyzed. By serving themselves they have disserved not only the many who came 
  before them and handed them this great organization, but all those in the future 
  who now won’t be served because of how they have failed to live by the organization’s 
  principles and serve only themselves, all because they have they have taken 
  their eye off the prize, as I explain in my paper, <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye Off Prize</a>. </p>
<p>They are so eager to punish “Boss Edwards” that they are willing to cut off 
  their noses to spite their faces. They know the elections were tampered with 
  which should be enough to make heads roll, and they know their married regional 
  director was having an affair with the woman running for President that he showed 
  them how to steal the election for. That raises two other questions. First, 
  how many other local branches across this great country are being tutored in 
  Fraud and Malfeasance 101? And secondly, how can the President of the NAACP 
  exert moral authority regarding our inner city young men and women when he has 
  tom catted with the best of the brothers, having sired six children with five 
  different women? <br />

<p><strong>Blog #207. October 29, 2003: The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes: 
  40 years of work and synthesis of experience combined with two years of additional 
  thought and synthesis with a researcher and editor. </strong></p>
<p>Some have asked me how I can continue a daily web log when topics as serious 
  as these require study and reflection, not instant thought without rethought. 
  Others have asked me how I could work with a White editor about the Black experience. 
  These are good questions, as far as they go, but reflect more a lack of thinking 
  on the questioners than about the writing. This is serious, but its not instant. 
  40 years of experience have gone into this followed by a year of writing the 
  book and a second year working with that product as the prism for the daily 
  web log. The simple truth that I’ve learned in 40 plus years as a community 
  activist and advocate is that the truth will indeed set you free. It is also 
  easier on the memory. Blogging is here to stay. Most are by serious people who 
  have thought a lot before entering the Blog world. Unlike those who must come 
  up with quick statements on new events daily, this Blog is very simple. There 
  are only two topics that are discussed (equal access and equal opportunity for 
  all) such that all receive an invitation to the table of society. These two 
  topics are broken down into seven areas: (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, 
  (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics. All 
  of these in turn are based on the foundational grounding of the book, The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes. Finally, all of this is distilled down into one word: 
  gap. </p>
<p>No matter how you slice and dice it, minorities in the inner city are taking 
  it in the shorts in these areas. If the gaps were for suburban Whites they would 
  be narrowed almost immediately. To call for waiting several generations is worse 
  than a cop out. It is a denial of the human spirit in general and a dismissal 
  of the spirit of freedom and liberty that beats in the heart of all people, 
  especially the oppressed who want out from under oppression like inner city 
  residents concentrated in impact areas with barriers to depart, the biggest 
  one being a good education, as seen the most by the young Black men with no 
  place to go, poorly educated, no jobs, no hope (see my State of Emergency for 
  Black Youth). </p>
<p>As for the White editor, I merely say what I’ve said before: 2 + 2 = 4 isn’t 
  White. Gravity isn’t White. Learning isn’t White. Slavery isn’t Black. Oppression 
  isn’t Black. Jim Crow isn’t Black. The same is true of everything: the minute 
  we say it has to be White (as many Whites do) or Black (as many Blacks do), 
  we have lost our way. He has been asked the same question, being told by White 
  friends in Minneapolis that he must have lost all of his self esteem, and that 
  he is bottom feeding, because he is working with Blacks. So there is room for 
  work and repair and reconciliation on both sides of the aisle. There is no Black 
  or White in “equal access and equal opportunity,” only human yearnings to be 
  free. There is no Black or White in being invited to the table, only justice 
  and fairness. </p>
<p>Once we get past these, then we can deal directly and solve the problems, which 
  to purposefully repeat, I address in terms of the gaps between Blacks and Whites: 
  (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, 
  (6) governing, and (7) ethics. I invite all to read my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper. The solutions are not liberal or conservative, 
  Republican or Democrat, Black or White. They are justice and fairness, aimed 
  at providing everyone with a place at the table, be it at the head or the foot 
  or the side of the table, the placement to be determined by common ground rules: 
  equal access and equal opportunity, and then, as they say in sports, may the 
  best man (or woman) win (as long as all can still sit somewhere at the table). 
</p>
<p>For those needing more background in why these exists, the historical consistency 
  of deferring Blacks their freedom and a way to restore justice and fairness 
  to achieve equal access and equal opportunity, read my <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action </a> paper. <br />

<p><strong>Blog #206. October 28, 2003: Message to the Corporate Community: Don’t 
  Lose Faith. I’m still bullish on Minneapolis. We shall make it. We shall overcome. 
  We shall have peace. Tell outsiders to come, invest, create jobs, and make money. 
  </strong></p>
<p>The unrest over the past year, and especially that over the past month in terms 
  of clashes between misperceptions by Black and White as to what the others’ 
  agenda is, is causing some to wonder whether they can invest in Minnesota, what 
  is the problem here, etc. Just know this: this is a great place to invest. The 
  attempt by RT Rybak and the Strib to shape the agenda and response of the Black 
  community should be given no moment. Their attempt to set up Don Samuels as 
  the spokesman is as big a failure as all other prior attempts with others. </p>
<p>Neither the Mayor nor the Strib nor Don, who refer to us as “they” (another 
  word used is to call us “Negroes”) are really not in touch with the community 
  other than superficially, and therefore these three have a far greater pessimistic 
  attitude than do we Blacks in the community. The Strib piece on the Jordan neighborhood 
  was hollow and almost schizophenic, saying on the one hand things were getting 
  better but on the other they were not. In Grow’s column he admitted that he 
  and Samuels are scared. We are not. They are not willing to stand up for our 
  community. We are. We know the potential. We know what can be done. I believe 
  the outline of recommended suggestions in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece reflects what should be considered. </p>
<p>We yearn for someone the mayor and the Strib will listen to that will grab 
  both by the scruff of their necks and tell them to quick fighting in our sand 
  box and cooperate with the other kids. There is a solution. Its is outlined 
  in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper, posted August 31, 2003, which I open up by stating: 
</p>
<ul>
  Neither this [7 Solutions] paper, nor my book [The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes], is about how bad Minneapolis is. It is about how it can be better. 
  Read p. 262, para. 1 &#8220;Society needs visionaries&#8221;) through para. 
  7 on p. 263 (&#8221;Thus, there are two Golden Triangles&#8221;). Minneapolis 
  is a wonderful city. Much progress in race relations has been made (Interludes 
  5 and 7). Yet there is still much to do (Interludes 2 and 10): it is the work 
  to be done to bring about equal access and equal opportunity in education, housing, 
  political participation, entrepreneurial growth, into the social/economic/political 
  mainstream. And, of course, facts are facts. My goal is to contribute to the 
  reversing of current and disturbing trend lines as discussed on p. 115 of Chapter 
  6 of &#8220;The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.&#8221; Nonetheless, as I 
  say on p. 294: &#8220;I am bullish on Minneapolis.&#8221; Nonetheless, &#8220;I 
  will keep my eye on the prize of freedom&#8221; and &#8220;I will continue to 
  beat the drum of freedom&#8221; (Chapters 5 and 17). 
  <p>The future is important. It is, as the old saying goes, where we will spend 
    the rest of our lives. The Star Tribune ran a series in 2000 on &#8220;Minnesota&#8217;s 
    greatest challenge: whether to compete or retreat in the face of a new economy&#8221; 
    [links are provided in the 7 Solutions piece]. I vote compete. That is what 
    these solutions are all about. Not following them is about retreat. As the 
    Strib pointed out, &#8220;The thrust of our argument is that global and technological 
    forces are speeding the rearrangement of capital and talent, sorting out metropolitan 
    regions into winners and losers.&#8221; Our problem? &#8220;Complacency.&#8221; 
    The writer states &#8220;The Twin Cities&#8230;has been coasting&#8230;in 
    part because of a smothering cultural contentment&#8230;[that] will only guarantee 
    further slippage unless a community-wide efforts is begun to rekindle the 
    flame that, in the 1950s and 1960s, led to an extraordinary burst of civic 
    energy.&#8221; That is what these 7 solutions are all about: trying to foster 
    a burst of civic energy, for all. </p>
</ul>
<p>Strib head hunting tactics are setting up a prolonged seige of nastiness for 
  the future, of wedging groups and races rather than helping to reconcile them, 
  which is why I have stressed the ubuntu concept of reconciliation used in South 
  Africa to reconcile the oppressed Blacks with the oppressor Whites after apartheid 
  (see my web log entries #163, 164, 172). We can&#8217;t escape the negatives of the 
  past, most of which none of us caused (see my <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a> piece posted a week ago) but we can shape a 
  positive future which we can escape and which we have to accept responsibility 
  for (hence my book and my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece, all produced for the purpose of helping Blacks 
  and Whites together work to complete the Unfinished Dream , especially as it 
  relates to solving the public safety issues in our community as it relates to 
  the State of Emergency for Black Youth . </p>
<p>Recent newspaper stories regarding Black leaders have included their past histories 
  regarding run ins with the law (whether they inhaled or not, whether they served 
  time, or had other problems). This, I’m sad to say, is against the spirit of 
  reconciliation. This is looking forward through the rear view mirror. Not helpful. 
  It is the politics of personal assassination. It now means that any who will 
  be nominated for, say the Superintendent of Schools, will have a microscope 
  attached to their lives. Who wants that? Surely the mediocre and poor candidates 
  will have few problems in their past. </p>
<p>The past is past. Again, we may deny responsibility for the past but we can&#8217;t 
  for the future. What happened to reconciliation, to “let he who is without sin 
  cast the first stone?” People change and transform. Too many in both communities 
  now want to allow for that only in &#8220;their&#8221; people but not for &#8220;the others.&#8221; 
  Surely Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger (not to mention 
  JFK and MLK, Jr.) have laid aside those considerations about the past for both 
  parties, allowing for the ideal no matter the personal stumbling, so any can 
  concentrate on the pragmatic “what will work.” We see in the 7 Solutions paper 
  that in the areas of : (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, 
  (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics, some of what has been done 
  has not worked. What hasn&#8217;t worked and what might should now be our focus, that 
  and who can do what will work, regardless of whether they are Black or White, 
  male or female, Ph.D. or not Ph.D., etc. It starts with education. As Nellie 
  Stone Johnson used to say, &#8220;no education, no jobs, no housing&#8221; and &#8220;no education, 
  no jobs, no hope.&#8221; As part of the subtitle of my book chapter on education states, &#8220;Stop the Clubbing and Teach Skills, Optimism, and Hope.&#8221; That is my hope. That 
  is the essence of providing the kind of community foundation we all want in 
  the seven areas. Who does it doesn&#8217;t matter. That we do it or don&#8217;t do it does.

<p><strong>Blog #205. October 28, 2003: It takes two to tango: it takes the private 
  and pubic sector, working together to create equal access and equal opportunity</strong></p>
<p>It can be done if both sides reconcile and find the common ground on which 
  to work together. Example: Atlanta. Maynard Jackson was Atlanta’s first Black 
  mayor. The October 3, 2003 USA Today, p. 3A, reports that Maynard Jackson “pioneered 
  the city’s affirmative action program, which forced city contactors to take 
  on minority and female partners. The program became a national model and created 
  a generation of black and female wealth.” When he became mayor, White contractors 
  were getting 99.88% of city contracts. As Mayor, Maynard Jackson worked to close 
  the gap. Blacks went from .12% to 34% before being cut back by court order to 
  20 some percent. It is this compliance that is missing by the city of Minneapolis, 
  as I discuss in Chapter 9 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.” 
  If we work together, we can make it happen here too, to the tremendous benefit 
  of Minneapolis just as it became a tremendous benefit for Atlanta. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #204. October 27, 2003: Tracing the Arc of Freedom for the descendents 
  of America’s slaves: new Solution Paper is loaded and working: “Restorative 
  Affirmative Action&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The trouble with the <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a> paper has been fixed. It traces the Arc of Freedom 
  for the descendents of America’s slaves and calls for the application of affirmative 
  action programs to the descendents of America’s slaves, and calls for ending 
  the process of expanding civil rights as it relates to the descendents of America’s 
  slaves so they can play “catch-up” without all kinds free riders being enabled 
  to push Black descendents of slaves back inside a new ghetto.</p>

<p><strong>Blog Blog #203. October 25, 2003: Where is the White ecumenical community? 
  </strong></p>
<p>The White Christian church, especially the Baptists, pride themselves on their 
  “born again” moments of transformation, what Luther called “daily dying and 
  rising,” of daily tempations such that for each of us there is a &#8220;daily putting 
  to death the old Adam” so that we can be transformed again, daily, born again, 
  pausing to remember whatever higher power we acknowledge. This is Lutheran country. 
  Why are they not heard from? White ministers gave credibility to the civil rights 
  marches in the 60s. Where are they today? They have radio and TV shows and newspapers 
  and magazines. Why are they not standing up as a moral conscience regarding 
  what this city is doing to minorities to cause and then prevent the gaps from 
  closing in the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> areas of : (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) 
  public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics. With the 
  Marches scheduled and with many in both the White and Black churches deploring 
  the violence of war and who marched against the war on Iraq, why don’t they 
  march against the war on young Black men in our communities? Why don’t both 
  of them remind their followers of the non-violent message of King and Ghandi, 
  or is OK in their White eyes to have a little violence if it’s just on Blacks? 
  Does the old saying “their silence condemns them” hold true? Indeed, in my TV 
  program on Sunday, October 12, I asked why the White ecumenical community has 
  remained silent. The only response I “hear” is their continued silence. Are 
  they silent as an affirmation of my column comment this past week: City Hall 
  is Vacant, Civil Rights are Dead, and the Mayor Has Left the Building, or can 
  they only get angry if its against Republicans or the Bush administration? </p>
<p>And before anyone has a hissy fit, please know that such terms as “born again” 
  are not the province of fundamentalists nor outside the purview of sophisticates. 
  Just as the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt laments the fact that “forgiveness 
  and reconciliation” have been ignored by those who don’t want to part of anything 
  Christian (because what is said and done is irreversible, there can be no peace 
  if sides, individuals to countries, can’t forgive and reconcile, which is why 
  she sees it as part of the need of the human condition, regardless of religion 
  or lack thereof, along with keeping promises, as promise keeping keeps chaos 
  at bay). Wouldn’t it be wonderful in Minneapolis, if the Lutherans would call 
  for creating in Minneapolis a &#8220;Kingdom of God&#8221; not as some fortress to hide 
  from secularism (or collude with it) but rather to use the concept for society 
  the same way as individuals, as a way to be “born again” in the community creative 
  process, transforming Minneapolis into a city that values justice and love through 
  an across the board application of the Golden Rule (see my Chapter 5) not just 
  giving it lip service? Well, Lutherans? What say you? <br />

<p><strong>Blog #202: October 24, 2003: The NAACP’s Reverse Divestiture: Expel 
  the Future, Invest in the Past, Divest the Prize. My response? Another definitive 
  paper seeking common ground: “Restorative Affirmative Action.” </strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow’s scheduled NAACP general meeting (cancelled by the Executive Committee 
  even though it is not supposed to cancel general meetings by NAACP rules) is 
  now a postponed red letter day for the NAACP, as in the red letter worn by Hester 
  Pryn: the Scarlet Letter of Shame. When they will officially hold their day 
  of shame as the national already did (see Blog #196). Three red letters: DPF 
  for Divest the Prize of Freedom. </p>
<p>Tomorrow the local NAACP was to officially announce the national NAACP’s October 
  18 decision to expel me for five years, and in the process reverses the divestiture 
  campaign against South Africa. To successfully end apartheid, South Africa practiced 
  ubuntu, a Bantu word for reconciliation, to bring together the separate parts 
  to heal the nation (see my Blog entries #163-164, 172). The NAACP separates. 
  The NAACP should stand for restoration, the restoration of the descendents of 
  slaves to the mainstream of American society. This is not rhetoric. This is 
  not pie in the sky. I offer two papers to show how. Both are in the “Solution Papers” section of www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. </p>
<p>The first paper, to be posted today in honor of what the NAACP should adopt 
  rather than expel, outlines the need for restorative affirmative action and 
  outlines how to achieve the need for <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a>. </p>
<p>The second paper is my already posted <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> recipe for how resolve the emergencies of the inner cities 
  of America in general and Minneapolis in particular, taken from with some additions, 
  my book, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes. These plus my book are my gifts 
  to Minneapolis. These still remain a challenge to the <i>Star Tribune, </i> 
  the <i>Pioneer Press, </i> <i>Insight News, </i> and <i>One Nation News, </i> 
  four local papers that have steadfastly refused to print one line about the 
  book (all were given copies) or its recommended remedies. </p>
<p>We are a city in Crisis. And because it isn&#8217;t being met, we are a city with 
  an Emergency. And yet with my book and these papers we have dynamic solutions 
  for resolving our crisis, ending the emergency, and ushering in an exciting 
  tomorrow. These four city newspapers papers, on the other hand, have offered 
  no rebuttal or their own solutions except a continued silence and, on occasion, 
  warmed over nostrums picked up by looking through the rear view mirror. They 
  are out of touch. I welcome this opportunity to bring them in touch, to connect 
  the dots for them. </p>
<p><i>The Minnesota Spokesman Recorder </i> and <i>City Pages, </i> on the other 
  hand, have heralded the book and brought it to the attention of their readers, 
  as well as run columns and stories about how to address the problems of our 
  fair city. And what about the <i>Coalition of Black Churches/African American 
  Leadership Summit? </i> They told their people not to read the book, and in 
  stead have bought into the notion that it will take generations to solve the 
  problems. But that goes against what Martin Luther King, Jr. said, in the title 
  of one of his books: Why We Can’t Wait. </p>
<p>What do they fear? They fear the people of the inner city will see they are 
  Plantation Mastuhs who wear no clothes and who work for themselves, not for 
  the people (see Blog entries #200 and 201). I challenge all of these papers 
  and groups to offer better solutions to our inner city problems. I challenge 
  them to cast off their roles of “bell curve liberals” and repudiate the notion 
  that Blacks can’t make it on their own, which has been the policy foundation 
  of the Federal, state and city governments ever since they opted to follow the 
  1968 Kerner Commission Report, giving them cover to institute the equivalent 
  of benign Jim Crow. Both the <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a> piece and the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> offer suggestions for resolving our emergency. What suggestions 
  to the NAACP and the media offer? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #201. October 24, 2003: NAACP to its members: Stand down! Get 
  in line. Force Civil Rights illiteracy with Book Burning. Follow through where 
  Abraham left off: Sacrifice the lives of your children on the altar of our power. 
  </strong></p>
<p>The “powers at be” in Minneapolis and the NAACP headquarters and their minions 
  at the Strib, Insight, and One Nation News, Coalition of Black Churches/African 
  American Leadership Summit, have done their level best to see that my book “The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” received no hearing, saw no light of day, 
  other than the light from the pyres of fire set for burning the book. In slave 
  days, the Mastuhs kept power by keeping us from learning to read and write and 
  learning about our conditions. We were their captives unable to read the road 
  signs to leave. These groups would keep us that way. </p>
<p>In today’s inner city, the NAACP works to continue the illiteracy of our children 
  and their disenfranchisement from education (ever since bussing) as a way to 
  keep people in dependency in order to justify their paid jobs. Thus they have 
  fought hard and conspired long to censor a member, yours truly, Ron Edwards. 
  And why not? My book would liberate the inner city Plantation descendents of 
  American slaves. It would require the bureaucrat Mastuhs to earn an honest living, 
  and it would mean truly working with the power structures to free our inner 
  city people. </p>
<p>But the NAACP would rather play Pharoah than Moses. Fearing the disturbance 
  of their own little sand boxes paid for by government, foundation and corporate 
  funds and grants, they have instead “sent a message” of intimidation to their 
  membership nationwide: go against us and we will ostracize you, the highest 
  penalty of any tight knit group already considered outsiders in a society: exclusion, 
  the one thing we fought the most and the one tactic they play so well. Why? 
  Because they are not a servant organization. They have no love in their hearts. 
  They have no concept of ubuntu and reconciliation (see Blog entries 163, 164, 
  167, 172). </p>
<p>They sleep in the basement bedrooms of the Mastuh at night, enjoying the luxuries, 
  and to keep those luxuries, are willing to whip the field hands by day, for &#8220;generations&#8221; as the recent local NAACP President said. </p>
<p>So what they are doing in Minneapolis has to be the tip of a very big iceberg 
  that they don’t want exposed in Minneapolis nor at their national HQ nor in 
  the other cities across America. Black leaders across the country who want to 
  see the NAACP do what it was set up to do will think twice because they don’t 
  want to be on the outside. It is not just silencing me that is their concern. 
  It is anyone in the country that would stand up them. People not allowed much 
  in the White world cling to what little they can get from the Black world, and 
  this is the great club of intimidation and mendacity wielded by the modern NAACP 
  that would rather truck with Black dictators in foreign lands that free our 
  inner city people from the dicates holding them down (see <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye Off Prize</a>). The message is clear: shape up or ship out. 
  Stand down. And oh by the way, they are saying, we have delayed the announcement 
  from the 18th to the 25th to give you time to destroy the records. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #200. October 24, 2003: The NAACP Plot thickens: State, regional 
  and local march to the corrupt tune of national: Duluth shenanigans, Saturday, 
  October 18, 2003, state conference. </strong></p>
<p>Regional NAACP attended the Duluth state conference and helped rig another 
  election, so this time it was Booker T Hodges who fell victim, beating him 16 
  to 11, with Gale Ford pressuring Kay Falls, Mankato and Rochester, cutting deals 
  with these branches to let them receive monies for a prison program that the 
  national NAACP has. So Ford bought the votes to defeat Booker T by promising 
  that if they supported Claudie Washington, State President, against Booker T 
  (who has bee n seen with the notorious Boss Edwards). They would get $20-40,000, 
  a nice chunk of change for small branches. </p>
<p>AND, in the same Duluth, MN meeting, the question of audits came up. Gale Ford 
  ruled, as Regional Director, that the only audit that would take place would 
  take place under his supervision and would only go back one year. Technically, 
  that would take it back such that the time his live in honey who he had elected 
  in Minneapolis to prevent her being investigated. He slyly said, sounding oh 
  so compassionate and feeling of their pain, that they had to understand that 
  people come and go, and that a lot of time “records come and go with them&#8221; such 
  that you don’t have information to reconcile everything, so he ordered them, 
  under his supervision, to not go back any further than one year. Unbelievable. 
  He is signally to them to be as self serving for themselves as he is being for 
  himself: records come and go, with the emphasis not being on “go.” </p>
<p>The NAACP has long stood for having an opportunity to stand for and achieve 
  good for the community. But there are obviously two NAACPs: the public face 
  of news releases and official statements living off the reputation of its great 
  past, and the dark side, the real NAACP, that has hidden in the closet. I’m 
  now calling out the NAACP. They can expell me as they decided on the 18 to do. 
  But in expelling me they are expelling themselves out of the closet of secrecy. 
  If all of this begins a movement to clean up its act, nationally, regionally, 
  locally, city to city across this great nation, so that the NAACP once again 
  serves our people, then all of this will have well been worth the experience 
  they have put me through. </p>
<p>The key question remains: will they deal with the key issues of education, 
  jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, governing, or ethics, as I have 
  in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper, or will they continually to pull the shades over 
  the fact that they are bankrupt of ideas, as their energies are self serving 
  of their organization and positions rather than the movement and its people?

  to a New Fork in the Road: Serve the Movement or Serve the Staff? The Past Finally 
  Catches Up as the NAACP Rushes to The Future Furtively Shredding Documents and 
  Violating the Letter and Spirit of the Law as it Betrays the Movement and Exposes 
  its own irrelevance as currently constituted. </strong></p>
<p>Here are the questions for the NAACP: nullification and reversal or affirmation 
  and march on? Stand proud on the barricades or slip silently into the muck of 
  corruption? Those are the choices the NAACP has now presented Black Americans 
  by the way they have handled not only the improprieties in Minneapolis but their 
  own complicity in those improprieties. </p>
<p>Two audits have been ordered. The first is of the local branch NAACP. The order 
  came down on Saturday, October 18, 2003 from national. That very same day recently 
  resigned President Al Gallman immediately began the now familiar exercise of 
  the corrupt: shredding documents and removing them from the NAACP offices, even 
  though any order for an audit always means freezing the process so all items 
  can be looked at. If, and this remains a big if, all of the document are there, 
  the audit will show the e successfully conspired to place in the local presidency 
  shortly before she left town to live with him. And we know from depositions 
  already in the hands of the national NAACP that, if all the records are available 
  and not shredded or hidden, that the complicity would reach all the way to the 
  office of national President Mfume and his senior staff, Paula Edny, the Reverend 
  Jerome Reed, and possibly even Nelson Ripperts. But again, we live in a “smoking 
  gun” culture, of doubting (or should I say “enabling”) Thomases, where we say 
  if a tree falls in the woods and there is no one to hear it there is no sound: 
  by shredding documents and hiding them away, there is now no “proof.” No matter. 
  We know that the document shredders and hiders are, by their actions, corrupt, 
  unjust, and unfair, and not adult enough to stand up for what they have done.

<p><strong>Blog #198. October 22, 2003: NAACP: Answering Machines Replace the 
  The Bridge; Treading Water Replaces Marching. </strong></p>
<p>The Modern Civil Rights Movement crossed the bridge to relevancy and significance 
  when marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama on March 7, 1965, 
  in their march on the capital from Selma to Birmingham. Those brave marchers 
  began from the reality of racial equality on paper that was nullified by Jim 
  Crow laws that forced them to live the life of racial inequality: that was the 
  “genius” of Jim Crow. March 7 Bloody Sunday stepped up the battle for equal 
  access and equal opportunity. The NAACP stood tall that day. Now the NAACP wants 
  us to stand down, to stop marching, to leave the barricade. Indeed, their Baltimore 
  fortress has raised its draw bridge. Easy access is denied. We can’t get in. 
  They don’t have to leave. For two years I have heard from people trying to reach 
  the NAACP that they usually get recordings. And when they get a live person 
  they get referred to someone who answers with a recording. Folks who have called 
  this week to get information about the receivership of our local branch got 
  recordings or were told the only comments would come from the communications 
  department. And when referred there the result was the same: getting a recording. 
  It is as if their procedure is to screen recordings and then determine whether 
  to respond. Folks I’ve talked to got recordings, not people. This is not the 
  sign of an organization on the march. </p>
<p>The NAACP no longer marches. It treads water, preferring the bathing in luxury 
  with dictators to the harsh reality of hard work in the inner cities (see <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye Off Prize</a>).</p>
<p>We now turn one of our spirituals on the NAACP: “how long O Lord, how long,” 
  before you raise up this organization once again to serve its people instead 
  of self-serving its “leaders.” I repeat my mantra: complaining isn’t an option 
  without suggesting a solution. The NAACP whines and complains while the spirits 
  of our people in the inner cities are extinguished, as, like the NAACP phones, 
  they are put on hold by those who claim to fight for them. I’ll know the NAACP 
  is back on track when they either endorse or provide an alternative to my suggested

<p><strong>Blog #197. October 22, 2003: City Hall is Vacant, Civil Rights are 
  Dead, and the Mayor Has Left the Building. Post script promised yesterday: Obstructionists: 
  Bell Curve Liberals and Conservatives </strong></p>
<p>In my weekly column today, I write about the dark days ahead for Minneapolis, 
  our fair city, because of my sense that “City Hall is Vacant, Civil Rights are 
  Dead, and the Mayor Has Left the Building.” Yesterday I discussed the Black 
  and White “leaders/spokesmen” and suggested that they were like the six blind 
  men describing an elephant, all with a piece and none with the whole. Who speaks 
  for who is irrelevant because the real issue is the gap between Blacks and Whites 
  in seven crucial areas discussed in <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a><strong>. </strong>The issue isn’t who speaks for who 
  or who does what to who but how we respond to the who’s and the what’s. These 
  seven areas have intentionally created and fostered gaps accommodated by those 
  claiming to be spokesmen, Black and White. My interest is not in who gets the 
  credit or who speaks for who, but to use the Seven Solutions to close the gaps. 
  But I assure one and all that this is the elephant in the living room, and all 
  its parts are real: (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, 
  (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics. As are the desired YESes 
  and undesired NOs outlined in Chapter 5. My challenge to all and a sundry is 
  to find common cause among these common YESes and NOs and to then work to reconcile 
  differences and reconcile with each other, both as institutions and as individuals. 
  I offered up South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s ubuntu theology/philosophy 
  of reconciliation as a potential model to follow (see Blog entries 163, 164, 
  167, and 172. The challenge is to discuss these together. </p>
<p>Post script: Obstructionists: Bell Curve Liberals and Conservatives. Promised 
  yesterday. Two books: the 1968 Kerner Commission Report and the 1998 “The Bell 
  Curve,” the first from liberals, the second from conservatives. Both excellent. 
  Both with good things to teach us. Both with small sections that have overshadowed 
  all the good they did. Both concluded that Blacks can’t make it on their own 
  and thus must have special support from the government. The first because they 
  are not like “normal” immigrants as they came as slaves, and the second because 
  they are too dumb (ranking last after, in order, Asians, Whites, Browns, Blacks). 
  Conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan quotes liberal blogger Mickey Kaus as follows: 
  Mickey Kaus once described those liberals who simply assume the permanent neediness 
  of minorities as “Bell Curve Liberals,” people who would never admit it but 
  have internalized the notion that minorities are simply dumber than the majority. 
  They either believe that such inferiority is in part genetic and in part environmental 
  or entirely environmental. But the upshot is always the same: these people are 
  helpless; and all we can do is right the system to disguise it as much as possible 
  and minimize social resentment and division. </p>
<p>Besides having lots of discussion groups discussing my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solution</a> areas, I invite any of claim to be “spokesmen” to do what 
  I propose in this paper: 7. f. Call &#8220;a family meeting&#8221;: as has been pointed 
  out elsewhere, back in the year 2000, Dave Jennings, now with the school district, 
  in discussing the stadium problem, said &#8220;someone other than the teams has to 
  create a public discussion about the future of the Twins and the Vikings in 
  Minnesota. The teams are crying out for somebody to call the family meeting&#8221; 
  (Star Tribune,8-10-00). So too, the problems outlined in my book call out for 
  a public discussion, for a &#8220;family meeting.&#8221; Who should call it? Why not the 
  Urban League, the NAACP, or the two together? How about a newspaper? A company? 
  A coalition? Let the family meeting be called. Let the conversation begin. Use 
  this Solution Paper to develop the agenda. </p>
<p>If the seven areas represent the actual elephant in the living room, the bell 
  curve liberals (and conservatives) represent the ghosts in the living room that 
  have to be exorcised in order to adequately deal with the elephant. Left in 
  the room, these ghosts will, as the Shadow used to say, cloud men’s minds regarding 
  the solutions, something that is no laughing matter. Things will stay the same 
  until the claims just discussed are repudiated. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #196. October 22, 2003: Ron Edwards Expelled for 5 Years by National 
  NAACP: The Price of Dissent, The Price for Standing Up for the Principles The 
  NAACP has abandoned. </strong></p>
<p>The NAACP is now more a part of the problem than ever before, as its response 
  to dissent is not discussion or reconciliation or by seeking common ground solutions, 
  but rather through expulsion of dissenters and truth tellers. </p>
<p>Lets have some fun and jump the gun. Last Saturday, the national NAACP decided 
  to expel me for 5 years. They are keeping the decision “secret” until a national 
  board person comes to Minneapolis this Saturday, October 25, to announce the 
  decision. As soon as they made the decision on the 18th, the local officials 
  began shredding documents and taking other documents away. As I wrote in <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye Off Prize</a>, the NAACP has surely lost its way. </p>
<p>Thus, on Saturday, October 18, 2003, in Baltimore, MD, the Executive Board 
  of the NAACP demonstrated once again why the statement running at the top of 
  the pages of Chapter 14 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” 
  is true: “Black Organizations: Now Part of the Problem Rather Than the Solution.” 
  Now, a year later, this is true more than ever. The national board will announce 
  this Saturday, that: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Ron Edwards is expelled from the NAACP for five years, and can only be reinstated 
    by the national board. The recommendation for the other three who were recommended 
    for suspension with Ron Edwards was overturned. They may remain members. </li>
  <li>The local branch in Minneapolis that I have warned about will be placed 
    in a “level 4 administrative receivership.” A national board member will come 
    to Minneapolis to be administrator of the branch. </li>
  <li>The branch will be ordered to conduct an audit for the years 1999 - 2002. 
  </li>
  <li>They have ordered a hearing on the election irregularities of November, 
    2002. </li>
</ol>
<p>#4 is a mystery as the one they just banned, yours truly, Ron Edwards, is the 
  one at the center of the controversy. The rational for the five year expulsion 
  is because as a member of the local branch of the executive committee I am held 
  to a higher standard than any others as it pertains to “divulging information.” 
  This is akin to being expelled for telling the truth, and for failing to conform 
  to their desires to cover up the irregularities and illegalities of the branch. 
  In other words, as some have suggested, to accept the message but kill the messenger. 
  The meeting in question of which I “divulged” information was an open meeting. 
  To want to shut down even discussions from open meetings shows their paranoia 
  and, to any astute observe, suggests immediately they have something to hide. 
  They were also upset with my book. But note: NOT ONCE did anyone from the national 
  NAACP enter into a discussion about this or my book with me. This is their Plantation 
  mentality running amuck. </p>
<p>The NAACP is on a collision course with irrelevancy. In the Solution Papers 
  section of this Web Site are two papers on the NAACP: the first the offering 
  of an olive branch, July 3, 2003, is a <a href="../../solutionpapers/09letterminn_jul2003.htm">letter 
  from my publisher to the National NAACP</a> Executive Officers, which 
  they all ignored and didn’t respond to. But dialogue is not their goal, only 
  dictating to others. The 2003 NAACP annual meeting in Florida shows just how 
  badly it has lost its way (see Solution Papers section for <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye Off Prize. </a> </p>
<p>My goal is to help them find their vision. I believe my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece will enable any group sincere about doing something 
  positive regarding the inner cities to do so. The NAACP is in a unique position 
  to help. Instead, it has opted out for the status quo. That is a dangerous view 
  and risks sending the NAACP off into the sunset of irrelevancy due to its mediocrity 
  and laziness. May it regain its vision and work to create and sustain a wonderful 
  place to live.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #195. October 22, 2003: NAACP has new initials: ENRON: shredding 
  documents, taking them from the office</strong></p>
<p>In addition to documents pertinent to the audit that are being shredded or 
  taken out of the office, are related documents that are copies of communiqués 
  between NAACP leadership and the police department passing information to them 
  in situations where people in our neighborhoods have been complaining about 
  police brutality, providing information to the authorities exposing our people 
  to the police. You have one of two things going on: the people shredding/taking 
  documents have either been authorized or have not been authorized but, given 
  a week’s time, “wink wink,” just “know” what has to be done to protect the organization. 
  That this shredding and removal of documents began right after the national 
  decision to order an audit ought to be embarrassing. But the local branch and 
  regional director and national organization have moved to the point where they 
  have no shame. Regional Director Ford did not call and say freeze everything 
  for national to look at. Instead he said start purging as soon as possible, 
  as the audit will lead directly back to him and his current employee and live 
  in lover Shayla Lindsey, who he helped rig the election in November 2002. And 
  why didn’t the national want the audit order made public for a week? So they 
  could get their document ducks all in a row, shredded or hidden. </p>
<p>What makes this all the more extraordinary is that all of the shenanigans of 
  the local branch have been known. But the national is still in the mode of denial.

<p><strong>Blog #194. Tuesday, October 21, 2003 </strong></p>
<p>Who speaks for the Black Community or even “of” the Black community: the barber 
  shop? elected officials? Coalition of Black Churches? the African American Leadership 
  Summit? Minneapolis Spokesman-Recorder? Insight? One Nation News? KMOJ Forum? 
  Don Samuels? Natalie Johnson-Lee? Randy Staten? Clarence Hightower? Bill English? 
  Spike Moss? Doug Grow? The Strib? The Police-Community Federal Mediation Group? 
</p>
<p>Topics: Spokespersons for the Black community&#8212;- Blacks.&#8212;- Whites.&#8212;- The 
  Strib.&#8212;- Solution.&#8212;- Challenge.&#8212;- Postscript: Obstructionists: Bell Curve 
  Liberals and Conservatives. </p>
<p>Spokespersons for the Black community. This is a six blind men and the elephant 
  situation: each blind man accurately describes a part of the elephant but then 
  makes the crucial error of believing his part represents the whole. So too here, 
  in Minneapolis, where we seem to have a whole convention of blind men describing 
  an elephant only they “see.” </p>
<p>This is not a multiple choice question, although the Strib would make it so 
  nor is it a trick question as some of the indviduals above would have us believe. 
</p>
<p>The answer to the question of who speaks for the Black Community is truly simple: 
  White voters. </p>
<p>Although we appreciate the fact that Doug Grow has seen the movie “Barbershop,” 
  his seeming notion that Black barbershops have some kind of oracular status 
  like quilting bees or chamber of commerce gatherings, is just another stereotype. 
  For no matter what individuals or groups interviewed by Doug Grow, as he searches 
  the question Freud asked frustratingly about women, “My God, what do they want?”, 
  the ultimate spokespersons for the Black community are the White voters. So 
  lets look at it in terms of Whites, Blacks, the Strib, and Solutions. </p>
<p>Whites. It is what is enacted legislatively in terms of laws and regulations 
  and statutes that speak for all of us. Theoretically the majority rules but 
  not at the expense of the minority. In my book “The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes,” I outline in each of the seven areas above how the majority has not 
  only ruled at the expense of the minorities but with the help of the minorities 
  to boot. The policy that created the gaps between Whites and Blacks in seven 
  crucial areas, (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) 
  safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics, were passed by Whites. Slavery 
  laws were passed by Whites. So too Jim Crow laws and all the laws and statutes 
  aimed at foiling the Civils Rights and Voting Rights laws of the 60s. </p>
<p>And what the White voters have wrought in the Black community in terms of these 
  seven main areas with gaps between Blacks and Whites is not a pretty picture. 
  It all starts with education. Make that unequal and the other areas remain unequal. 
  The Whites created a societal pin ball game that can be tilted easily in their 
  favor. </p>
<p>Blacks. And here is where the Black community let itself down in its support 
  of bussing: how can parents be effective in their kids’ school if the school 
  is across town and how can kids have enough time to be kids and do home work 
  if they spend two hours a day in a bus? This was a White solution that enabled 
  Whites not to have to change housing patterns. Pure and simple. Blacks, instead 
  of fighting for integrated housing settled for integrated segregation: bussing 
  to schools integrated powerless kids and kept the adult communities separated. 
  Too many Blacks have helped tilt the game in the favor of Whites in order to 
  curry White favor for themselves, but at the expense of our kids and, hence, 
  the kids as adults after they pass through an education system that keeps them 
  illiterate and uneducated, without optimism, without hope. </p>
<p>To many of those wanting to be spokespersons for the Black community refuse 
  to be honest: they refuse to stand up and say “Hey, this is my city too, and 
  I want my Black face on it too.” Whites do it all the time. There is nothing 
  wrong with saying we want it too. The error is in denying we want it or denying 
  we said it, for no one believes it, Black or White. It is not racism for the 
  White to want a White Superindentent nor racism for the Black to want a Black 
  Superintendent. This is why Staten and English errored when they say the issue 
  with the schools is not the color of the Superintendent but the qualifications 
  and process (see their The Strib op ed at http://www.startribune.com/stories/562/4160619.html), 
  because at the community forum where Jennings was roasted, they made it clear 
  color IS the issue: “When you start looking for a permanent superintendent, 
  you&#8217;ve got to look for an educator, preferably, and let me be very clear, a 
  black educator,&#8221; as quoted in City Pages (see http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1193/article11581.asp). 
  Let me repeat: nothing wrong with that. And given the results of the previous 
  Black superintendent selected by the same process as Jenkins, they lose even 
  more credibility. </p>
<p>The Strib would have us to believe that the inner city is a problem of blacks 
  that is up to Blacks to solve, as it all depends on whether “residents have 
  the resolve to fight back” to which Council Member Don Samuels concurred when 
  he said that the community needs to confront dealers with “massive community 
  disapproval from someone who looks like them and someone able to demonstrate 
  love and affection who looks like them (see <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4161507.html" target="_blank">http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4161507.html</a>). 
  Its takes more than love and affection to beat addictions, both the addictions 
  of users and the addiction to the money of the sellers. And without some kind 
  of reasonable government sponsored public safety program and system of sanctions 
  for law breakers, no amount of love and affection is going to deter or stop 
  those inclined to do ill to others, who believe in a negative golden rule: do 
  others in before they do you in. </p>
<p>Solutions. The real issue remains the same: closing the gaps between Blacks 
  and Whites in 7 key areas: (1) education, (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public 
  safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics. </p>
<p>Arguing over “spokespersons” is a dodge. It is a way to force things back to 
  the status quo by trivialzing people who have no power to effect much change, 
  and, in the process, trivializing the few Black elected representatives like 
  Keith Ellison, Natalie Johnson-Lee, and Don Samuels. It is safe to say that 
  all of the “blind men” listed above seek the status quo. There is a set of solutions 
  on the table, as found in my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,&#8221; 
  which are summarized in Chapter 17 and then expanded on in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Key Themes, Seven Key Problems, Seven Key Solutions </a> paper on my 
  web site under “Solution Papers.” </p>
<p>And where have the Blacks and Whites been on the book, its recommendations, 
  or the 7 Solutions paper? With the exception of the Spokesman-Recorder and City 
  Pages, silent. Deathly silence. Not a conspiracy of silence. An open, purposeful, 
  intentional silence. The Strib openly agknowledges that the book is “shelved.” 
  They are hoping it will go away. It won’t. Insight and One Nation News and KMOJ 
  Forum have refused requests to be interviewed or have a discussion. The Coalition 
  of Black Churches / Leadership Forum openly railed against the book for two 
  hours, telling their people not to read it, not to buy it. The NAACP has expelled 
  me for 5 years for writing about them in the book. What in the world are they 
  afraid of? I honestly believed they would all say thank you and get together, 
  harmoniously, and find the common ground in the desired YESes and undesired 
  NOs of Chapter 5. Instead of saying &#8220;this is great, we have something to work 
  with, we get louder acclimations of who is a spokesperson and leader, from people, 
  Black and White, who are not leading. This is why I have stated that “City Hall 
  is Vacant, Civil Rights are Dead, and the Mayor Has Left the Building.” </p>
<p>Challenge: I challenge all who would be “voices for the community,” be they 
  White or Black, elected or appointed officials, government or nonprofit or church 
  agency staffers, and residents and taxpayers anywhere, to discuss the seven 
  solutions paper in the Solution Papers section of my web site as well as the 
  YESes and NOs common ground approach in my book as summarized in Chapter 17. 
  My editor will be in town for a week in mid or late November. We would welcome 
  the opportunity to discuss these with the Strib columnists and editors, local 
  radio and TV talk shows, city council, Mpls.Forum issues list, and anyone else 
  from Governor to Mayor to neighborhood resident. Any who would like to host 
  us, in either the Black or White community or jointly, we welcome the opportunity 
  to come to discuss these seven areas and proposed solutions, from pulpit to 
  board room, from neighborhood to lunch room, from mainstream papers to Black 
  papers to alternative papers, from Editors and writers to Executives and managers 
  to teachers and preachers to any and all interested in closing these gaps. Any 
  place, any time. </p>
<p>Although Martin Luther King, Jr. was the out front spokesman for the civil 
  rights movement, he would not have been effective had it not been for the “unseen” 
  spokespersons such as Thurgood Marshall and his phalanx of NAACP lawyers arguing 
  in the courts, especially before the Supreme Court, and Clarence Carter (“Mr. 
  Civil Rights), who tirelessly worked the halls of Congress to line up votes 
  for the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and other civil rights legislation 
  in the 50s and 60s. We certainly appreciate the input from all of the folks 
  listed in the title of this Blog entry. But we know more is needed than spokespersons. 
  Needed is effective engagement behind the scenes with those who write the laws 
  and interpret them in the legislature as well as the city and its council and 
  agencies. In our <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece, we list the seven areas that need to be addressed 
  in Minneapolis, as listed above: (1) education, ((2) jobs, ((3) housing, ((4) 
  public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and (7) ethics. </p>
<p>As long as any of the “blind men” deflect the discussion away from these issues 
  and onto specific individuals, they can continue their status quo party. Lets 
  change the status quo. Let’s close the gaps in these areas. And let’s do it 
  now. </p>

<p>Who represents the Black Community? Events, in the short term, are making the 
  mediation team the representative, a short term solution but not one for the 
  long term. But it does provide an interim answer to “who speaks for the Black 
  community?” In the long term, we know of two who speak for us: Nellie Stone 
  Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>Last Tuesday the chief met with the mediation team about the events surrounding 
  the stories that broke that day regarding the alleged sodomization of prisoners 
  held in police custody. He met with them a day before the big press conference. 
  The leadership of both the Black and White communities have abdicated their 
  responsibilities. So now any reform or anything anyone is talking about will 
  have more success coming through the Federal Mediation Group, by default as 
  one of the few left with its credibility in tact. This is a sad reflection of 
  how the leadership, Black and White, have gone about snatching defeat from the 
  jaws of victory. They could have done it differently. We hope to snatch victory 
  from the jaws of defeat by reflecting on the work and insights of two we do 
  know who will always speak for the Black community: Nellie Stone Johnson (see 
  Interlude 3 of my book) and Martin Luther King, Jr. (see Interludes 4 and 15). 
  So far, Blacks and Whites alike act like the six blind men describing an elephant, 
  each getting a part of it right but none getting the whole picture. Tomorrow 
  I will outline my sense of the picture as a whole and how to bring all the different 
  actors together in common cause to address the seven areas with great gaps between 
  inner city Blacks and the Whites of Greater Minneapolis: (1) education, (2) 
  jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and 
  (7) ethics (to read more about these seven, see my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece in the Solution Papers section of this web site.

<p><strong>Blog #192. October 19, 2003: Lady Justice is abused, her clothes torn 
  off, as she is beaten in the public square</strong></p>
<p>The thing that makes America great is the Lady Justice wears a blindfold. She 
  doesn’t see color or gender or party. She presumes innocence until proven guilty. 
  This week, in Minneapolis, Lady Justice had her blindfold torn off and her cloak, 
  so that she stood exposed, naked, forced against her will to stand against the 
  accused on both sides of those involved in the police/community interactions 
  and accusations. This is not the way to calm a community already in high anxiety.

<p><strong><a name="03191b1018"></a>Blog #191. October 18, 2003: #2 of 2 comments on The Strib as Slayer, 
  Not Healer: The Strib finally finds its voice through the stereo voices of Don 
  Samuels and Doug Grow, when it should be using wrap around sound from all voices 
  (<a href="#03190b1016">See Blog entry #190 For comment #1</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The two pieces Thursday on October 16 in the Strib about mounting tensions 
  in Minneapolis reflect the Strib finding its voice again: how to clearly maintain 
  the status quo, how to tell, as I’m told the phrase was used on the Mpls.Forum 
  issues list, “the good Negroes from the bad Negroes,” and thus, in James Baldwin’s 
  phrase, “keep them in their place.” On the surface, Council Member Don Samuels 
  op ed piece (http://www.startribune.com/stories/562/4156412.html) and Doug Grow’s 
  column (http://www.startribune.com/stories/465/4156864.html) are well written 
  and well spoken. On the surface. As far as they go. They need to get below the 
  surface. It is what’s below that is missing in these pieces that concerns me. 
  The challenge to Minneapolis is clear, as I outline in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> areas, a challenge in 7 areas that I find missing in 
  Don and Doug: education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, governing, 
  and ethics. This is why I maintain that the Strib breaks its compact with the 
  community because it takes sides (Ok for editorials and columns, but not for 
  reporting) and stresses the status quo rather than inviting needed change (see 
  my earlier blog entries: 32, 36-37, 58, 67, 117, 140-141, 167, 171, and 175), 
  and we have written before on CM Sammuels (see Blog entries 146, 87, 83, 82). 
</p>
<p>The page title of Chapter 16 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My 
  Eyes,” is this: “Unrest, Disturbance: The Status Quo Price Minneapolis is Willing 
  to Pay.” We see this in the two Strib commentaries noted above. The difference 
  can be seen between them and the 7 Solutions piece of mine referenced above: 
  they address the challenge of keeping “the bad Negroes” under control” and “in 
  their place.” My book and my columns and my web log is all about these seven 
  areas and the challenge to make the need changes in them. The Strib is about 
  the change needed to maintain the status quo. In his op-ed, Don correctly identifies 
  the racial aspect which he correctly notes must be recognized. And he correctly 
  identifies the problems in the Black community of gangs, drugs, and crime. He 
  also notes the existence of “renegade police.” But he accepts the status quo, 
  blames it all on hate that comes from being kept in the status quo, and calls 
  for incarcerating those unwilling to accept the status quo with their gangs, 
  drugs, and crime. There can be no healing with the status quo. The only healing 
  that can come is from changes in the status quo, especially in terms of education, 
  jobs and housing. Until then, this is the unrest Minneapolis is willing to accept 
  to keep the status quo. </p>
<p>Doug Grow hides the status quo by writing as if this was all new. He correctly 
  notes the need for the police to be “connected to the community” (which is what 
  our mediation group is all about trying to establish) and that “the glimmer 
  of hope” he sees is in the fact that many in the Black community see the majority 
  of cops as “good people.” But that has never been in dispute. Its the “enforcers” 
  that we have complained about. Nellie Stone Johnson said it best: “no education, 
  no jobs, no hope.” Where is the “glimmer of hope” for education, jobs, and housing? 
  These are the missing keys to hope that the Strib continues to ignore in its 
  quest to keep the status quo. For healing to take place we need to close the 
  gaps in educational achievement between Blacks and Whites (my Chapter 7) and 
  hold the school system accountable, especially the elementary schools, for if 
  kids leave there unable to read how can the middle or high schools do their 
  jobs). For healing to take place we need to close the gap in jobs caused by 
  the city’s non-compliance in jobs for minorities (my Chapter 9), and hold the 
  city accountable for being in non-compliance. For healing to take place we need 
  to close the gaps in providing access to housing (my Chapter 8), and hold the 
  city accountable for not having done so, starting with MDCA and Hollman. The 
  only action that we see is that which will maintain the status quo in these 
  areas rather than actually seeking real change to close these gaps. The city, 
  in sum, doesn’t want to close these gaps. It works to maintain them. And thus 
  it is willing to accept the cycle of hopelessness, helplessness, gangs, drugs, 
  and crime in the Black communities of the inner city in order to keep those 
  gaps, and jail young Black men as they become involved in them (see pp. 154-156 
  of my book). That is the dark side for African Americans of the status quo supported 
  by the Strib and its scribblers. </p>

  Not Healer: Printing About Healing As It Works to Divide and Conquer the Black 
  Community, Laying Waste More leaders to find its own Annointed</strong></p>
<p>Don Sammuels was well positioned with his op. ed. piece on Thursday, October 
  16, 2003: “City Must Seek Accountability and Healing” (<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/562/4156412.html" target="_blank">here</a>). 
  This comments is about its placement in the Strib that did not include another 
  submitted by a Black leadership group. In tomorrow&#8217;s Blog entry I’ll comment 
  on the content along with that of the Doug Grow column. </p>
<p>It is an interesting article with some interesting statements. He addresses 
  problems in both arenas of accountability and healing. And yet the “Black leadership” 
  group had sent an op-ed piece into the Strib six days earlier regarding their 
  position regarding the School Board’s selection of a Superintendent of schools 
  and the attacks they were under because of their stance, and yet the Strib did 
  not print it. They chose instead to print the Grow/Gallman version. This doesn’t 
  take anything away from CM Samuels. It just proves the point I’ve made over 
  time of the selective nature of the Strib to set up what it considers to be 
  the good Negroes and cut out the bad Negroes, how it sets itself up to determine 
  the news fit to print and the news it chooses to ignore. A truly journalistic 
  newspaper would present both statements. Positioning someone to be spokesman 
  in their eyes is OK, but even good leaders can be neutralized if the perception 
  is made that they are working for the Strib and not the community. The Strib 
  does neither the White nor the Black community any favors by inserting itself 
  into the news one one side rather than reporting the different positions. It 
  further strains the relationship between Don and the Mayor and Don and Natalie 
  Johnson-Lee at a time when Don is trying to find a way to achieve both accountability 
  and healing, something that is supported by all sides. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #189. October 16, 2003: 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Part 4 of 4: 
  Pausing to Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American</strong></p>
<p>Part 4 of 4: The “pathways” for maintaining our security as well as our civic 
  values of freedom at home and leadership for peace in the world and, therefore, 
  equal access and equal opportunity for all citizens, and tools, skill, optimism 
  and hope for doing so. </p>
<p><strong>Part IV.</strong> For Parts I, II, and III, see Blog entries 131, 133, 
  and 135, </p>
<p>There are a pair of “pathways” to start with to enable We the People to still 
  count. These are two of many. These two are offered as starters for the discussion 
  and as blueprints for action to take. The first pathway is in the “Solution 
  Papers” section of this web site, my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper, which covers these 7 topics: (1) education, (2) 
  jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, and 
  (7) moral/ethical stances. These are followed by my rationale and a list of 
  additional resources. The second pathway is posted on the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/index.html" target="_blank">ISCV</a> 
  (Institute for the Study of Civic Values) web site. It has a series of rich 
  resources, including LINKS to statements and resources for dealing with these 
  topics pertinent to our dialogue in Minneapolis as well: <a href="http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Cities/cities.html" target="_blank"><br>
  CITIES</a> | <a href="http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/CommDev/commdev.html" target="_blank">HOUSING</a>

<p>These sites help provide excellent starting points for the leadership, White 
  and Black. The spotlight of justice is upon them. Rather than trying to run 
  and hide (they can run but they can’t hide), I invite them to join me in an 
  honest discussion of these points. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #188. October 15, 2003: It takes two to tango: private and pubic 
  sector, to create equal access and equal opportunity</strong></p>
<p>White refusal to be fair or cooperate is another reason why we still need affirmative 
  action.Example: Atlanta. Maynard Jackson, first Black mayor of Atlanta died 
  earlier this month. USA Today, 10-3-03, p. 3A, said of him: he “pioneered the 
  city’s affirmative action program, which forced city contactors to take on minority 
  and female partners. The program became a national model and created a generation 
  of black and female wealth.” When he became mayor, White contractors were getting 
  99.88% of city contracts. As Mayor Blacks went from .12% to 34% before being 
  cut back by court order [that is .0012 before and .34 after]. It is this compliance 
  that is missing by the City of Minneapolis, as I discuss in Chapter 9 of my 
  book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.” For those who say Affirmative 
  Action is not needed, this is an example that refutes that claim. The history 
  of Minneapolis noncompliance and freezing out Black contractors is another.

<p><strong>Blog #187. October 14, 2003: The Recall In California Also Recalled 
  Politics As Usual and Called for the “Common Ground” Approach Advocated in The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</strong></p>
<p>The election produced a pro-choice, pro-affirmative action fiscal conservative 
  Republican who accepts gays and medical if not recreational marihuana. This, 
  it seems to me, will be viewed as not only an historic recall election but a 
  vote bringing welcome seismic tremors. My concerns of the inner city are the 
  results of people fighting not for people but for ideas staked out either to 
  the far left or far right with inner city Blacks, especially school kids, squeezed 
  in the middle. Missing until October 7, 2003, was a credible view of and chance 
  for a middle ground all could stand on. With 23% of the Black vote and 41% of 
  the Hispanic vote and 57% of the woman’s vote and 50% of the union vote and 
  60% of the total vote going to the two Republicans in the California recall, 
  ideology was replaced with a sense of reality driven by a desire for practicality, 
  that to succeed California had to find a common ground. The so-called base of 
  the Democratic Party has obviously departed the common sense message of JFK: 
  to spur economic growth and create jobs taxes must be cut. How can this be done 
  when Sacramento increased spending 40% over four years and added 44,000 employees 
  to the government payroll despite a hiring freeze, as well as other rules and 
  regulations and levees on both employers and employees, creating a $38 billion 
  deficit and other consequences resulting in tens of thousands leaving the state? 
</p>
<p>Having worked in California on several Presidential campaigns, including that 
  of Hubert Humphrey, I am familiar with its make up. You can image my shock to 
  see in this recall election that three of the richest areas went to Davis by 
  63% (San Mateo County), 68% (Marin County) and 80% (San Francisco), whereas 
  three of the poorer counties went to Schwarzenegger, with the percentages 64% 
  (Merced County), 72% (Tulare County), and 75% (Lassen County). These voting 
  results suggest that the Democrats, as I have outlined in my book, have lost 
  their ability to represent ordinary people. As my book The Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes makes clear, Democrats do not represent Blacks in the inner 
  cities. Rather, they treat the not rich and minorities as if they are workers 
  on a plantation to be domesticated. The Democratic Party has to ask itself this 
  question: was the Davis administration what a liberal Congress and Presidency 
  would look like and govern? If not, what will it do to repudiate what is wrong 
  with that picture and uphold what is right? </p>
<p>Add the huge vote for Governor elect Schwartzennegger by Evangelical Christians 
  and his bringing Willie Brown (a Black who ran Sacramento and more recently 
  serves as Mayor of San Francisco) onto his team, and the reality of this is 
  seen all the more. If this can be extended to the inner cities, we will solve 
  the problems long left unchanged by the two major political parties for half 
  a century. I, for one, wish him well. I’ll know how successful he is being by 
  how he addresses the problems of the inner city. I’ll be particularly keeping 
  my eye on Watts. And if the Democrats try to do to him what the Republicans 
  tried from day one to Bill Clinton and, tit for tat, the Democrats have tried 
  to do to George W. Bush from day one, bring him down and not cooperate, we may 
  well see those percentages above for Blacks, Hispanics and women increase across 
  the country. We can’t wait until a Democrat is elected to then solve the problems 
  and get credit. Oh wait. They just had a Democrat and he not only didn’t solve 
  the problems he made them worse. But if the Democrats will work with the Republicans, 
  then we will have a healthy two party system again. I wish that on all of us. 
  And I wish it particularly for those of us in Minneapolis and Minnesota. </p>
<p>For those who don’t like the recall idea, and I’m one, I still have to remind 
  you of the last three words of the Constitution’s tenth amendment that divides 
  the power between the federal state, the individual states, and the people: 
  “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited 
  by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

<p><strong>Blog #186. October 12, 2003: Personal Politics Beats Us Again in Education 
  as Reported by Doug Grow </strong></p>
<p>Doug Grow’s column Sunday reveals several truths, not all intended. First of 
  all, he gets it right when he says that the dissent from the Superintendent 
  designate was from a small but vocal group (“the BNBers,” the “Background Noise 
  Brigade”). And he gets it right that they feel slighted, but he gets it wrong 
  when he suggests they don’t have a right to be heard, no matter how small their 
  constituency may or may not be. Moving on, Doug gets it right when he says they 
  don’t represent the community as a whole as they claim because there were equally 
  vocal persons, Black and White, from the community who backed the Board’s decision. 
  And he gets it right that race was a big factor. Rightly or wrongly, they do 
  view the Superintendent’s position as a Black position. </p>
<p>But Doug gets it wrong when he says that the new Superintendent cut and ran, 
  implying he was not tough enough to fight, running after only a couple of news 
  conferences and court filings (this was probably a sop he threw to the Black 
  community to show he feels their pain). As I show in the next paragraph, there 
  was another group of “Background Noise” who do have clout, the Minneapolis Forum 
  Issues group that were unrelenting on the subject on a daily basis, many times 
  daily. He also misses the brilliant tactic used by the “pragmatic” resignation. 
  If the BNBers can be trivialized and discredited, and then enough people with 
  clout get angry, he can be rehired. He loses nothing by withdrawing and wins 
  multiple options by doing so, including getting rehired. He deflected the anger 
  off of himself and now the anger that counts is on the BNBers. Finally, in light 
  of the California election (which I’ll comment on later this week), the BNBers 
  may have been overtaken by history, with their approach now ill-timed and ill-served, 
  getting the same shelving as the Democrats got in California. On this there 
  should be no surprize. I’ve been warning about this. It is the basis of my “common 
  ground” approach in my book, a book these same people vilified. They could have 
  learned and achieved far more following its lessons. </p>
<p>The four truths Doug Grow exposes that he may not have meant to have exposed, 
  and indeed probably isn’t aware of it, are the more interesting ones: the first 
  is that he and his paper feel they can treat the “usual suspects” group of ‘leaders” 
  as trivial and insignificant. How else could he refer to them as mere background 
  noise, as “The Background Noise Brigade (BNB)” as “BNBers,&#8221; if doing so wasn&#8217;t 
  widely accepted. So I give a tip of the hat to Doug: that is a powerful put 
  down. It doesn&#8217;t make friends but I suspect that was never the purpose of the 
  column. The second is that the Star Tribune, as we have said over and over in 
  these daily web logs, filters the truth, and the anger from the Mayor’s office 
  is that they didn’t do it enough here. Rybak “blames the media, in part, for 
  giving too big of a voice to [the BNBer] who often is called ‘a leader in the 
  black community’ by those of us in the mainstream media.” He is signalling that 
  he doesn’t want to hear about them and that the Strib can ignore them in the 
  future with his blessing. The third is that the Mayor doesn’t believe in the 
  Minneapolis Public Schools, as his “children go to a prestigious private school.” 
  As I have said before, put the kids of the decision makers in the public schools 
  and you’ll see change fast. The fourth is the power of the Internet in the communications 
  of news and ideas. The anger against the School Board and the criticism of their 
  choice was unrelenting on a daily basis, through the day every day, on the Minneapolis 
  Forum, an issues list of nearly 1,000 engaged Minnesotans on both sides of the 
  political aisle. It is read by and contributed to by the School Board, by the 
  Mayor’s office, by Council Members, by city bureaucrats, by developers, by liberals 
  and conservatives and libertarians, influential people in both the public and 
  private sector. And it was on this list that the process and anger was laid 
  bare and there was nothing that could be done to stop it for such Issues Lists 
  have no head. My own position was that the cart was put before the horse, that 
  the problems of the school district, as laid out in detail in Chapter 7 of my 
  book, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, needed to be addressed first and 
  that given how the progress results numbers had been cooked, even by Black school 
  leaders, we needed to know the truth and what the board saw as the solution 
  besides the tired “its the parents fault” and the even more tired “it will take 
  generations to fix” before selecting a superintendent. As parents and/or tax 
  payers, we need a pledge that there will be a true change, not just more business 
  as usual. To show my constancy in seeking a common ground, let me state that 
  in the “7 Solutions” piece in the Solution Papers section of my web site, 
  I include the person who withdrew’s idea of calling “a Minneapolis family meeting” 
  as a way to resolve these issues. Whether he is rehired or not, his idea is 
  till first rate and needs to be followed. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #185. October 12, 2003: Without a “higher power” the nation becomes 
  god and the nation rules</strong></p>
<p>The “self evident truths” that we were all “created equal under God” was not 
  seen that way in the old South. To strengthen the hand of the citizen against 
  both the state and the falsehood that some humans were inferior to others, a 
  number of framers held out for the Bill of Rights. And thus it begins: “Congress 
  shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the 
  free exercise thereof” (meaning it can’t create a single state religion on the 
  one hand nor prevent religion on the other; many today falsely interpret this 
  as meaning we should do away with religion). If we do, all that is left is a 
  state with no virtue, no conscience, and citizens the same. There is no reason 
  for free speech, free assembly, etc., except as the government wants. At at 
  a time of national security preoccupations, it is important that we don’t endanger 
  our bill of rights in the name of security nor give up security for the bill 
  of rights for those who would do us in. But there are also Americans who would 
  take away the Bill of Rights of the Black man. Harry Truman said “If we don&#8217;t 
  have a proper fundamental moral background, we will finally end up with a totalitarian 
  government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the State!&#8221; 
  The social darwinists and evolution fundamentalists following Darwin are not 
  our friends. As Darwin said, referring to Africans and Aboriginal Australians 
  as &#8220;savages:&#8221; &#8220;Civilized races of man will almost certainly 
  exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world&#8230;The break 
  between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene 
  between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, 
  and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian 
  and the gorilla.&#8221; This, of course, influenced the Dred Scott Case of 1856 
  which stated that slaves &#8220;had for more than a century before been regarded 
  as beings of an inferior.” This was another contributor to the Civil War. It 
  is also behind the 1968 Kerner Commission Report that said Blacks were not like 
  others and couldn’t make it on their own without the help of state or the 1998 
  book The Bell Curve that says Blacks are too dumb to make it on their own, hence 
  blogger Mickey Kaus description of those liberals who simply assume the permanent 
  neediness of minorities as &#8220;Bell Curve Liberals,&#8221; people who, whether 
  they admit or understand it or not, have internalized the notion that minorities 
  are simply dumber than the majority. Why? Because too many Darwinists and secular 
  leftists don’t believe in God nor the positive aspects of men being created 
  equal before God, and if there is no God there is only the state, and if only 
  the state then only the state counts, and thus they will continue to try to 
  keep us in our place. When will our leaders, like those in the NAACP, the Black 
  Conference of Churches, the Black ministerial associations, begin to stand up 
  for us rather than sit down, ashamed of us and themselves, in order to appease 
  the Whites who fund them as their little Black Sambo voting pets? When will 
  the preachers, these ministers of the Gospel, stand up for reconciliation instead 
  of separation, for common ground cooperation rather than special interest entitlements? 
  When will they stand up for, preach and practice Archbishop Tutu&#8217;s ubuntu 
  theology of reconcilliation? For more on this see my Blog entries #163, 164, 
  167, and 172. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #184. October 11, 2003: Profiling the profilers: it is the profile 
  of racists</strong></p>
<p>The Star Tribune reported statistics on Monday, September 27, 2003 that racial 
  profiling absolutely irrefutable. The article quotes from the recent report 
  from the University of Minnesota. </p>
<p>Remember, as I point out in my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” 
  profiling is not the issue. But racial profiling is. The heart of the issue 
  is what the institutions are going to do about it, especially the Minneapolis 
  Police Department, the state legislature, the city council. Racial profiling 
  is harrassment by the state, pure and simple, as it is done by state officials. 
  Thus the institutions are responsible. In education racial profiling takes place, 
  as when the school counselor laughed at the idea that I wanted to go to college 
  (see Chapter 7 in my book). </p>
<p>As we all know from popular TV police dramas, profilers are trained professionals 
  with a sensible police technique that employs both patterns and probability 
  to make the best use of their scarce resources to solve crimes and to attack 
  and prevent crimes. No one is against that. Patterns and probability. Racial 
  profiling assumes there are areas where race represents a high probability of 
  a crime or potential crime. The use of race as a single criteria is not true 
  profiling; it is merely true racism. A Black youth standing on a corner does 
  not signal a crime, past or future. But a Black youth dealing drugs does. In 
  other words, its not the race that should be profiled but the activity or a 
  person’s past record, pattern, of behavior, “the usual suspects.” This practice 
  has spilled over to the practice of stopping and inspecting Blacks passing through 
  public places “they don’t belong” or if they have better than average clothes 
  or cars. The assumption that Blacks couldn’t possibly have nice cars or clothes 
  legally is clearly racist. After 9/11, no one objected, on 9/11 and 9/ 12, etc., 
  to the stopping of Arab and dark skinned Arab looking men. And given the reports 
  that there are thousands of Al Queda sleeper cells in this country, that profile 
  may well be required (accompanied by other factors, not just the onen of being 
  Arab) as well. </p>
<p>Here is an example from a report by Chad Thevenot of the Criminal Justice Policy 
  Foundation, “Crises of Anti-Drug Effort, 1999,” about the stopping of motorists 
  along a 50 mile stretch of I-95 in Maryland by their “Special Traffic Interdiction 
  Force: 76% of those stopped were Black even though Blacks only constitute 25% 
  of Maryland’s populatiaon and 20% of those with Maryland driver’s licenses. 
  In a New Jersey town, it was reported that 94% of motorists stopped were minorities. 
  If it was true that Blacks commit a high percentage of crime, it would make 
  sense. That would be good profiling. But they do not. Thus the profiling is 
  based solely on race (and when young Black men of means are stopped, a probably 
  role of envy and resentment by the officers). We pay police to be suspicious. 
  We do not pay them to be suspicious on account of a person’s race. The question 
  is simple, If there are a disproportionate number of Blacks, Hispanics and other 
  minorities engaged in criminal behavior, it makes sense. But that is not the 
  case. Therefore it is not efficiency that is at work but rather racism. </p>
<p>As I note in my book, pp. 150-151, 6% of all users of illegal drugs are White, 
  yet 70% of drug convictions are Black. And for those who say it is not users 
  but dealers that count, the statistics still hold: White youths are one third 
  more likely to ahve sold drugs than Black youth, yet it is Black youth who get 
  arrested, because they are the one’s profiled, i.e., stopped because of being 
  Black. The statistics suggest that a higher arrest rate would be achieved with 
  the stopping of more Whites. Human Rights Watch puts it differently but the 
  results are the same: that whil drug use is consistent among different racial 
  groups, those arrested and prosceuted and given logn sentences are mostly Blacks 
  and Hispanics. One statistical report falls as follows: 13% of all drug users 
  are Black, 35% of those arrested for possession are Black, 55% of those convicted 
  are Black, and 74% of those sent to prison are Black. </p>
<p>Ever since slave days, when Blacks had to carry papers identifying who they 
  were for all were stopped if they were not where they were supposed to be. Generation 
  after generation we teach our kids to beware of racial profiling, how to avoid 
  it by avoiding high White areas, and what to do if stopped. You can’t tell if 
  a White kids “belongs” in a neighborhood but a Black kids is assumed not to 
  belong. And that is the heart of our problem in America today. Too many assume 
  we still don’t belong. In Constitutional language, it’s called “equal protection 
  under the law.” The basic principle of justice inour legal system is that all 
  citizens are treated equally, with action not taken without “probable cause” 
  other than race or age or ethnicy. These three categories are not crimes. Police 
  - community mediation currently occuring is in part due to the social cost of 
  alienation caused by police who act on single class (race) profiling. </p>
<p>In my book, Chapter 8, I write about the war on drugs as a war on young Black 
  men. Take away the drug stops on the highways and you’d virtually end racial 
  profiling. Do police put up road blocks to search the cars of Whites in order 
  to find embezzlers or Enron/Adelphia/WorldCom criminals? In this scenario every 
  rich White should be stopped. Think about it. If police stopped Whites the Whites 
  would rise up against it. Their protest would end it. Black protests don’t end 
  their being stopped. Think about it. Add the “asset forfeiture” law which those 
  without means can’t afford to fight in court (money taken that “could” have 
  been used to by drugs is kept, etc.) and you have a tremendous incentive for 
  police to behave this way. Think about it. </p>
<p>Finally, despite all the protestations of lost civil liberties to WHITES as 
  a result of the Homeland Security Patriot law, it is minor compared to the lost 
  civil liberties of Blacks from profiling, an act that adds even more incidents 
  of harrassment to the Black community. Think about it. </p>
<p>Finally, where statistical variations exist, profiling makes sense. If Blacks 
  represent 15% of the population but commit 50% of the robberies or 40% of the 
  murders, for instance, then racial profiling makes sense. The police, however, 
  have to make this case before doing so “just because” of race. Everyone wants 
  to walk their neighborhood streets safely, whether day time or night time. Any 
  procedure to make streets safer, including appropriate profiling (not just race 
  but other known factors), then no one will complain. The police have not yet 
  made that case. And until they do we will remain ever vigilant and ever opposed.

<p><strong>Blog #183. October 10, 2003: The Black rubber hit the Black road on 
  Election Day and has lain there ever since</strong></p>
<p>Since the Mayor took office there has been no increase in Blacks in elite units 
  (intelligence units, drug units, homicide). With the level of violence going 
  on, and that’s a public safety issue, especially in terms of crimes of color 
  on color (with Blacks, Hispanics, Asians gunned down on the streets or gunning 
  down each other). St. Paul has been cited as one of the top departments in the 
  United States for solving 16 of 16 homicides. What about the Minneapolis homicide 
  unit? The White media claims to want to know what Black officers are thinking. 
  What for? Police are police are police. They all want to enforce the laws. The 
  only difference between Black and White officers is that one group gets hired 
  and promoted willingly and the other group get hired begrudgingly and begrudgingly 
  promoted. There is no “Black think” that makes Black officers different. And 
  as any other employee in any other work force where one or more groups are singled 
  out for non-hiring and non-promotion, you don’t have to ask what they think. 
  Just ask yourself how you would think if you were part of a group that had few 
  hires, few promotions, and were frozen out of the counsels of discussion and 
  decision making as in the advisory panel regarding hiring a new chief. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #182. October 9, 2003: “Black face” in minstrel shows is still 
  alive and well in urban Black face stereotypes </strong></p>
<p>This is to continue the discussion of Don Samuels presentation in the Jordan 
  neighborhood about violence in our community at http://www.usfamily.net/web/mirth/violence.html 
  (see also Blog entries #146, 154). Although Don is correct in saying that most 
  African Americans don’t live in ghettoes and most don’t live as shown in entertainment 
  videos, he then adds his own false stereotype. A few years ago, when Whoppi 
  Goldberg was living with White actor Ted Danson of “Cheers” fame, he showed 
  up in Black face at a banquet. Whether you were amused or not is not the issue. 
  “Face” is the issue. Don doesn’t like, and I concur, that society is not served 
  by making the inner city Black youth the face of all African Americans. But 
  then Don again misses the point and adds another myth on top of that when he 
  says that African Americans have learned not to complain and thus don’t do anything 
  to correct this distortion. Here Don shows why there is a difference between 
  Black descendents of slaves and Black immigrants, the latter of which think 
  the former are making too much out of too little. Don: please, read my book. 
  Read the Spokesman-Recorder and City Pages. Stop reading the Strib. We complain 
  often and loudly. Its just that if a tree falls in the woods and the tourists 
  are deaf, no sound will be heard. The Star Tribune refuses to address and report 
  our problems. The only place that really gets it right is this web site and 
  the Spokesman-Recorder. Sometimes Insight News does and sometimes One Nation 
  News does. And only seldom does the Star Tribune, as in its major stories like 
  its 1991 series on racism. City Pages often gets it right and indeed has recently 
  commented on how Black Council Member Natalie Johnson-Lee “has had to fend for 
  herself, championing her causes to deaf ears in dreary council committee meetings. 
  She heads the council&#8217;s Health and Human Services Committee, where most issues 
  challenging blacks in this city&#8212;poverty, civil rights&#8212;tend to fall. But the 
  committee&#8217;s agendas are usually treated as an afterthought by most of Johnson 
  Lee&#8217;s colleagues” (see http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1186/article11458.asp). 
  Here again, Don has accurately pointed out that these issues are treated as 
  “afterthoughts” is indeed what is going on. But then he doesn’t have the solution. 
  I would love for Don to champion the solutions in my book, once he has read 
  it, which are summarized and added to in my “7 Solutions” piece in the Solution Papers section of this web site.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #181. October 9, 2003: Reverse discrimination: Whites are more 
  violent, Blacks think small</strong></p>
<p>Continuing the discussion of Don Samuels presentation in the Jordan neighborhood 
  about violence in our community (see http://www.usfamily.net/web/mirth/violence.html 
  and Blog entries #146, 154). At the same meeting Don said that most Black on 
  Black crime involves only one to two people, but that to shoot a whole school, 
  like Columbine, takes the kind of big thinking that kids from the African American 
  community do not do. This is ludicrous. First of all, the number of kids shot 
  as a result of “big thinking” in schools, all but one having been by White kids, 
  is small and miniscule, as tragic as they are, compared to the number of Blacks 
  killed in American inner cities each year. Don is again thinking like both a 
  White man and an immigrant. Nothing wrong with either. But as I have written 
  before (see especially Blog entry #24 as well as #s25, 27, 35-36, 40, 62), we 
  won’t get anywhere without evidence and reasoning grounded in facts. </p>

  need spawned by neglecting to meet the needs of learing and education. Is it 
  another White guilt assuagement program offering a few Blacks some jobs, or 
  it it something real that can help our young African American men? </strong></p>
<p>You want a workable solution? See my “7 Solutions” paper under the Solution Papers section of this web site and check out especially the section under Solution 
  #2: jobs. The social services programs at Pilot City will be wiped out with 
  full control going to the medical facility (hey, that’s where the insurance 
  money, private and government is). It will be interesting to see the results 
  of their experimental medicine projects on the folks of North Minneapolis. It 
  looks like the old empire is dead, long live the empire, as a new one is being 
  built. Musical chairs. But where is the music for our young men? Although a 
  forgiveness program of public service in exchange for wiping out traffic tickets 
  was somewhat helpful to some, the real need is for what Archbishop Tutu headed 
  in South Africa: a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (or a set of Sullivan 
  Principles for Minneapolis): and that requires not a day of good works but a 
  system than enables a career of work with livable wages. Where better to start 
  than the contract system of Minneapolis which was to provide inner city Blacks 
  with jobs but instead provided jobs for Whites to build prisons to house Blacks 
  (see my Chapter 9). It is sad, because most of the stories I hear is that nothing 
  is really going on there, despite the occasional pieces the Strib runs to the 
  contrary. Is the Africa American Mens’ Project going the way of the Synagen 
  Project when it hit its negative turning point? So what’s happening? Jobs of 
  Black professional men are being wiped out while Black women are allowed to 
  keep their jobs, creating more division within the community, even at the professional 
  levels. There have been radio programs out of Washington D.C. reporting the 
  lack of jobs for professional Black men in this country right now. Hence my 
  statement that we need a double header: charity indeed begins at home. It may 
  well be necessary to shoulder the burden of rebuilding Iraq but not at the expense 
  of ignoring and not rebuilding our inner cities and provide jobs for our own 
  people as well. </p>

  come down to the courthouse and sit and hear what is going to be said and the 
  arguments that are going to be made. We have exclusively reported, and no one 
  has repudiated what we have exclusively reported, that the Housing certificates 
  are in trouble and gone. Hollman is a disaster in many ways, environmental, 
  vouchers, mobility certificates, misspent funds, gentrification for Whites rather 
  than replacements for Blacks, delayed and delayed, and a whole host of other 
  ways (see Chapter 8 of my book). </p>
<p>The Minneapolis Commission on Civil Rights Public Relations and Education Committee 
  held a meeting last week, which is supposed to have nine members, including 
  the Chairperson. It could not achieve a quorum. I know. I was there. Civil Rights 
  remains a Minneapolis after thought. Bob Boyd was there to “fix” the system 
  to say there is no problem. He had no documentation. I cited the documents I 
  have used on this web site. He could not refute one problem area we raised. 
  One word for Hollman: turmoil. </p>
<p>And what about the $300,000 Legal Aid’s Thompson (see my Blog entry #134) discussed 
  putting into the hands of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund? (See my Column 
  #12). Can anyone tell me what that fund is? No one at that meeting could. And 
  what is the status of the “special master” Thompson spoke of (which I had suggested 
  August 29, 1999 to the Judge; see my Column #12). So we have to ask again, “where 
  is the leadership” besides collecting their pay checks and waiting for tax payer 
  paid pensions? Where is the leadership as our people suffer in the areas of 
  housing, public safety, education, etc. Where’s the beef? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #178. October 7, 2003: Rush Limbaugh was malicious and was allowed 
  to play the race card</strong></p>
<p>See Blog numbers 166, 170, 173, 176. As Rush quit this is not meant to beat 
  a dead horse but rather talk about the real issue Rush discussed that is not 
  getting attention. First of all, some have said that however wrong he was, he 
  didn’t mean to be malicious. Are you kidding? Of course he was. Remember, he 
  didn’t limit it to just Donnavon McNabb. McNabb was just his door opener. He 
  said it about all Black coaches and Black players. An ESPN spokesman said he 
  didn’t think they were racially biased? Think? Think? This is not a maybe maybe 
  not issue. It was or it was not. Of course it was racially biased. Listen to 
  the words again: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Sorry to say this, I don’t think he’s (McNabb) been that good from the get-go. 
    I think what we’ve had here is a little social concern in theNFL. The media 
    has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well, black coaches and 
    black quarterbacks doing well&#8230;McNabb&#8230;got a lot of credit for the 
    performance of this team that he didn’t deserve. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several Black columnists have picked up on the “social concern” issue which, 
  as we know, is about Black leadership: “Black coaches and Black quarterbacks.” 
  Most know how good McNabb is (runner-up for the NFL MVP in 2000, three Pro Bowls, 
  led the Eagles to two straight NFC Championships) so Rush was denying talent 
  BECAUSE it is Black. Now answer me this: why, when Blacks bring up race people 
  go into a frenzy but when Limbaugh plays the race care they don’t? How can ESPN 
  possibly say that Limbaugh was hired for “his ability to express an opinion 
  and spark debate” when they allow no response to his statement and when no football 
  fan would tolerate such a statement made about a guy like McNabb who, as the 
  article admits, “is widely considered one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL? 
  McNabb “has helped turn the Eagles from a laughingstock franchise into a perennial 
  championship contender.” Thus, “the Eagles wouldn’t have won consecutive NFC 
  East titles without him.” </p>
<p>So, that leaves us with the leadership issue. The quarterbacks are too dumb 
  argument has been laid to rest. So what is left? Black coaches. And owners like 
  to take their coaches to their country clubs. That is the rub. That is what 
  makes me wonder if this isn’t part of something more sinister in the ongoing 
  racial clashes caused by those with resentment about “dumb Blacks” getting undeserved 
  leadership positions. Where is the owner ready to break the country club color 
  barrier the way Jackie Robinson’s owner broke the color barrier in baseball. 
  In the meantime, the inmates keep running the asylum. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #177. October 6, 2003: Limbaugh’s new definition of anger: people 
  can’t see his truth. He won’t admit he himself is blind</strong></p>
<p>See Blog numbers 166, 170, 173, and 176. On his radio show, Limbaugh said “All 
  this has become the tempest that it is because I must have been right about 
  something. If I wasn’t righ, there wouldn’t be this cacophy of outrage that 
  has sprung up in the sports writer community.” </p>
<p>To believe people get mad because they are angry you are right is a real stretch. 
  And to say the anger is only in the sports writer community when it is also 
  across the fan base, the players and coaches, and everyone else who isn’t a 
  closet Confederate sympathiser. Our founding fathers were mad at the British 
  for their tyranny and taxation. Does that mean Washington and Jefferson and 
  Franklin were wrong? Americans were angry after Pearl Harbor and the World Trade 
  Center. Does that mean they were wrong? I sounds as if Rush Limbaugh has been 
  listenting to his own PR to much and smoking his cigars without any ventilation 
  while in a glue factory. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #176. October 5, 2003: Rush Limbaugh’s comment that “black coaches 
  and black players&#8221; aren’t as qualified disqualifies him</strong></p>
<p>See Blog numbers 166, 170, 173. The ESPN response to Limbaugh questioning the 
  ability of “Black coaches and players” was to say that their commentators are 
  “football experts” and thus they didn’t want them to respond as “media observers.” 
  No matter what they say, they can’t hide the fact that his comments shows how 
  terribly unqualified Limbaugh is. There isn’t a fantasy football player in this 
  country who wouldn’t be happy having Donnovan McNabb. And the two Black Coaches 
  last year? Both made the playoffs. And why the shot by Limbaugh at “Black coaches” 
  unless it is really eating in his craw. I don’t buy ESPN’s statement that Limbaugh 
  did not make “a politically motivated comment. This is a sports and media argument.” 
  Say what? Is Shapiro as hopelessly ignorant as Limbaugh? Of course it was politically 
  motivated, motivated by racism and a desire not to have Black coaches in White 
  country clubs. If there is one place in American society where merit and merit 
  only counts, its the NFL. How can an ESPN spokesman not know this? How can Shapiro 
  say this without gagging on his own words? Do these people have no sense of 
  personal shame, no personal integrity or honor for themselves? How can they 
  expect to keep an audience once they realize they are being played for fools? 
  Let’s call it like it is: how many teams don’t want Black head coaches because 
  they don’t feel they will fit into their White country clubs? They will, if 
  they’ll lead the way. What are they afraid of? </p>

<p>People have asked me about Doug Grow’s column (see Blog entries #167 and 171) 
  and what it means. The most interesting question I’ve gotten is “have they snapped?” 
  Followed by, “what are they up to? Why does the Strib attack on you?” (as no 
  one believes Doug Grow could write without either editorial approval or direction). 
  Before he wrote that column, he called me to say people were wanting to know 
  “what will it take to satisfy Ron Edwards?” I, of course saw through his rhetorical 
  question steeped in BS and racism. I asked him “what issues are you talking 
  about that I would be satisfied on?” He had no response. Why? Because he doesn’t 
  know the issues. So he writes about my alledged “blistering at the suggestion 
  that he is holding back the organization” and badly defeated in the last election 
  111-22. We never discussed my feelings. So he is writing hearsay. What I longed 
  have maintained is that it was fixed, rigged, and stolen. I can prove it. The 
  national and local NAACP know it. They just haven’t figured out how to wiggle 
  out of it as they colluded in it. The Strib, through Doug Grow and his column 
  is thus practicing jaunticed journalism. Or call it selective journalism. Whatever 
  you call it, it doesn’t stand without adjectives as just “journalism.” </p>
<p>October 1st reflected a disastrous day for what is happening in this town for 
  people of color. If only the Strib would be objective regarding the discussion. 
  They are dismissing people like me if we aren’t elected/appointed (chosen) and 
  don’t know what to do with citizens like myself who force their way into the 
  otherwise excluding process. It is time that people concernd about NAACP, Hollman, 
  School Board and other issues to sit down with the Strib Board to discuss these 
  issues. How else to reduce the tension and start something positive out of their 
  negative journalism? </p>
<p>I do appreciate Doug Grow holding me responsible for all the problems in Black 
  Minnesota (and maybe Black America) although local Black folks don’t buy that. 
  Too much history, too much is known. The good news is that by focussing on me 
  we may now be able to get closer to calling a “family meeting” of Minneapolis 
  Whites and Blacks to discuss the 7 Solutions piece and begin our work of reconciliation 
  so we can work together to solve problems left too long unsolved by both the 
  White establishment and too many of the so-called Black leadership, the former 
  because they like the status quo, the latter because they don’t think the status 
  quo can be changed. I believe. I believe we can change the status quo. I believe 
  we can find the common ground. I believe we can be reconciled as citizens of 
  a great city in a great state in a great nation. We have to start somewhere. 
  Why not with my 7 Solutions piece? </p>
<p>The Strib has gone from endorse anyone but Ron Edward, or how else are we going 
  to keep them in their place, to finally inviting me to the table. This doesn’t 
  mean that their investing a lot to identify the “right Negroes” was a waste 
  of time, because we are now all involved. I welcome any opportunity to sit down 
  to discuss this with the Strib board. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #174. October 4, 2003: The NAACP: Gallmon’s departure continues 
  the NAACP trend of placing its light under a bushel rather than making it a 
  beacon on the hill. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Comment 3 of 3</strong></p>
<p>See Blog entries 165 and 169. The leadership of the NAACP branch is the same 
  as any organization: it is not the <bwho /> that counts but the <what /> and 
  the how. What will the NAACP stand for? How will they pursue the civil rights 
  goals they have so long turned their backs on in Minneapolis? How will they 
  reach out to the full community, Black and White? Needed is leadership that 
  invites everyone to the table to discuss our common goals and our different 
  ideas on how to achieve them. That and only that will give the NAACP relevance. 
  Sadly, it appears that the new leadership will engage in the same hidden and 
  back room dealings until the national NAACP rules on the last stolen election. 
  If the national does nothing, the local will do nothing different. If the national 
  overturns the false election, and calls for new and open and honest elections, 
  then, and only then, will there be hope to achieve our potential. Will the national 
  and local branch practice the ubuntu philosophy of reconciliation (see Blog 
  entries 163, 164, and 172) or continued its practice of division and segregation?

<p><strong>Blog #173. October 4, 2003: More reflections on Rush Limbaugh: Which 
  troops does he support, Whites, Blacks, or both? </strong></p>
<p>With America’s sons and daughters of color dying in Iraq in a stalled war close 
  to an election year, Rush Limbaugh has only added to the tensions with his gratuitous 
  comments (see Blog entries #166 and #170). I remember visiting in Kansas City 
  over 20 some years ago and hearing the then young talk show host on the radio, 
  and I remember asking my family, “who is this” in the heartland of the Klan 
  and different right wing paramilitary groups. I listened, I laughed, I shook 
  my head. I told my family “this cat has got potential” because he had been up 
  in Bethany, Missouri with “The Amy of God” and other groups. He could be a danger 
  not only to Black America but to the good folks in White America as well, for, 
  as Yoda says in Star Wars, “Once you start down the dark path, forever will 
  it dominate your destiny.” For three days after his comments Sunday America’s 
  better angels were silent. And then America’s better angels woke up, spoke their 
  piece, and he was gone. Was this censorship? Of course not. Do you want “free 
  speech” practiced in the schools, where any one of any hate group or prejudiced 
  group can come in and spout such nonsense in front of your kids? Of course not. 
  The NFL is beloved by all age groups. The NFL and ESPN have a responsibility 
  to the children of America. Let Rush have his radio show, let him appear on 
  interview shows, etc., but lets leave political views (whether liberal or conservative) 
  out of the picture of the one institution left in America today that can unite 
  people: sports. We need at least one place that is not politicized. Let’s keep 
  it that way. Rush is a bright, talented man, and he uses his skills and abilities 
  to the fullest. When he is entertaining, there are few better. When he is advocating, 
  whether you agree or not, there are few better. But at that moment on ESPN, 
  he was a spokesman for both the NFL and for President George W. Bush. He is 
  so glib I thought he would take his race shots more cleverly, more disguised, 
  more in code. But that Dr. Strangelove response of his was not going to be denied. 
  He even said he planned it the night before, as he told a broadcasters’ group 
  Wednesday night. And when he spoke, it doesn’t matter whether or not the Black 
  participants were told to respond, for, as Donovan McNabb said, once someone 
  puts that out there, it’s the responsibility of those in the discussion to challenge 
  it and not let it pass as something they, the Blacks, agree with. Someone should 
  have had the honesty, understanding, and courage to say, “Rush, that’s so far 
  off base it’s ridiculous, man.” When a man brings you into a controversy a real 
  man speaks up, and does not remain quiet, as if pacified, for whatever reason. 
</p>
<p>This was not new to me. I had commented several years ago on one of my TV shows 
  that Rush uses the arena of sports entertainment to advance some of his doctrines. 
  That’s OK. All of us do. Just keep that kind of stuff off the airways when our 
  children are watching and listening and learning from he responses of the adults 
  they see on TV. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #172. October 4, 2003: Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s 
  “Ubunto Theology of Reconciliation, ”</strong></p>
<p><strong> Part 3 of 3</strong></p>
<p>Here I let the Kirkus Review of Archbishop Tutu’s book, No Future Without Forgiveness, 
  speak in this third statement (emphasis added): </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>No Future Witout Forgiveness is the “&#8230;story of South Africa&#8217;s 
    Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a meditation on evil and forgiveness 
    from Nobel laureate Tutu ( <i>The Rainbow People of God: The Making of a Peaceful 
    Revolution, </i> 1994). In 1994, South Africa faced a historically unique 
    situation. A long-oppressed majority had peacefully taken power from its minority 
    oppressor. As Tutu explains, the question facing the nation was, What then 
    to do? Should Nuremberg-like trials be held against those who had maintained 
    the ghastly system of apartheid? Or, as many whites wished, should the past 
    be forgotten, let bygones be bygones? The new regime found what Tutu calls 
    &#8220;a third way&#8221; to deal with the past: the TRC. Those who had committed 
    politically motivated crimes during the apartheid era would receive amnesty 
    if they made full and truthful public disclosures. In turn, the victims of 
    such acts would be allowed to tell their stories in the hopes that this would 
    restore a measure of their human dignity. Over 18 months some 20,000 victims 
    appeared before the commission, imparting their tales of personal anguish—of 
    torture, rape, imprisonment—but also exposing a system perpetrated and supported 
    by the highest levels of government, military, and police. No longer could 
    anyone deny knowledge of the past, as so many whites had; never again would 
    such an evil be allowed to exist in South Africa. Yet it would be not only 
    supporters of apartheid answering for their deeds. Those who had committed 
    crimes in the fight against the system, including Winnie Mandela, would answer 
    for their acts as well. Tutu&#8217;s writing on this process is nothing short 
    of miraculous. He is strong in his defense of the commission that so many 
    doubted as either too harsh or too lenient. He is also anguished by the depths 
    of human depravity the commission hearings revealed, but passionately hopeful 
    that human caring and unity might prevail, in South Africa and the world. 
    [a] sober depiction and searing indictment of evil and [a] never-maudlin advocacy 
    of love.” </p>

<p><strong><a name="03171b1003"></a>Blog #171. October 3, 2003: Why do Doug Grow and the Strib Commit Journalism 
  Mal-Practice? </strong></p>
<p>Why are we back in the “here we go again” mode? In Blog entry #141, I invited 
  Doug Grow and the Star Tribune to adopt journalistic integrity as their standard. 
  But instead of maintaining journalistic vigilance they commit journalistic malpractice. 
  In Blog entries #37, 117, 127, 140-141, I wrote about information that I gave 
  to the Strib and three of its reporters, information they declined to use despite 
  the fact that it was genuine news. I’m reminded of the news organizations that 
  said they held back in Iraq from telling everything because they were afraid 
  if the world heard the truth they would want to go to war with Iraq and they 
  were waging peace. Why not wage journalism? So what are Doug Grow and the Strib 
  waging by their withholding of information?. In his October 1st column, he again 
  leaves out significant news that I gave to him. He slanted his article against 
  me and others, blaming me for the woes of the NAACP. He left out that I had 
  testified before the special NAACP board of inquiry on September 6th and that 
  I was thus aware of who was involved in the conspiracy between local, regional, 
  and national NAACP persons to steal the election, as attested to in the affidavit 
  given by the Rev. Gale Ford’s wife (he is the Regional Director of the NAACP) 
  to the national NAACP in April 2003 <br>
  <br>
  Now Doug, why don’t you believe me? Why did you then have to try to call Shayla 
  Lindsey Wednesday morning, about 8:30 am, in Denver, Colorado? She wasn’t in. 
  Or maybe your reputation proceeded you so that when they heard your name they 
  didn’t put you through. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? I wonder: couldn’t you 
  verify with the local branch, or the national, or with the Rocky Mountain News? 
  Or were you trying to alert her to something she already knew about: that I 
  knew what was in the divorce proceedings (finalized two months ago), for which 
  she was a major reasons. Of course one of the questions I have is what other 
  level of involvement does Shayla Lindsey have with Rev. Ford in terms of the 
  investigation being done on him by the Rocky Mountain News. Why is this important? 
  Because it shows the levels of intrigue and betrayal of the NAACP at the highest 
  levels locally, regionally, and nationally, that have nothing to do with me, 
  and yet you, Doug, write your column as if all would be well with the world 
  of the NAACP if it wasn’t for me. This is, purely and simply, journalistic malpractice. 
  So again, I repeat my earlier invitation: for you and the Strib to adopt journalistic 
  integrity as your norm. Come and let us do journalism integrity together.<br>

<p><strong>Blog #170. October 3, 2003: Rush Limbaugh’s crack block on all NFL 
  Black players and coaches as an ESPN commentator was as cowardly as it was purposeful 
  and intentional<br>
  </strong><br>
  In Blog #166, I quote Rush Limbaugh’s statement that Black players and coaches 
  get ahead in the NFL because they get preferential treatment because they are 
  Black, not because they are particularly good. My experience in broadcasting 
  spans several decades (I currently have my own show, “Black Focus,” on MTN-TV 
  Channel 17 in Minneapolis (airs Sundays at 5 pm). So I know what the terms mean. 
  In the USA Today article, it called them Limbaugh’s “unscripted remarks.” Remember 
  the early controversy: would he bring his politics into the game. We were all 
  assured he would not. It would be all football (like FDR’s card games: all cards; 
  he allowed no politics to be discussed). So no one was prepared to debate politics. 
  And because he was unscripted, he knew no one would be prepared for a response. 
  Even sideline reporters are scripted; even their “and now back to you in the 
  booth upstairs” is scripted. The article noted the sideline reporters have their 
  own producers. So you know this is telling us this program is very tightly controlled. 
  Only a coward attacks people knowing they can’t fight back or that no one around 
  is allowed to respond (what over possible explanation is there for Michael Irwin 
  and Tom Jackson remaining mum and even Steve Young letting it pass?). They were 
  told to. As the article said, “ESPN officials chose not to have Jackson, Irvin 
  and Young respond.” That is what I mean by puppet makers. Rush gets his freedom 
  of speech, but the plantation players don’t. What other interpretation is there? 
  So by doing that ESPN showed it either lied or didn’t really care when it said 
  that in terms of Limbaugh’s political viewpoints, they “promised he [Limbaugh] 
  wouldn’t espouse” them. So Limbaugh opened up a racial can of worms. He also 
  pulled the curtain back exposing the ugliness of his viewpoint and his own incredible 
  ignorance of football. Again, as he mentioned both black coaches and black quarterbacks 
  I have to wonder if there is another agenda here. So far we don’t know. But 
  those of us in Minnesota are particularly sensitive to this issue. Maybe ESPN 
  and the NFL is willing to let Rush slide, but as an American who believes everyone 
  should be invited to society’s banquet table and not resent the others who are 
  there, I cannot let it slide. Stay tuned. I will continue to connect the dots 
  for you on this as I do on all the topics discussed in this web log. ESPN and 
  the NFL must stand up and be counted on this or else be exposed for holding 
  to a double standard. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #169. October 3, 2003: The NAACP: Gallmon’s departure continues 
  the NAACP trend of placing its light under a bushel rather than making it a 
  beacon on the hill. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Comment 2 of 3<br>
  </strong><br>
  Gallmon or not Gallmon, it doesn’t make much difference, as the current leadership 
  of the branch relies are all cut from the same cloth: they use such word nostrums 
  as “potential” and “hope” and “beacon” while taking actions that delay potential, 
  extinguish hope, and put out the light of truth. Gallmon is a minister. On of 
  the Bible’s verses is to let your light shine (beacon) and not hide it under 
  a bushel (closed door meetings, secret meetings, not release information, even 
  to the membership). And yet the actions of the NAACP branch have been just that: 
  hiding, failing to stand up for its objectives, failing to follow its own rules, 
  and failing to keep its eye on the prize. </p>
<p>They seek darkness, not light, separation and segregation not integration and 
  common ground. At the recent Missouri state meeting of the NAACP he called my 
  book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” and myself, “cancers that had 
  to be removed.” And herein lies the problem with the NAACP locally and nationally. 
  They forget the wisdom of Archbishop Desmond Tutu that “a person is a person 
  through other persons,” that there is “no future without forgiveness,” and that 
  “to forgive is indeed the best form of self-interest.” In this, the heart of 
  spirituality, love and forgiveness, the heart and soul of what Jesus said was 
  all of our mandates: to love and serve, the Rev. Gallmon and the entire Black 
  ministerial alliance of Minneapolis have turned their back, keeping the NAACP 
  light under a bushel, unleashing not the healing balm of love and reconciliation 
  but the destructive wedges of hate and resentment. Therefore, it makes us wonder 
  again, just what is it that don’t they want us to see? <br>
  <br>
  My book is published under the name of “Beacon on the Hill Press.” A beacon 
  on the hill shines light on everything, good and bad, clean and dirty. This 
  NAACP refuses to do so. This the Black churches in Minneapolis refuse to do. 
  My book shines the light on the good and the bad of the NAACP as well as on 
  the good and bad of the discriminating and prejudiced city of Minneapolis. Truth 
  is truth, regardless of color. The NAACP leadership no longer fights the good 
  fight of civil rights; instead it has turned the NAACP into a den of righteous 
  thieves. My commitment is to continue to shine the light of a beacon of truth, 
  and to shine a light that seeks to provide the warmth of reconciliation. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #168. October 3, 2003: Is Alfred Flowers a Deep Pass from Rybak 
  to Gallmon’s NAAGP (the National Association for the Advancement of Gallmon’s 
  People)?</strong></p>
<p>Even though Al Gallmon has resigned, the local branch process and way of behaving 
  has not changed. So let’s look at what happened on Saturday, September 27, 2003: 
  a general meeting was held by the NAACP at the Urban League. Gallmon, as see, 
  didn’t want the meeting to take place. He had to cancel it. This was an open 
  meeting for the membership. Alfred Flowers was a member in good standing eligible, 
  as all members, to attend. He doesn’t even get a chance to enter the building. 
  Albert Gallmon called the cops to throw Flowers out for trespassing and fighting. 
  Before he could enter the cops handcuffed him and then beat him. The witnesses 
  all say the Gallmon charges are false. Witnesses say the cops were upon him 
  immediately after getting out of their cars. No questions were asked. They seemed 
  to know who to get and what to do to him. So why was Flowers put in the hospital? 
  As I do in my book, I will connect the dots for you. worked with Communities 
  United Against Police Brutality. Flowers has been involved with police-community 
  mediation. Flowers was involved in the Hollman environmental investigation by 
  citizens. The NAACP was to vote on whether to support the city’s motions in 
  court related to Heritage Park funding: the members opposed, President Gallmon 
  was for. The NAACP was to censure the executive committee for sacking the Housing 
  Chair, Lisa Clemons who was investigating the Heritage Park funding gap problem. 
  Gallmon wanted to avoid doing so. The NAACP was to take a position on the hiring 
  of David Jennings as Superintendent, which the members oppose and President 
  Gallmon supports. Continue to connect the dots: Who would benefit the most by 
  ending the NAACP meeting? Gallmon. Who would gain most by interfering with Flowers’ 
  important work in the community? Rybak. How do you cover an unbalanced White 
  woman shooting two White men at the Hennepin County Government Center? Arrest 
  Black men. Connect the dots and you get advance coordination and approval. Can 
  there be any doubt in the Mayor’s involvement in okaying this type of activity, 
  given he has remained mute since it happened? What message did these two self-proclaimed 
  and elected leaders, Gallmon and Rybak, really send?</p>

<p><strong><a name="03167b1002"></a>Blog #167. October 2, 2003: Response to Doug Grow question for Mpls.Forum 
  Issues list: “Can Edwards be PART of something if not chosen to LEAD something?”</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>[October 1, 2003 on Minneapolis Forum:] I know Doug Mann is the main person 
    scolding the NAACP leadership, but I doubt he can make a case that NAACP MUST 
    represent only opinion from the poor neighborhoods of Minneapolis. Because 
    at least one of the council members from the Northside seems more in keeping 
    with the NAACP leadership than with Ron Edwards. The fact that he was elected 
    indicates he has strong support from the very victims of discrimination for 
    which Edwards wants to be a spokesman. I think the real question is: Can Edwards 
    be PART of something if not chosen to LEAD that something? </p>
  <p>[October 1, 2003, Doug Grow in Star Tribune:] The name Ron Edwards always 
    comes up when the [NAACP] chapter’s internal woes are discussed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the writer of the October 1, 2003 post to the Minneapolis 
  Forum issues list has not read my book nor does he understand Doug Grow’s column, 
  nor does he understand the NAACP nor the term “field hand.” Nor does the person 
  who thanked Doug “for separating the good Negroes from the bad Negroes.” I’ve 
  been trying to explain this for over 40 years. I have explained it all in my 
  book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” but people continue to comment 
  without having read the book. I would appreciate it if someone would pass this 
  on to that Issues List. </p>
<p>I agree with the column title: “Doug Grow: NAACP chapter needs direction,” 
  although it would have been better to say: “Community agrees:” rather than make 
  it a &#8220;Doug Grow:” thing.</p>
<p>Grow says that ‘Internal politics are brutal.” To be sure. And I’m sure he 
  finds that true at the Strib when he, as the community writer, has to participate 
  in the black balling of my book. Whether he agrees with it or not isn’t the 
  point. Either way he has gone along with it, the &#8220;it,&#8221; in his word, they’re 
  “shelving” it. But it is incorrect to lay the NAACP’s woes at my feet. I only 
  deal with the problems as I have found them. Doug Mann has done a great job 
  of laying them out as well, as have the courts. Doug Grow used to over the years. 
  But that has changed during the last year. Doug Grow’s column yesterday is payback 
  time for himself and others. They don’t mind attacking me in print but they 
  won’t give me equal time. So be it. Note: he is careful in his article not to 
  mention my book so people could hear from me rather than through his and the 
  Strib&#8217;s filters. So, please understand this background. </p>
<p>My fight has never been with individuals. My fight is not with Doug Grow. It 
  is with the Strib. My fight has been with the results of organizations who have 
  taken their eyes off the prize. I’ve taken Doug Grow and the Strib to task in 
  this blog (see entries #153, 139, 140, 127, 17, 02, 101, 100, 96, 64, 93, 92, 
  76, 70, 67, 58, 52, 48, 43, 37, 36, 32, 41, 30, 2) because of their reporting 
  in general, and, in a few entries, regarding their efforts to stifle debate 
  and discussion by refusing to review or acknowledge my book. They have a right 
  to condemn it. They don’t have a right, as a newspaper, to censor the news. 
  I doubt they have read all of it although they may have read parts of it. A 
  book covering 40 years of experience about Minneapolis is news. News that is 
  fit to print. Or at last to review, condemn, and point out the errors, so their 
  readers can decide rather than have newspaper nanny overseers. And if I’m such 
  a thorn in the side of Minneapolis, what better way to demonstrate how terrible 
  I am than to write a review exposing the fraud in my book. But they won’t. Because 
  they can’t. They don’t dare. Because then they would expose themselves. Because 
  the book is truth from first page to last page. Open it to any page and start 
  reading. You’ll be riveted. And you’ll know why the Strib and the NAACP fear 
  the book. It used to be a capital offense for Blacks to read and write. So I 
  understand the Strib wanting to continue the tradition of deciding what we should 
  and should not read. But when our own people censor our own writers, that is 
  very troubling to me. Is it troubling to you too? </p>
<p>When the national NAACP held its hearing here earlier this month, Gallmon said 
  I was banned because of what I wrote in my book (think, now, readers, just how 
  far we have not come when ideas are not allowed the light of day), but when 
  asked what I wrote he could not answer what it was in the book that was so bad, 
  and had to take a 10 minute recess to pull some quotes together. When he read 
  them the audience nodded in agreedment with what I wrote that he quoted. So 
  he was not independent. And he did not fall on his sword with grace. His co-conspirator 
  in the stolen election, Rev. Gale Ford, NAACP Regional Director, said recently 
  at the Missouri state conference that people like me and my book are like cancers 
  that need to be eradicated. Please understand what the national NAACP and local 
  branch and Gallmon have known but won’t so far acknowledge: Gallmon participated 
  with the regional head of the NAACP and people at the national NAACP to rig 
  the election, including disqualifying those who voted for me (after complaining 
  about Florida). The national NAACP has lost its way. Read my paper on that in 
  the Solution Papers section of this web site. </p>
<p>And yes, there is a philosophical difference, but it is not about field hands 
  being the only leaders. “Field hands” refers to a state of mind, an attitude. 
  It refers to those who are the workers for the people. Many in the Congressional 
  Black caucus are field hands. Many high level Blacks in corporations and on 
  major professional athletic teams are field hands in that they seek to do good 
  for our community. The term only makes sense in contrast to the other term: 
  the banana heads, a term which Doug Grow conveniently leaves out of his story. 
  The banana heads were the Blacks who lived in the Slave Master’s house and often 
  were designated to carry out orders over and sometimes against the Blacks in 
  the field. They are the ones called “the good Negroes.” The reason there are 
  less than 500 members out of a potential 100,000 in Minneapolis is because many 
  of the middle and upper middle class blacks, who consider themselves field hands, 
  working for the people, don’t want to be involved in the corruption and graft 
  of the local branch which is a wholely owned subsidiary of the DFL, just as 
  the national NAACP has made itself a subsidiary of the national Democratic Party. 
</p>
<p>But it is more than philosophy. “Field hands” is a term that is also about 
  action and results. I am proud to claim to be a Nellie Stone Johnson Democrat. 
  I say that because to say I am a DFLer would be counter to what Nellie stood 
  for in terms of what the DFL has become. The NAACP has made itself a branch 
  of the DFL. What the NAACP doesn’t like about my book is not that I have not 
  written the truth but that I have written the truth. No one has yet come forward 
  to say that anything written in my book is false. I can document everything. 
  Indeed, my weekly column is always supported by documentation. The response 
  of choice in Minneapolis has been to ignore the book and hope it goes away. 
  Others tell me the book is destined to become a classic. History will judge. 
  I sleep at night. How do Doug Grow and the Strib and people like Al Gallmon 
  and the NAACP sleep at night? </p>
<p>What I am trying to provide is leadership on issues. This is why the Seven 
  Solutions piece was written, to gather together and expand on the solution suggestions 
  in the book. What those interviewed by Doug Grow don’t realize is that he has 
  feasted on them. And he has made the entire organization look not only stupid 
  and incompetent, but hopeless, now and forever. Note how he opens and closes 
  his column:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>OPENS: The Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP has become good at one thing: 
    steady self-destruction. <br>
    CLOSES: [Succeeding Gallmon as President Brett Buckner is] saying positive 
    things about Gallmon, Little and Edwards. &#8220;We&#8217;re like a choir,&#8221; Buckner said. &#8220;Everybody sings a different part, but it&#8217;s all the same song.&#8221; Imagine, just 
    a few months ago, Gallmon was saying such harmonious things. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doug Grow has already predicted failure. Here is my prediction: the NAACP, 
  national or local, will never be successful until it embraces the ubuntu philosophy 
  of reconciliation of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (see my 3 part sequence 
  on that beginning with Blog #163 and continuing today with Blog entry #164). 
  So back to the question: yes, I can be part of something without having been 
  chosen to lead it (again, that is the sum and substance of my life as written 
  in my book). </p>
<p>However, that is not the correct question. The question is whether those at 
  the NAACP can be a part of something bigger than themselves. By that I don’t 
  mean the national NAACP. By “larger” I mean a philosophy of reconciliation (Blacks 
  with Blacks, Blacks with Whites), a purposefully pursued intentional goal (equal 
  access and equal opportunity for all in education, jobs and housing), what we 
  in the civil rights movement call keeping our eyes on the prize (to achieve 
  a status where all are invited to sit at society’s table, not just wait on it), 
  and have a working plan of action to achieve the goals sought (such as my 7 
  Solutions piece). Here is the kicker: the empirical data in my book about education, 
  housing, jobs, public safety, safe environment, governing, and ethics, as applied 
  to the inner city Blacks of the cities of America, including Minneapolis, only 
  allow one of two conclusions: these are the desired results of those in power 
  or Blacks are just too dumb to do better. Another conclusion: the NAACP has 
  not addressed these areas successfully. They say insanity is dong the same thing 
  over and over and expecting change. </p>
<p>Think about it: while Whites and immigrants have been working and building 
  wealth for a few generations or for many generations, that opportunity has been 
  denied to Blacks. First there was 300 years of slavery (without wages or the 
  ability to own property there can be nothing to pass on). Then Jim Crow (replicating 
  slavery as best they could; a study shows many who were lynched were land owners 
  whose property was then taken away). Then the 1968 Kerner Commission Report 
  said Blacks couldn’t make it on their own because they are different and thus 
  the government must take care of them. And then the 1998 book The Bell Curve 
  came to the same conclusion regarding government support because Blacks are 
  too dumb to do so on their own. I oppose both positions. I stand on my 7 Solutions 
  piece. I will willingly work with any who wish to work for the bigger picture 
  of the prize under the umbrella of seeking to reconcile all of us together and 
  find the common ground I discuss in my book. But as long as the local branch 
  is allowed, with national’s help, to rig the elections, and as long as they 
  seek expulsions rather than reconciliation, then Doug Grow’s conclusion and 
  prediction will remain correct. And then those who continually work to “keep 
  us in our place” will have won. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #166. October 2, 2003: Rush Limbaugh just became George W. Bush’s 
  tight end that fumbles and drops the ball and the NFL’s poster child for hypocrisy 
  when he Crack Blocked all NFL Black players and coaches as well as fans, Black 
  and White, on ESPN. </strong></p>
<p>This is a significant story, as it reflects my points about all not being invited 
  to the banquet table and Limbaugh’s saying Blacks are welcome only begrudgingly, 
  as if he prefers us to be waiting on the table, not sitting at it. Even though 
  he resigned, the story offers us a chance to explore these issues of choice: 
  segregation or integration, exclusion or reconciliation </p>
<p> “USA Today” has posted two interesting articles that could significantly effect 
  the 2004 election plans of the Republicans to garner Black voters. At 12:17 
  am, ESPN posted Limbaugh fumbles the ball, and ESPN fails to recover. Twelve 
  hours later, at 12:48 pm and updated at 2:47 pm, indicating this is a hot story, 
  USA Today posted ESPN backs Limbaugh in wake of McNabb remarks.</p>
<p> These were not slips of the tongue. Yesterday on his show in the morning he 
  said that the hubbub was proof that he was correct (can you imagine, arguing 
  that because people don&#8217;t agree with you it prooves you are correct?). Later 
  in the afternoon he resigned from his &#8220;dream job&#8221; at ESPN. Then later the same 
  evning last night, after resigning, he told a group of broadcasters that he 
  had thought of making the remarks Saturday night as he felt it was an important 
  issue that needed discussing. It is bad enough that he said what he said. But 
  to then follow up first with the notion that the hubbub proves him correct and 
  then state it was not a slip of the tongue but something that needed saying 
  and he prepared the remarks in his mind the night before, shows how far off 
  the mark the leading voice on radio for George W. Bush is, and why he was so 
  rapidly dispatched (he claims it was voluntary but most of us know that can’t 
  be the case with a guy who has coveted this job for years; he promised one thing 
  and delivered another. He may control the Kingdom of his radio show, but the 
  world outside that controlled universe works differently). </p>
<p> I’m a Minnesota Viking fan and I still hope I will be proven wrong in my book, 
  “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” Chapter 15, that a miracle will happen 
  to overturn the plans of our local puppet masters to kick the Vikings out of 
  town. I thought of this because here I was seeing the national puppet masters 
  working with impunity on national TV: putting down Black players and Black Coaches 
  for being Black without one response from the Blacks in the studio on the show 
  when the remarks were made. I’m also a great fan of Viking quarterback Daunte 
  Culpepper. On his radio show this week he responded to a question about the 
  Limbaugh statement, being justifiably offended, as anyone would be who was told 
  they got ahead unfairly or got ahead despite not being very good because they 
  were Black. Remember, Donovan McNabb led the Philadelphia Eagles to a win. But 
  he started poorly. And Limbaugh couldn’t wait. Like Dr. Strangelove in the film 
  of that name (played by the great comic Peter Sellers), Rush’s inner racist 
  raised its hand in salute, saying, as the USA Today article called them, “unscripted 
  remarks”: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry to say this, I don’t think he’s (McNabb) been that good from the get-go. 
    I think what we’ve had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media 
    has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well, black coaches and 
    black quarterbacks doing well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb, 
    and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn’t 
    deserve. The defense carried this team. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice he mentioned the Black leaders, coaches and quarterbacks. That was his 
  first shoe. Had he remained on the air, who knows what the second shoe for him 
  to drop would have been over the next several weeks. But if you are a Black 
  leader in the NFL, it is ominous. The NFL (for player/coach relations) and the 
  White House (for votes in 2004) will now have to choose how closely they want 
  to be associated with Rush. Don&#8217;t think we won&#8217;t be watching. </p>
<p> Rush Limbaugh sucker punched Sunday Morning Football Fans and the brass at 
  ESPN: he offended Black players and Black Coaches in general, and then he offended 
  McNabb’s White Coach and owner, and he offended ALL White fans to boot, as well 
  as the hand that feeds, the NFL itself. He exposed himself as a sniveling coward 
  (which I’ll explain in my next Blog), rude to his fellow commentators who are 
  Black, and as an unbelievably ignorant, if not stupid, analyst. Everyone knows 
  that it is McNabb that has carried this team on his back and on his two strong 
  legs. So what Limbaugh is talking is NOT football. It is just pure, unadulterated, 
  right wing racism served up purposefully (which I’ll explain in my next blog). 
  It’s bad enough that he is racist (which we already knew). But it is truly unforgivable 
  to be that unknowledgeable about football and the great players of the game. 
  As a compassionate human being, I am ashamed of him. As a Black American man, 
  I am offended, mightily. And as an ardent football fan who played football in 
  high school, I am offended that on a program about the game with the greatest 
  athletes in the world playing the greatest sport in the world requiring the 
  greatest physical efforts in the world, we are subjected to someone whose ignorance 
  of race and resentment of the achievement of players of color, and his appalling 
  lack of knowledge of the game itself, is allowed to make commentaries. Had he 
  not resigned my dial would no longer have been tuned to ESPN for this show.

<p><strong>Blog #165. October 2, 2003: The NAACP: Gallmon’s departure continues 
  the NAACP trend of placing its light under a bushel rather than making it a 
  beacon on the hill.</strong></p>
<p>Rev. Albert Gallmon has just resigned as President of our local NAACP. He said 
  he resigned (10-10-03 Star Tribune) because he failed to unify the branch and, 
  in particular, bring in middle and upper middle class members. He said that &#8220;This branch has so much potential of doing good not only for blacks, but for 
  all people of color.” He is also quoted as saying the branch “has a chance to 
  become a beacon of hope.&#8221; Yet he puts us down today as well as our history and 
  mimics the Whites when he dismisses the poor and powerless the NAACP was formed 
  to help, as his goal was to bring in “ more middle-and upper-middle-class blacks 
  into the branch” because &#8220;They have the contacts, they have the resources. They 
  know people within the community to help achieve the goals,&#8221; and then put down 
  all we know about the great leaders and leadership itself when he says &#8220;Without 
  them, the branch will continue to struggle over the mission and the leadership. 
  If the middle class is not going to engage, the branch will always struggle.&#8221; 
  That flies in the face of the history of the NAACP. This is not leadership. 
  It is elitism. It is segregation. It is exclusion. Worse, it is denying the 
  value and worth of the inner city Blacks the NAACP claims to serve. We need 
  leadership that brings us together, both poor and not poor, both Blacks and 
  Whites. That is the light of reconciliation that the NAACP keeps hidden under 
  a bushel.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #164. October 2, 2003: Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s 
  “Ubuntu Theology of Reconciliation.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 2 of 3</strong></p>
<p> Part 1 is #163. Some ask why I keep mentioning in public the fact that the 
  Black Ministerial Alliance and Leadership Forum harangued my book for over an 
  hour a year ago demanding no one read it, no one buy it, just as they demand 
  from our young Blacks to get permission from them before they do anything (even 
  though when they were young they themselves didn’t ask permission; see the moving 
  story on this in the Spokesman-Recorder (9/18-24/03, p. 1). Our local Black 
  Ministerial Alliance and Leadership Forum are people Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
  would say are deeply in need of his “Ubuntu Theology of Reconciliation.” Too 
  often, like the religious leaders in the story of the Good Samaritan, they have 
  passed by on the other side and not attended to the broken ones in our community, 
  preferring instead that the broken ones come to their doors first. Their record 
  is a scandal to those who follow Archbishop Tutu (which I discuss in Chapter 
  14 of my book). And in Chapter 5 of my of my book, I call for a common approach 
  to use to resolve our conflicts and solve our problems: apply the Golden Rule. 
  At the heart of “justice and fairness” (the title of my Chapter 5) is how we 
  treat each other in order to give all “equal access and equal opportunity.” 
  The leadership of the NAACP continues to fail to apply the Golden Rule. In my 
  book, on p. 99, I raise three questions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>First: To be fair or not to be fair, especially in education, housing, and 
    economic development (including jobs, living wages, and Black entrepreneurial 
    growth)? Second: To determine what the “do” is that we want everyone to do 
    unto everyone else: What is it? Third: Are we willing to practice this individually 
    and collectively? In other words, are we willing to treat others in education, 
    housing, jobs, wages, entrepreneurial activity, the way we want to be treated? 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In terms of the first one, what I see in terms of the Black community, is 
  that we are not being fair to our kids because of how we fight each other or 
  fight Whites from the stand point of what we as adults want not from the stand 
  point of what is good for the kids. In terms of the second one, I have answered 
  “what to do” by gathering all of my solutions in my book into Chapter 17 and 
  in a new paper, my &#8220;7 Solutions&#8221; in the Solution Papers section of this web 
  site. The seven areas are education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, and ethics. In terms of the third one: our treatment of each other 
  and of those outside our community has not followed either Rev. Leon Sullivan 
  (see Chapter 14 and 17) nor Archbishop Tutu (see Chapter 17), and for this any 
  person of conscience should feel shame. We can learn from them. In a nutshell, 
  unless we start practicing the Golden Rule, let go of the past but not forget 
  it, and focus on how to bring all up to speed in terms of education, jobs, housing, 
  public safety, etc., then we are all less. However, by working together to bring 
  these opportunities to everyone, to be sure that all are invited to the table, 
  we can all be more than we are. As Tutu says in his book <i>No Future Without 
  Forgiveness</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am because we are. We belong together. Our humanity is bound up with one 
    another. We say in our languages, a person is a person through other persons. 
    A solitary being is a contradiction in terms. I learn how to become a human 
    being through association with other human beings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Archbishop Tutu chaired the South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
  The Commission was a pioneering international event. Never before had any country 
  sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities 
  committed in the past and by achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. 
  This is a model, surely, for use in Ireland and the Middle East. He emphasized 
  restorative justice, not retributional justice. As he says, “The future cannot 
  be without forgiveness.” Thus, “To forgive is indeed the best form of self-interest, 
  since anger, resentment, and revenge are corrosive of that <i>summum bonum,</i> 
  the greatest good.” This is why, in Chapter 5 of my book, I demonstrate why 
  the best response to each other is the Golden Rule. The more we can do that 
  the more we can respond with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s non-violent responses, 
  so we can stop the deferment of our dream, and hasten the day when we attain 
  the prize on which we all must keep our eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #163. October 1, 2003: Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s 
  “Ubunto Theology of Reconciliation” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1 of 3</strong></p>
<p>In Chapter 14 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” I touch 
  briefly on the experience Nellie Stone Johnson and I had with Archbishop Desmond 
  Tutu of South Africa, back in the 80s. The title of Archbishop Tutu’s book, 
  No Future Without Forgiveness as well as his work on South Africa’s Truth and 
  Reconciliation Commission have many good things to say to us that relate directly 
  to the current firestorms in Minneapolis, and, in particular the one regarding 
  the firestorm over the appointment of Superintendent of the Minneapolis Public 
  Schools. Once again, we have been diverted by old hatreds of yesterday that 
  prevent us from doing good today so that we can’t create the future we want. 
  Our topic should be how poorly Minneapolis (and every other city in this country) 
  educates inner city Black kids. That the NAACP has backed the appointment is 
  really not the issue (it has long stood for the status quo and going along with 
  the Masters in their big house as it stays away as much as possible from the 
  fields). The issue is the fact that the NAACP hasn’t stood up to the district 
  as a whole over its poor perfomance with Black kids, especially during the tenures 
  of Black superintendents. The man the board wants once opposed making Martin 
  Luther King’s birthday as a national holiday (but so did President Jimmy Carter, 
  and thus it was that it was Ronald Reagan who signed it into law). He was also 
  opposed to divestiture as the way to fight apartheid in South Africa (which 
  was also the position of the University of Minnesota and many in the DFL, so 
  he again was in a large company). I am nervous when we hold specific views of 
  the past against people selectively, as some are held up and others are given 
  a pass.</p>
<p>This needs to stop. Why? Because our kids are the ones who pay for the hatreds 
  of their parents. And don’t forget that even though the Repubicans get the blame 
  for the flag of the Confederacy flying over the Capitol of South Carolina, it 
  was a Democratic Governor, Fritz Holllings, who put it up there (incidentally, 
  I like Hollings current web site slogan: “Performance is better than promise” 
  and recommend we apply it to the MPS). And I don’t hear any in the Black community 
  taking Senator Robert Byrd to task for his past membership in the Ku Klux Klan 
  nor for his recent use of the “N” word.</p>
<p>Earlier I talked about the need to use specific tools of conflict resolution, 
  of which a list is on my web site in the paper on “Conflict Resolutions Models” 
  posted in June 2003. We have just added two more, including the model used by 
  Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As I explain in my book (Chapter 14) Nellie Stone Johnson 
  and I had several telephone conversations with Archbishop Tutu. We were going 
  to bring him to the campus of the University of Minnesota. Tutu urged divestiture 
  (to fight apartheid by selling stocks of companies that do business in South 
  Africa). Nellie and I supported that. Others felt it would delay not hasten 
  the end of apartheid. And just as there was White fear and Black anger in South 
  Africa, we had them here too (still have them in Minneapolis). We also talked 
  with the journalist Eric Duma. Their phones were tapped. The government of South 
  Africa called the U.S. which in turn called the University of Minnesota. The 
  University Board of Governors had refused to apply sanctions. The university 
  denied our request to have Tutu speak at the University. Read about it in my 
  book: p. 222:. “Local officials, public and private, didn’t want Bishop Tutu 
  because&#8230;they didn’t want a campus movement in favor of disinvestments 
  when the University had already determined it would not divest nor favor divestment.” 
  Not the University’s finest hour&#8230;</p>
<p>In my next Blog entry, I’ll explain Archbishop Tutu’s philosophy behind his 
  theology of reconciliation for integrating South Africa after apartheid and 
  how it can be used today in Minneapolis. </p>
