<p><strong><a name="0412c0617" id="0412c0617"></a>June 17, 2004 Column #12: Why does the 
  county attorney fear change?</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> The story of the Hennepin County Attorney's May 27, 2004, letter to Police 
  Chief William McManus in the June 10 edition of the Star Tribune is self-explanatory: 
  She indicates that, in her view, there are serious flaws in the proposed changes 
  for internal investigations of incidents in which there are fatalities involving 
  the Minneapolis Police Department. </p>
<p> We are as puzzled as Chief McManus about the timing and the rationale being 
  used by the county attorney in her sudden interest about cases involving fatalities, 
  the majority of which take place in the African American communities, and her 
  desire <em>not</em> to see changes. Sure, changes are needed in the system used 
  by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office that, since the year 2000, has investigated 
  19 officer-related fatalities in which all officers were cleared. </p>
<p> Nobody is 100 percent. You can't learn from mistakes made when no mistakes 
  are admitted. Community leaders and Chief McManus are obviously not satisfied 
  with that system. As a community, we feel we are under siege and to be victims 
  of non-success because the County purposefully uses a program that delivers 
  the &quot;no mistakes&quot; results it wants. </p>
<p> As a community, we have a right to periodically ask for both a review and, 
  when needed, changes when a system clearly doesn't work. Four years. Nineteen 
  incidents. No comment from the county attorney. A new police chief comes. Change 
  is called for. <em>Now</em> we hear from the county attorney: Keep the status 
  quo; changing the process isn't the proper way to go.</p>
<p> Why? Chief McManus, over the past 29 years of his experience in Dayton, Ohio, 
  and Washington, D.C., has seen the changes he seeks work. We think change is 
  an excellent idea. We have long believed the County did not want anyone to look 
  at or change the way it reviews misconduct, particularly when there are fatalities. 
</p>
<p> Just under the story of the county attorney is the story of the death of an 
  African American in St. Paul, James Cobb, who died after a struggle with police 
  early Wednesday, June 9. What is this rash of fatalities in the Twin Cities 
  involving African Americans and the police when there are attempts made at &quot;restraint?&quot; 
</p>
<p> The county attorney needs to know that we in the African American community, 
  whether in St. Paul or Minneapolis or anywhere else in the state of Minnesota, 
  reserve the right to seek change in a system that fails us. If you were a racecar 
  driver, you would say that too often the big automobile of justice in cases 
  like this doesn't operate on justice cylinders. <br>
  After reviewing things, including consulting with the communities of color, 
  Chief McManus recommends needed change. What is the county attorney afraid of? 
</p>
<p> We also wonder why there are those in the Minneapolis City Council trying 
  to stir things up by saying that the office of Chief McManus and the mayor's 
  office are not maintaining lines of communication. We know that is not true. 
  We suspect that what is at play tonight in our city is that William McManus 
  is maintaining &quot;too much&quot; contact with the communities of color. Apparently, 
  this is not the preferred style of Minnesota nice.</p>
<p> <strong>Too much color at KTSP?</strong> </p>
<p> That is the rumor at TV station KSTP, Channel 5: too much Harris, Angela and 
  Reggie, the three prime Blacks on air on that channel. Although on her beat, 
  CJ hasn't written about it at the Star Tribune. We understand. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, reliable sources indicate to us that the leadership in the news 
  operations at KSTP Channel 5 told the above-mentioned &quot;big three&quot; 
  that the reason KSTP's ratings are down is because there are too many &quot;dark 
  spots&quot; on the screen. <br>
  The Timberwolves have far more than three dark spots and yet get top ratings. 
  So we suspect the Black talent is being scapegoated for management's poor decisions. 
  So we want to know, KSTP, why do you think it's color? Say it ain't so, baby. 
  Say we haven't slipped that far, especially after bringing Ed Asner back in 
  to rejuvenate the old image. Or is the rejuvenation just to disguise a return 
  to the old business as usual&#8212;no Blacks on the screen? </p>
<p> We believe KSTP is looking in the wrong place. Instead of the screen, it should 
  be looking in the mirror. Come on, KSTP, stop using the color of those on the 
  screen to explain why you can't get your ratings up. Maybe you need to get some 
  Viagra. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0411c0603" id="0411c0603"></a>June 3, 2004 Column #11: Loss of Moss 
  bodes ill for advocacy City Inc. needs to reverse this decision</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> May 20, 2004<br>
  We were dismayed to learn that Harry &quot;Spike&quot; Moss is being terminated 
  from his position at City Inc., effective July 8, 2004. This action is being 
  taken by the administration of City Inc. because, they say, there is no longer 
  any funding for Moss's position. Say what?</p>
<p> This is troubling, to say the least. A man who has worked so diligently and 
  tirelessly on behalf of this community for better than 40 years should have 
  been given&#8212;<strong>must</strong> be given&#8212;the greater consideration and 
  respect he has earned in this community, not unemployment and economic hardship. 
</p>
<p> Although we have no way of knowing for sure, we do know that there are those 
  who say this is a calculated decision to silence the voice of Spike Moss. We 
  hope that this is not true, and we look to hear from City Inc. to tell us it 
  isn't so. <br>
  But this does make us pause to think how this can happen to a person who has 
  already been spoken of so highly by the newly arrived chief of police for the 
  City of Minneapolis, William McManus. Chief McManus has spoken on various news 
  channels of the respect and appreciation he has for Moss. This speaks volumes 
  to the effectiveness of Moss and calls into question the actions of City Inc. 
</p>
<p> Over the decades, Moss has gained the support and the respect of some of the 
  most influential philanthropic giants in the history of this state, and the 
  undying gratitude of the people served by City Inc. How is it that there are 
  no funds for Harry &quot;Spike&quot; Moss? How is it that there was no intention 
  to request such funds on behalf of this community advocate? <br>
  The announced departure of Moss from the institution that he helped to craft 
  and develop needs to be reversed. What City Inc. has done raises a serious question 
  about the future of advocacy on behalf of the African American community in 
  Minnesota. Our community advocates are special. They must be judged and evaluated 
  on their positive effectiveness, their commitment, and on their compassion and 
  caring for the people of the community. </p>
<p> Based on that standard, Moss has more than met the test, and must be retained 
  by City Inc. to continue in the role he has played so well for them for over 
  30 years.</p>
<p> <strong>Another terror alert</strong></p>
<p> A little less than a week ago, the Bush administration, through Attorney General 
  John Ashcroft, issued a nationwide alert that they are certain that Al Queda 
  will strike the U.S. in the summer of 1994. </p>
<p> Ashcroft said this was based on intelligence received and on an Al Queda statement 
  after their Madrid bombing that they were 90 percent ready to strike the United 
  States this summer. In making the announcement, Ashcroft released the pictures 
  of seven anticipated terrorists who are their targets of interest. </p>
<p> What is troubling is Ashcroft's statement that such an attack could create 
  the same results in our election year as happened in Spain. Why would he speak 
  with such certainty? Some have wondered if he isn't saying that our being attacked 
  will create a state of emergency that will require his canceling our 2004 elections.</p>
<p> Say it isn't so, John. We know constitutionally the elections are never to 
  be cancelled. What or who does this administration really fear? Does the Patriot 
  Act give them this authority? We need to know. </p>
<p> As citizens, especially those who are the least, we need to know they won't 
  do again what was done to Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor, when Japanese 
  living in the West Coast states were sent inland, many to detention camps. We 
  need to know that our voting franchise will not be taken away, and that our 
  constitutional protections will still be in place. <br>
  Think about it. Tell us which it is, John.</p>
<p> <strong>Sports update</strong></p>
<p> By the time this column appears, we assume the Minnesota Timberwolves will 
  be down three games to two. But then, we're not sure. The series may be over, 
  and the Lakers may be waiting for the winner of the Eastern Conference. <br>
  These are two great teams. It is so difficult to defeat the powerful quartet 
  of future hall-of-famers of the L.A. Lakers. But the Timberwolves may surprise 
  us, and maybe there will be a seventh and deciding game back here in Minneapolis. 
  <br>
  Regardless, congratulations to the Timberwolves. and specifically to league 
  MVP Kevin Garnett. Either way, it will be a Minnesota team that wins.</p>
<p> <strong>The future of gasoline</strong> </p>
<p> Wow! Gasoline averaging $2.17 over the last 10 days makes us kind of wonder 
  what the future holds. Looks like we may be speaking sooner rather than later 
  of new types of cars, some that will run on water (engines that extract the 
  hydrogen) or sunlight (solar powered batteries).</p>
<p> This administration doesn't seem to have any more clue about how to protect 
  the American consumer in terms of energy than have previous administrations. 
  Is OPEC trying to influence our elections? We'd like to know. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0410c0520" id="0410c0520"></a>May 20, 2004 Column #10: &#8220;Cry, 
  the Beloved Country&#8221;: Still crying here in Minneapolis, 50 years later</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> In the last three months, the battle for the soul of the city and the future 
  of our race has been raging. The names of Barry, Paterson, Little and Fraser 
  are now part of the honor roll of African Americans who have lost their lives 
  on the streets of this city as an outgrowth of this battle. </p>
<p> Many seek answers, but few will commit to talking to our youths to convey 
  to them our sense of their importance to the future of our city. In the 1948 
  novel <em>Cry, the Beloved Country</em>, in the days just before South Africa's 
  apartheid became official, Alan Paton wrote of Blacks and Whites seeking justice 
  and kind racial relations together, as their shared future as a people and the 
  Black African's quest for freedom and emancipation from fear were on the line. 
</p>
<p> That is our situation in Minneapolis today, over 50 years later. We work for 
  social justice to unite our city, so as not to be a city of conflicting groups. 
  To hold dignity separately, we must first hold dignity together, many united 
  as one; that is the soul of Minneapolis that is ours to win or lose.</p>
<p> We saw this battle for the soul of Minneapolis at a funeral two Saturdays 
  ago in which over 800 people paid their respects to Christopher Little, a young 
  man clearly respected and loved by his peers. Ninety-five percent of those who 
  gathered were young people. Their average age was probably 17. There were far 
  too few adults. </p>
<p> The heartache and sorrow that we saw at the funeral, and later at the cemetery, 
  moved us deeply. As a citizen, as a journalist, and as an activist, we ask, 
  &quot;Where have we gone wrong? What can we do about it?&quot; That which must 
  be conveyed to each generation, firmly and without equivocation, is that our 
  young people are as important to us as anything that God has created. </p>
<p> Too many of our young people feel abandoned, labeled as bad seeds. They feel 
  there is no hope. They feel no one has a vision of a tomorrow for them. We know 
  that is not true, but they think it is.</p>
<p> These are our children. What will we give them for their future? Will we continue 
  to turn toward the wall of silence, as some did in &quot;Cry the Beloved Country,&quot; 
  as the local NAACP has done? If we don't express our concern and demonstrate 
  our caring, this generation and, thus, our race will be lost.</p>
<p> We are not talking about a race as color, although that comes into play. We 
  are talking about those who identify themselves as the sons and daughters of 
  the African. Those names that we identified earlier are part of a small army 
  of those who have fallen. Our young people cry out for help. Instead of turning 
  to the wall of silence, I invite you to demonstrate high hopes and expectations 
  for our youths.</p>
<p>  Whether it is a 53-year-old African American caught in the middle of a crossfire 
  on a street in North Minneapolis or a 16-year-old child gunned down on those 
  same streets, we must <strong>not</strong> convey the idea that we no longer 
  care to offer kindness, that we no longer love them, that we no longer have 
  high expectations for either their individual success or that of our race as 
  a whole, that we no longer are concerned that the existence of our race is in 
  jeopardy.</p>
<p> What we say here in this column is not new. It has been said since time immemorial: 
  Let us not turn our backs on our youths or our race. Let us end our silence. 
  (See my paper on <a href="../../solutionpapers/19higherhopes.htm">Higher 
  Hopes for Youths</a>.)</p>
<p> <strong>Attempt to intimidate fails</strong></p>
<p> We applaud this newspaper once again for its steadfastness and its commitment 
  to honest journalism. We were amused, but not surprised, to learn that some 
  Minneapolis officials attempted to intimidate this newspaper as they requested 
  censorship of this columnist and others.<br>
  It is always refreshing to seethose with whom you work closely stand by you 
  and support you. The officials who showed up at this newspaper making up stories 
  and spewing lies and innuendo must be placed on notice, and so I now make that 
  the order of the day. </p>
<p>  And so to you, the City's Empowerment Zone director, and to you, the City's 
  director of communications, as you advance your threats and statements of intimidation, 
  you become an open book. We accept the challenge. Let the battle begin. And 
  may the better soul of our city and community win.</p>
<p><strong>Historical appointments</strong></p>
<p>  Congratulations to Wurster, Arnson, Bahman and Edwards (no relation) and their 
  appointments by Chief Robert McManus last week as heads of the 2nd, 4th and 
  5th precincts, and the Internal Affairs Unit. In appointing two Black men, a 
  Black woman, and a White woman, this chief is showing he can walk the talk of 
  truth. We invite the City's Empowerment Zone director and the City's director 
  of communications to do the same. </p>

<p><strong><strong><a name="0409c0505" id="0409c0505"></a>May 5, </strong>2004 Column #9: 
  Dark tunnel of deceit and deception </strong> <strong>The story behind the story of the 
  Mpls Branch NAACP's collapse</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p> Last week in the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, award winning journalist 
  Isaac Peterson wrote about the NAACP and the April 17, 2004, letter sent by 
  Carl L. Breeding to Brent Buckner, Minneapolis NAACP Branch president. Breeding 
  is the nationally appointed administrator of the Minneapolis Branch. 
<p> <font color="#000000"><i>The Spokesman-Recorder </i>has been under attack 
  from those in the community who want the truth suppressed. The story behind 
  the story exposes both the cover-up of Buckner and others and their attempt 
  to tarnish Breeding by falsely claiming he was off base and overstepping his 
  bounds by being arbitrary, capricious, mean-spirited, and acting against the 
  branch's best interest. And even though the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> 
  knows of this as well, we are not surprised that they continue to suppress the 
  branch's misdeeds while this newspaper continues to speak to the truth. </font> 
<p> Buckner and the current NAACP leaders continue their predecessors' habit of 
  covering up the truth. Despite Breeding writing Buckner on January 30, 2004, 
  directing him to discharge six employees who had been hired illegally and in 
  direct violation of the constitution and by-laws of the NAACP and its personnel 
  policies, Buckner wrote questioners implying that he had the authority and, 
  in some cases, the concurrence of the national administrator to take the action 
  when clearly he did not. 
<p> Despite the branch leadership having been informed by October 20, 2003, that 
  it was placed in receivership and that a special administrator, Level 2, was 
  being appointed to take control and custody of the branch, they still went ahead 
  and spent over $119,800 without authorization and approval, as Breeding reminds 
  them in his letter of April 17, 2004. 
<p> A communiqué of March 2, 2004, discusses the cover-up of the branch account 
  balances that were lied about to members at meetings in January, February and 
  March 2004. That communique addresses accounts that need to be reviewed: Wells 
  Fargo Merchant Account, $27,056.73; U.S. Bancorp money market account, $16,520.04; 
  U.S. Bank Business Checking Account, $8,756.59. These accounts total $52,333.36. 
  In the course of communiques between principals of the NAACP and Breeding, a 
  request to transfer $14,690.94 was authorized. (Some of this has been discussed 
  in previous editions of this column.) 
<p> It is the U.S. Bank amount that has really caused concerns, frustration and 
  outrage at the misinformation provided the membership as recently as the branch's 
  April meeting. No one realized that $86,000 in investment monies had, in fact, 
  been cashed in without authorization or concurrence of the general membership, 
  despite NAACP branch officials insisting that the $86,000 was in place. 
<p> Copies of communiqués between NAACP officials explain. For example, Andy Martin's 
  communique of March 2, 2004, at 11:17 am, speaks in terms of how information 
  should be made or not made to the membership. Many are outraged. At least two 
  of the former employees ordered dismissed on January 30, 2004, have filed a 
  lawsuit in Hennepin County District Court against the NAACP branch. 
<p> This is so tragic, my friends, for this city and our people need what was 
  once a great organization to be in the forefront of those issues that continue 
  to confront our community: the lack of economic achievement, the continued discrimination 
  in education and housing, the ineptness of our community to be front and center 
  in the selection of new police chiefs and heads of the Civil Rights Department. 
<p> The local branch has lost its credibility as a civil rights organization that 
  protects and buffers its people because its leadership and their supporters 
  have slid down the dark tunnel of deceit and treachery, as was pointed out by 
  Breeding in his landmark letter of April 17. How sad it is. Roy Wilkins and 
  others who worked so hard to create this organization and give it the credibility 
  of purpose must tonight be crying from the heavens above as they watch the decline 
  of a once-proud organization. 
<p> For now, the music of deception of this branch has been stopped. The game 
  of musical bank accounts is, for now, over. But the current leadership merely 
  continued an old melody. Those who came before, including those at national, 
  got to sit down before the music stopped. As in all games of this kind of musical 
  chairs, the current leadership is left standing holding the bag. When will the 
  past leadership and national be held to account for their role in this sad, 
  long chapter of NAACP history? And will future leaders start the tune again, 
  or put it away forever? 
<p><strong> Civil Rights Department musical chairs </strong> 
<p> Mayor R.T. Rybak has nominated an executive director of the Civil Rights Department 
  of Minneapolis without having the four finalists meet with the community and 
  talk about their credentials. Is it any wonder that Natalie Johnson Lee, Green 
  Party, 5th Ward, chairperson of the Health and Human Services Committee, does 
  not want to dance to the mayor's tune? Council Member Johnson Lee has said that 
  we first need to have the community involved in the examination of the credentials 
  of the nominee. Good for you Natalie. 
<p><strong>WEBMASTER'S NOTE: </strong> The letter referenced above of Carl Breeding to local 
  branch NAACP President, Bret Buckner, is printed below in its entirety. It also 
  appeare as printed in the 4/28/2004 edition of the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, 
  as part of the article entitled: <strong>"Buckner ordered to 'cease and desist,' 
  "</strong> written by award winning journalist Isaac Peterson, III. The material 
  of the Breeding letter is a true copy, with <strong>Bold</strong> emphasis added. 
<p> As noted in the Peterson article, "the branch has been the subject of a series 
  of investigative articles . dating back to the spring of 2002." These problems 
  have been covered in these columns, as noted below in this paragraph, and in 
  the chapters of my book, "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes," as noted 
  below in this paragraph Problems reported included the branch's role in a highly 
  questionable Minneapolis legislative <strong>redistricting</strong> plan [see Chapters 
  12, 13 and 14 of my book], colluding with the developer to run African Americans 
  out of the <strong>Holman project</strong> [see Chapters 8 and 14, and 2003 columns #s 
  2-12 and 2004 columns #s S ], a <strong>stolen election</strong>in November 2002, <strong>financial 
  improprieties</strong> (Chapter 14, Columns 18, and 2004/5, 6, 7, 9), and <strong>failing 
  to meet it obligation to its mission and to our community</strong> (Chapter 14, Columns 
  14, 16, 20, and 2004/3, 4, 8, 9). 
<p>Indeed, the national NAACP has known, as I outlined it for them in my letters 
  of April 5 and 7, 2002, and my Spril 9, 2002 grievance and petition. As a result, 
  both the national and local branch successfully conspired to have me expelled 
  from the NAACP for speaking the truth (see 2003 web log entries 194, 196, 221-1, 
  208, and 224). In no case have they ever proved my allegations wrong. The Breeding 
  letter vindicates my letters and grievance. Yet, as of this writing, they have 
  uttered no apology, not moved to re-instate me, nor addressed in any way the 
  problems brought to their attention other than placing the branch in <strong>receivership</strong> 
  late last year, with an administrator assigned to oversee the branch. (See MSR 
  October 23, 2003, "National NAACP to oversee local branch," and January 28, 
  2004, "Minneapolis NAACP in receivership.") 
<p> <strong>Many people have asked the local NAACP to say it ain't so. Which it did. 
  But it is so.</strong> Despite this, in developing wording with predecessor leaders, 
  Mr. Buckner sent a letter printed in the April 8, 2004 issue of the Minneapolis 
  Spokesman-Recorder ("Minneapolis NAACP sound and solvent"), repeating his assurances 
  that all was well, that the reports of receivership were incorrect, and dismissing 
  any suggestions of anything being amiss. 
<p> <strong> Sadly, let us repeat: it is so,</strong> as affirmed by the letter dated April 
  17, 2004 to Mr. Buckner from the national NAACP receivership administrator, 
  Carl Breeding, printed last week in the MSR, which exposes the truth about Buckner 
  and the local NAACP branch and repeats what they have been told before but ignored: 
  to cease and desist: 
<ul>
  <p> <strong> "Dear Mr. Buckner: </strong> 
  <p> "I have concluded that you have not been and may not be willing to be subordinate 
    to the Minneapolis Branch NAACP Administrator and your actions indicate that 
    you do not respect the duties and responsibilities which were assigned to 
    the Administrator by the National NAACP Board of Directors. 
  <p> "You have demonstrated a <strong>blatant disregard for the directions and 
    instructions given</strong> to you as a result of the Branch being placed 
    under an Administrator. In my opinion, the words to describe your conduct 
    and behavior are: <strong>beguilement, deception, defiance, divisiveness, 
    insubordination and prevarication. </strong> 
  <p> "In a letter from Paula Brown Edme to the Minneapolis Branch NAACP, dated 
    10 November 03, The Executive Committee was <strong>told to cease and desist 
    all financial expenditures with the exception of rent, monthly utilities and 
    payroll. </strong> 
  <p> <strong>Not only did you sign checks to expend funds without the approval 
    of the Branch and the Administrator, an amount of $119,522.85 was expended 
    during the period</strong> between 10 Nov 03 and 31 Dec 03, without any approval. 
    ($45,925.88 was for professional fees) 
  <p> "The Executive Committee voted to contract with the 4 consultants, with 
    National and Treasurer's approval, for a period ending December 31, 2003. 
    I discovered that <strong>the Branch Membership never did discussed or approved 
    contracts for consultants and that you, alone, did the unauthorized hiring. 
    </strong> Neither the National NAACP, the Administrator nor the General Membership 
    have received and/or approved any employment request. 
  <p> <strong> "Money that was paid to an events coordinator, after the November 
    10, 2003 letter was done so without any approval. </strong> 
  <p> <strong> "During December, $47,175.72 was expended without approval of the 
    Membership/Administrator. Brett, you continue to incur indebtedness and obligations</strong> 
    in the name of the Minneapolis Branch NAACP in violation of Article XVII, 
    Sections 1 & 2 of the Constitution and By-Laws for Branches of the NAACP and 
    you are to cease and desist. 
  <p> <strong> "The Ron Edwards article was discussed with you, Claudie Washington 
    and several members of the Area Conference in St. Louis</strong> during the 
    Region IV Civil Rights Institute. http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=42474&sID=4from 
    you but <strong>you have not given me a copy</strong> of the article. I told 
    you that we should discuss the article during the March Executive Committee 
    meeting. <strong>When it was brought up, you stated that you, Rev. Ford and 
    Paula Brown Edme had drafted a letter to the Spokesman [Editor's note: the 
    above cited April 8 commentary] and that it was in the mail. </strong> 
  <p> "Also, President Buckner you drafted a letter, over your Branch title, to 
    Governor Pawlenty requesting his leadership to end the stalemate between the 
    Met Council and the ATU Local 1005. 
  <p> <strong> "You are to cease and desist writing letters in any form and/or 
    communicating on behalf of the NAACP and/or any other officer and/or any member 
    and/or as a representative of the Branch without the prior written Administrator's 
    approval. </strong> 
  <p> <strong> "On January 30, 2004, I directed you, Brett Buckner, to terminate</strong> 
    the unauthorized employment of Kerri Allen, Martha Arradondo, Michelle Humphrey, 
    T. Nicole James and Trayshana Thomas effective January 31, 2004. <strong>You 
    had not been authorized as President to hire anyone and the Branch had not 
    adopted an annual budget. </strong> 
  <p> "Brett, I requested copies of the contracts from you more than several times 
    but you never provided them and during the March 26, Executive Committee meeting, 
    when asked by several members, you stated that the contracts were in the NAACP 
    office. After the meeting had adjourned and in our private conversation, <strong>you, 
    President Buckner, told me that the contracts were never executed and did 
    not exist. Prevarication will no longer be tolerated. </strong> 
  <p> "On April 14, 2004 I faxed you the following statement from a Shalanda D. 
    Ballard letter that you had faxed to me: 
  <p> "'By Letter dated January 30, 2004, Mr. Breeding instructed Mr. Buckner 
    to terminate Ms. Humphrey's and Ms. Thomas's employment. Mr. Buckner, however, 
    waited until February 2, 2004 to inform Ms. Humphrey and Ms. Thomas that their 
    employment had been terminated and their last day of work at NAACP would be 
    February 3, 2004. As such, Ms. Humphrey and Ms. Thomas continued to render 
    Service until February 3, 2004.' 
  <p> "Brett, I asked you to verify in writing whether or not the statement is 
    true and/or accurate. You left me the following message on April 14, 2004: 
  <p> "'I will respond&#8230;As soon as it is humanly possible' 
  <p> <strong> "Since a 'yes' or 'no' would have sufficed, your response and behavior 
    are unacceptable and your insubordination and deception in any form and manner 
    will no longer be tolerated. </strong> 
  <p> "In summary, Mr. Buckner, you are to <strong>cease and desist performing 
    the duties of the President of the Minneapolis Branch NAACP unless you have 
    prior written approval from the Branch Administrator, Carl L. Breeding. </strong> 
  <p> "Defiance of authority and the incurring of indebtedness by any member without 
    the approval of the Branch and the Level II Administrator will be reported 
    to the NAACP Committee on Branches as conduct inimical to the best interest 
    of the Branch and the Association. 
  <p> Sincerely, 
  <p> [Signed] Carl L. Breeding 
</ul>
<p> Please note what is missing in this letter: the fact that all of this did 
  not happen just on Brett Buckner's watch. It has been building for years, and 
  has done so with the knowledge and participation of the regional and national 
  NAACP as well. Yes, Mr. Buckner has done all the wrong things Carl Breeding 
  lists. But so too did his predecessors. If Mr. Buckner is made the lone scapegoat, 
  then, when the NAACP opens up again on its own, it will be the same 'ol same 
  'ol. Minneapolis must bring to account all who led the NAACP to this pass, both 
  national and local, both now in the first decade of the 21st century as well 
  as during the last decade of the 20th century. When the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder 
  quoted one of Buckner's predecessors from last year, Rev. Al Gallmon saying 
  about this, "I'm saddened to hear about it, if it's true," it shows how much 
  people are still hoping this "goes away" (Gallmon helped Buckner write his denial 
  letter). With the national setting up Mr. Buckner as the scapegoat they ensure 
  no real changes can or will take place. We all join with the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder 
  in pledging to work cooperatively with whatever new leadership is elected, but 
  will continue to watch carefully and report back whether they are serving the 
  community or whether they have started up the music of serving just themselves. 
  All of us must insist on a full accounting of the past 15 years in order to 
  be able to have a positive impact with credibility and affirmative results in 
  the future.

The Empowerment Zones: Minneapolis' version of the plantation</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>
<p>For three weeks, this newspaper has run a series reviewing the success (for 
  Whites) and failure (for people of color) of the Empowerment Zone and the millions 
  of dollars that have been awarded to the most affluent of our community. City 
  officials have again managed to use the plight of people of color to relieve 
  their plight: their need for fresh cash. 
<p>The Empowerment Zone is one of the great disasters of economic opportunity 
  for the African American. Columnists Hodges and Thomas in this paper have reflected 
  upon the signal that has gone out, the red flag that has been raised that tells 
  the African American community, clearly, distinctly, and without equivocation, 
  that it is not on the money-spending radar of the City of Minneapolis. 
<p>Kim Havey has served as Overseer for the distribution of millions of dollars 
  that have been applied directly against the interests of the African American 
  community. And the ***Minneapolis Star Tribune*** reflects its ongoing lack 
  of commitment to communities of color by having made the political and journalistic 
  decision to suppress any comments or review of the Empowerment Zone. 
<p>As was reported in this newspaper a week ago, we were present on the occasion 
  of the Ways and Means Committee meeting when, to shock and dismay, Havey reported 
  that Allina and the YWCA had been recipients of over a million dollars without 
  any RFPs (Requests For Proposals). The person who questioned Council Member 
  Don Samuels later that day about the violation of the Empowerment Zone Governance 
  Board's own policies and procedures said he replied that it was accepted as 
  being okay. 
<p>A million dollars to White organizations, as we know, is business as usual 
  in the continued economic rape of the African American community in Minneapolis 
  under any number of administrations. Now it is the Rybak administration doing 
  it. Abuse, lies and deceit seem to be the order of the day for this administration. 
<p>How the African American community will ever gain a foothold in the great economic 
  battle that is going on in this city only God knows. Or, in the case of the 
  Empowerment Zone Governance Board and Mr. Havey, only Satan. 
<p>It is a sad commentary that this city is diverting from the people within the 
  geographic districts it was intended for the millions and millions of dollars 
  the federal government and U.S. Congress intended to alleviate poverty imposed 
  upon people of color in metropolitan areas. Alfred Flowers and Zack Montoya 
  have been working tirelessly to keep our community informed. We join them and 
  many others who are calling for an audit and for answers from the City of Minneapolis 
  as to why they are violating the legislative intent of congress regarding people 
  of color. 
<p>To now publicly state that 10 African American business entities will be considered 
  for immediate funding does not meet congressional intent; nor does it meet the 
  tests of moral honesty and integrity, things clearly lacking at Minneapolis 
  City Hall at this dark hour of nullification, reversal and business as usual. 
<p>When will the City lift the bell jar of capital to let African Americans in, 
  as intended by this program? 
<p><strong>Civil Rights Department search</strong> 
<p>An interesting slate of finalists for the position of director of the Minneapolis 
  Civil Rights Department is in place. We appreciate the story in this newspaper 
  on April 15 of the meeting hosted by 5th Ward Council Member Natalie Johnson 
  Lee (who also serves as chair of the Minneapolis City Council's Committee on 
  Health and Human Services, which has jurisdiction over the Civil Rights Department). 
<p>The comments contained in the MSR story are well appreciated by those of us 
  who have long labored in the civil rights vineyard. We look for an individual 
  to fill this position who is not only committed to the fight for civil rights, 
  but who is also committed to challenge, if necessary, the City that employs 
  him or her, including the council and mayor (the legislative and executive branches), 
  if the director determines that there is probable cause to believe that the 
  City has aided and abetted discrimination and racism. 
<p>This is not like a corporate job. The intent of the Civil Rights Ordinance 
  (I know, as I was there when it was written) is for the civil rights director 
  to have the latitude to initiate such action against the city. 
<p>A good example would be a civil rights director who was prepared to file formal 
  charges against Kim Havey and the Empowerment Zone Governance Board for malfeasance 
  in office. We suggest this would be an excellent question to pose to the candidates. 
  And hopefully, there will be a public hearing when a final nominee is selected. 
  We look forward to the challenge that must be posed. 
<p><strong>Duy Ngo We are puzzled by the decision of the City of Minneapolis to ask 
  the St. Paul Police Department to excuse themselves from the internal investigation 
  that many of us thought was going to take place. What is really at play here, 
  an attempt to cover up some previous political commitments made by the current 
  administration? My God, we hope not.</strong>

<p><strong><a name="0407c0407" id="0407c0407"></a>April 7, 2004 Column #7: No compassion 
  at city hall </strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>A double scoop in the matters of Duy Ngo and Rocco Forte 
<p>On Duy Ngo 
<p>On March 1, 2004, a Strib front-page story above the fold, headlined "Police 
  Probes Faults Cited," appeared on the surface to be great research and credibility 
  with respect to a report done by the BCA (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension), 
  requested by new Chief William McManus. 
<p>As we have watched quietly over the past month, we are still puzzled as to 
  why the Strib continues its selective reporting as it did on that BCA report, 
  particularly on why there never was a serious investigation into who shot Officer 
  Duy Ngo (shot the first time by unknown assailant[s] and the second by fellow 
  officers Storlie and Conway). 
<p>That incident of February 25, 2003, understandably tore the department apart 
  and caused serious concern in the minds of officers of color. It is disturbing 
  that the Strib did not report Mike Martin's comment, on page 17 of the BCA report, 
  that it is was Deputy Chief Lucy Gerald and Captain Stacy Altman who "perpetrated" 
  the lies about Officer Ngo shooting himself and calling him a "coward." 
<p>The Chief has promised an outside investigation. Duy Ngo has filed a civil 
  suit. Without those false rumors, we would not be in this mess. Why does the 
  Strib insist on printing rumors as if they were facts? Why does the Strib participate 
  in a significant cover-up of that shooting by leaving out such probative information? 
<p>We hope that compassion finds its way into the offices of City Hall and that 
  justice will be served. 
<p>On Rocco Forte 
<p>Fellow columnist Booker T. Hodges received three emails from the mayor: one 
  chastising him for falsely saying Fire Chief Rocco Forte was being driven from 
  office under cover of the pension issue, a second that backed off and discussed 
  "compensation," and a third that reversed itself and admitted Booker T. was 
  correct. (Booker T. also received other racist and threatening emails condemning 
  him and this newspaper.) 
<p>So city hall again demonstrated its ability to lie and its attempts to intimidate. 
  Everyone knows Rocco Forte is one of the nation's leading fire chiefs, recognized 
  for both his management skills and his ability to bring diversity to the department. 
  The mayor and his "forces," stung by their inability to make one of the police 
  GLBT persons chief of police, are determined to win on that issue by passing 
  Bonnie Bleskachek over 10 individuals who out-rank her. 
<p>Originally told he would head the Department of Regulatory Services, Forte 
  was then offered the dubious job of assistant city coordinator (dubious as there 
  is no job description for this newly found position). We are as amused as we 
  are concerned that he was pushed out so a gender/orientation plan could be implemented. 
  Amazed yet reliable sources tell us he was offered $30,000 less (since reinstated). 
  This is a terrible way to treat one of the city's top managers. It makes us 
  wonder how long he'll stay around. Tell us it isn't true, city hall. 
<p>As we submit our column, the Strib is still silent on all that it knows about 
  Duy Ngo and Rocco Forte. 
<p>On the NAACP 
<p>Big meeting two weeks ago: still no audit in place. Brett Buckner's letter 
  says all is in good shape and his investments are in good shape. Can anyone 
  show documents or minutes where the membership voted to make $86,000 in investments 
  or take out loans for supermarkets, and why $615,000 is still unexplained, as 
  well as show what they spent nearly $200,000 on in the last five months? 
<p>On Strib reporting 
<p> (1) Twice in the last six months, the Strib has revealed information that 
  makes it harder for police to pursue and prosecute a case. I've registered my 
  concern with Lou Geland at the Strib. 
<p> (2) How is it the Strib can be making inquiries on February 29 about a BCA 
  report that isn't issued until March 1? 
<p> (3) How is it that when we reported arsenic at Holmann/Heritage Park, the 
  Strib ignored us, and yet when a White neighborhood, Philips, discovers arsenic 
  in a 30-block area, it made the Strib front page last week? The Strib talks 
  the walk of community reporting, but doesn't walk the talk. 
<p>On Richard Clarke 
<p>Man of truth or man of falsehood? The debate rages on. Now Condoleezza Rice 
  will talk. Although unusual, there is a precedent for her testimony&#8212;three 
  have done so, including Carter's Zbigniew Brzezinski on allegations that Carter's 
  brother Billy was unethically working for the Libyan government. 
<p>I support Clarke's urging that we declassify documents from before 9/11 and 
  even after. What better way to demonstrate democracy to Iraq? Whether you believe 
  in their method of liberating the enslaved Iraqis or not, Condi will show what 
  Black brains can do. 
<p>On brainless racism 
<p>Former Green Bay Packer (there is a hint) Paul Hornung said last week that 
  for Notre Dame to win it needs Black players, and to get them it needs to lower 
  its academic standards, just showing how brainless racism is. The NCAA says 
  Division 1-A schools' football teams are 43.8 percent Black. Notre Dame's is 
  55.2 percent Black. Could Paul get into Notre Dame today?
