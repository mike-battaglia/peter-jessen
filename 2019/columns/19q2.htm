<p><strong><a name="c1914d0627" id="c1914d0627"></a>June, 27, 2019 #14: A Paralyzed Nation Prepares for 2020.
Will Democratic Institutions Survive?</strong></p>
<p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
    <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
    <p>As we prepare for the General Election  of 2020, many theories about the future abound in the Republican and Democratic  parties, as around the world, as many aggressively discuss and debate what  future action to take. Whose dreams about the future will prevail?</p>
    <p>Under the surface of preparing and  controlling our attempts to design and make the future is a disturbing fear: what  does the future hold? How do movies influence our dreams, movie such as "1984,"  "War of the Worlds," "Back to the Future," "Planet of the Apes," "Soylent  Green," and "Mad Max?" Are these warnings or predictions? Will we think and act  wisely about our future? As Steve Jobs said in 1983, "The Future Isn't What It  Used to Be."</p>
    <p>Some of us remember the 1941 book, <em>Escape from Freedom</em>," about the fear of  freedom that causes people to seek safety in <em>authoritarians,  dictators, and various "leaders,' whether </em>liberal or conservative,<em> whether  government or non-government, whether tribal around identity or special  interests, who want to tell us peace and our safety will be ours if we just  follow them.</em><strong> </strong><br>
      <br>
      In  a recent column we noted Americans have been traditionally blessed by the  voices of great thinkers, Black and White. Such as  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK, Nelson Mandella, Mahatma Ghandi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Where  are the thinkers today? When will they step forward? Where are the voices that will help us end our paralysis? .</p>
    <p>Again I ask: what thinkers in our  institutions and in our communities, will aid us in maintaining some balance  regarding the perspectives and overviews that can help us understand the  actions to take to achieve the prize and avoid fear and paralysis? We have offered over 50 solution papers for the conversation. </p>
    <p>Who will survive the 2020 election? A  white person? An African American? A man? A woman? Regardless, any president's  policy successes are ours, just as any president's policy failures are ours as well.  As we move forward, ponder well the 2020 election and the history, promises,  and achievements of its cast of characters. Out of the group of over 20, who  will bring a vision and action to get us out of our paralysis? Will we think  for ourselves?</p>
    <p>The world's nations don't seem  comfortable offering peace. Whose foreign future vision will prevail? America's?  China's? Russia's? Iran's? Africa's? Venuezuela's?</p>
    <p>Many theories are kicked around for  how to play the peace and diplomacy game other than just hoping for the best. Many  are understandably afraid, given so much doubt and hatred based on religion and  race, and on envy and resentment. Much thus comes down to fear. The fear of  losing our way of life, the fear of losing our wealth, the fear of losing our  future, the fear of losing our communities.</p>
    <p>So, let's think of great minds around  the world that are trying to think through the fear and apprehension, through  the anger and frustration. In America, African Americans understand apprehension  and fear better than most, as they have experienced it the most, with Native  Americans understanding it even more.</p>
    <p>Should we play the game, ignore today'  fears and failures, and say we'll succeed tomorrow? Will there be a tomorrow  for a next time? Far too many people have only hope to get by toanother day. What  will be our options as we move towards the election of 2020? Only the Almighty  can answer these questions. We need to hear voices that know what they are  talking about. Absent such thinkers' voices, fear will prevail, not peace. Will  we move forward or backward?</p>

	<p><strong><a name="c1913d0620" id="c1913d0620"></a>June, 20, 2019 #13: A City Under Siege. Guns and other Violence.
Will words in reports be backed up with words put to action?
</strong></p>
<p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
    <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
    <p>Not  since Minneapolis was called "Murderopolis" have Twin City African America  communities felt agony from failed answers for dealing with violence in our  communities. During a period two weeks ago, eight African American women were  shot and wounded in five separate incidents in the Twin Cities, including women  stabbed in the middle of Hennepin Avenue.</p>
    <p>The East  Side of St. Paul has become a battle ground for gang violence, with the Rondo  Dale community especially feeling the results of renewed violence, just as in  North and South Minneapolis, as violence devastates communities.</p>
    <p>The Twin  Cities are not alone. For example, in a two-week period recently, in Chicago,  nearly 100 were shot or stabbed.</p>
    <p>There is  great concern in many quarters regarding violence. Families go to bed at night  and wake up in the morning to sounds of gunfire. Official and unofficial  meetings and conversations, continue in government and in profits and  non-profits, including churches, think tanks, universities and policy centers, not  to mention demonstrations.</p>
    <p>Across  America, will we again follow Martin Luther King's non-violence approach, and  judge others by their character and not their color or shade of color, or will  we continue with violence in response to words in reports, newspapers and oral  comments?</p>
    <p>Some say  violence in all its forms is creating a brain drain, a kind of brain flight  from the African American communities, as problem solvers in Black communities bail  out, as seen, for example, in California, Illinois, New York and Minnesota, as  they head for places like Arizona, Atlanta, Texas, Washington DC., etc. ).</p>
    <p>Do those  leaving know something the rest of us don't know or won't consider?</p>
    <p>Could it  be that when talk at meetings and printed words in plans, programs, new papers  and social media, whether official or unofficial, don't solve problems, brains  seem to move on to ply their rhetoric elsewhere? Are guns and other forms of  violence to then become the order of the day?</p>
    <p>Elected  and appointed officials are more cautious as their approaches to solving  violence fail. Will any of the $2 million of the the $20M settlement in the  case of Mohammed Noor go to fighting violence rather than to just reward the  family of the victim?</p>
    <p>The  Minneapolis Foundation, among others, claims to have solutions implementable by  the right people and organizations to solve problems. Why haven't they been  able to effectively address gun, knife, and fist violence in families, schools,  work places, neighborhoods, streets and alleys, after solution words were put  on paper?</p>
    <p>When  leaders and thinkers abandon their communities, hopelessness follows. Needed  are actions to not only provide positive visions for African American  communities, as brains flee, but to also raise up local brains that will stay.</p>
    <p>The  pattern: unkept promises to verify real project employment numbers. Could this  be another reason for both continued violence, whether by guns, knives, or fists,  and the brain drain / brain flight?</p>
    <p>When  will success claims finally be authenticated for such specific projects and  their results, such as the Hollman Project in the late 1990s - 2000s, or, since  then, street and rail projects, professional stadiums and ball parks, and other  private sector, government and education building projects? Or will a major  result be the on-going lowering of confidence in African American community leaders,  who too often talk the walk but do not walk their talk to reduce violence?</p>
<p>Is  leadership silent in exchange for being quiet about violence and racial  division visions that will never come, as they who developed the failed visions  wait quietly to leave town? We have strong suspicions that this is what it is.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1912d0606" id="c1912d0606"></a>June, 6, 2019 #12: Trump's real-life 'game of thrones'</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>As of the writing of this column, President Donald Trump and his advisors  are continuing to play their own "game of thrones" with countries who would do  the U.S. harm.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my July 6, 2019 column, the biggest thrones confronting the  United States and the world, include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Russia</strong>, which is also eyeing Europe and the  Middle East. </li>
  <li><strong>China</strong>, which is bragging it will be the world's  high tech leader by 2025, will command the Pacific by 2035 and will be the world's  lead power by 2049, the 100thanniversary of China's Communist  Revolution. </li>
  <li><strong>North Korea</strong>, which is backed by China and Russia. </li>
  <li><strong>Iran,</strong> which is already testing its power in the  Middle East, with an eye on the world. </li>
  <li><strong>Venezuela, </strong>which is backed by Russian, Chinese and  Cuban troops. </li>
  <li><strong>Castro's and Che's followers:</strong> bring down the USA by flooding it  with people and drugs,</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of Russia, these countries are all nations of color.</p>
<p>With Trump's direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National  Security Advisor John Bolton have become messengers of potential war and death.  How much conflict will the president stir  up, let simmer, and then stir up again?</p>
<p>The U.S. has troops stationed in nearly 150 countries, with some 800  military bases around the world, 76 in Latin America. We are still involved in  armed conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Central Africa. Now what?</p>
<p>It makes one wonder what Trump's understanding is of the various parts of  the world. Is he properly educated on the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between  North and South Korea, the Persian Gulf states, and Latin America, as he flirts  with danger?</p>
<p>Currently, 28,000 Americans are in the DMZ that separates North and South  Korea. And what about the nearly three million Arab and Persian soldiers in the  Persian Gulf, not to mention the 128,000 in the Venezuela military in a country  twice the size of Iraq?</p>
<p>Does the Trump administration understand what the casualty figures could  be, with so many troops used as chips in this game of thrones? But, the  question that must always be asked is what would be "acceptable" casualties in  any conflict? What is an acceptable casualty figure for both sides of the  current state of affairs? How are casualties seen as worth it?</p>
<p>The American public does not know how to ask those questions nor the question of what makes an American. Americans are actually more  apprehensive of war today than in the early days following Sept.  11, although some Trump supporters won't admit it.</p>
<p>What is Trump's rationale? What is his voice of logic and reason? Without a  voice of reason, the result could be great tragedy between now and the 2020  election.</p>
<p>This is not like shopping in a supermarket, starring in a hit series about  war or play-acting at an amusement park. This is serious.</p>
<p>Is Trump marching to the 1930 drums of former UK Prime Minister Neville  Chamberlain while playing the game of Munich? Do we really know? Those too young  to remember are part of the masses who do not recognize how dangerous this world  situation is.</p>
<p>Trump. Pompeo. Bolton. Are these three horsemen of the apocalypse riding  toward death and mayhem, expecting nations to follow them over the cliff &mdash; and  not ask questions?</p>
<p>We ask the president: how many lives will be lost in this continued quest  to establish this "game of thrones" legacy? God help us all, and God bless  America. </p>

What will be the casualties?
</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>As of the writing of this  column, Donald Trump and his advisors continue to play their game of thrones  with those who would do us harm. Donald Trump clearly has a list of countries  he is willing to confront.</p>
<p>The biggest thrones challenging  us are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Russia (also eying Europe and the Middle East).</li>
  <li>China (bragging they will be the world's leader  in high tech by 2025, will command the Pacific by 2035 and will be the word's  lead power by 2049, the 100th anniversary of China's Communist  Revolution).</li>
  <li>North Korea (backed by China and Russia).</li>
  <li>Iran (testing in the middle East, eyeing the  world).</li>
  <li>Venezuela (backed with Cuban, Russian and  Chinese troops in country, following Castro's and Che's strategy to flood the  United States with people and drugs.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's be mindful that with the  exception of Russia, these countries are nations of color.</p>
<p>The United States raised most  countries from the rubble of World War II (including the "axis" of Germany,  Japan, and Italy, as well as England and France). We have troops stationed in  nearly 150 countries, with some 800 military bases around the world, 76 in  Latin America. We are still involved in armed conflict  in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Central Africa. Now what?</p>
<p>How much conflict will the  President stir up, let simmer, and then stir up again? The question that must  always be asked, as I did in this column a year ago: what would be "acceptable"  casualties in any conflict? How are casualties seen as worth it?</p>
<p>Secretary of State Pompeo and  National Security advisor Bolton are messengers of potential war and death. Americans  are more apprehensive today than the early days after 9/11, although some Trump  supporters won't admit it.</p>
<p>As we said in this column  several weeks ago, this Republic has been blessed since 1776, with leaders who  were American heroes, including Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, the two  Roosevelts, and JFK. What is Trump's rationale? What is his voice of "logic"  and "reason?"</p>
<p>Without a voice of reason, the  result could be great tragedy between now and the 2020 election. One wonders  what Donald Trump's understanding is of the various parts of the world,  especially the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between North and South Korea, the  Persian Gulf states, and Latin America? Is he flirting with danger or being  realistic?</p>
<p>We ask the President: what is  an acceptable casualty figure for both sides? Currently, 28,000 Americans are  in the DMZ that separates North and South Korea. And what about the nearly 3  million Arab and Persian soldiers in the Persian Gulf, not to mention the  128,000 in the Venezuela military, in a country twice the size of Iraq?</p>

Is Donald Trump marching to the drummer whose  name was Neville Chamberlain while playing the game of Munich? Us "oldsters"  know. Those too young to remember are part of the masses who do not recognize  how dangerous this administration could be. Trump. Pompeo. Bolton.

<p><strong><a name="c1910d0516" id="c1910d0516"></a>May, 16, 2019 #10: Noor and $20 million; Noor imprisoned in Oak Park Heights </strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>The saga of Mohammed Noor has  ended. A jury of his peers found him guilty on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, of the  fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, in 2017, the first time a Minnesota police  officer has been found guilty of an on-duty murder, charging Noor with third-degree  murder and second-degree manslaughter. The jury acquitted him of the most  serious count &mdash; second-degree murder. </p>
<p>The Star  Tribune reported that Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has "defended every  prevous police shooting investigation his office has reviewed &mdash; and cleared of  criminal wrongdoing &mdash; as "superb."</p>
<p>Three days later, Fri, May 3rd, at  6 am, Mohammed Noor was taken by a rented Greyhound bus to the Minnesota  maximum security prison at Oak Parks Heights. He is to be sentenced by the  Judge on June 7th. No major newspaper, as of the writing of this  story, has reported Noor's circumstances.</p>
<p>Judges signing orders to remove  prisoners from the Hennepin County Jail to the Minnesota Super max, are not  required to provide factual information, other than to say it was for security  reasons. That is broad and vague and is fraught with additional opportunity for  cruel and unusual punishment for this man of color. The rumors are that  Mohammed Noor will not survive inside that notorious super max prison.</p>
<p>The nation is aware that the most  severe punishment, short of his death, has been imposed. The Star Tribune talks  of an appeal but it is, in our opinion, that Mohammed Noor will never survive  to know the results of his appeal. We would be remiss in this column if we did  not point out that in order to silence the Somali community, their leadership  has been told that deportation of even native born Somalis will take place if  they are publicly critical of the prosecution of the trial and of his current  imprisonment in the super max prison facility at Oak Park Heights.</p>
<p>Questions easily come to mind. Is  this is another return to a time of selective acts of slavery, when there were  no rights that a black person had, that the white justice system was just for  whites.? Is the respect here modeled after Guantanamo and the secret courts? We  were a tad surprised that Mr. Noor's attorney of record did not immediately let  the general public know the actions taken against Mr. Noor, and the dangers he  faces in regards to his life and future survival.</p>
<p>It is no accident that Mr. Noor is  being housed in close proximity to neo-Nazis and was transferred with  sympathizers that were being transferred from the Iowa prison in Ft. Madison,  Iowa.</p>
<p>Why is there such a lack of concern  for the future safety of Mohammed Noor?. All that the communities of color can  do is pray for his survival and safety. $20 million goes a long way in  determining what types of things have to happen to facilitate the ultimate  vendetta against Mohammed Noor. Contrary to what is being said, it is about  race, and it is a warning to the sons and daughters of the African regarding  what the future could hold in justice and liberty that have become fake  declarations. We are not seeing the justice of white justice on display.</p>
<p>It has not gone unnoticed that we  also saw Black justice that week, when Senior U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, intervened, after the Noor  verdict, to get the settlement talks in the Jamar Clark lawsuit resumed, that  has been shamefully delayed for over 2 years. Jamar Clark was shot dead by  police in 2015.</p>
<p>Will there be a "transformative"  amount for the Clark family as for Damon family.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1909d0502" id="c1909d0502"></a>May, 02, 2019 #09: Trump vs. the United States. President gears up for Supreme Court Battle </strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>On Monday, April 22, President  Donald Trump and the Trump organization filed suit against the U.S. House of  Representatives House Oversight Committee (chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings,  D-Maryland), suing to prevent the financial records of the Trump organizations  and family from being obtained from their accounting firm.</p>
<p>This is setting a legal  precedent of a President suing the country of which he is the President. It  will be the fact forever attached to his name, that the Donald Trump suing the  USA was also the President of the USA.</p>
<p>This will test the limits of  the Supreme Court of the United States (referred to as SCOTUS). - My analysis  is that President Trump seems to expect the 9-member Supreme Court to vote in  favor of his case when it reaches the Court, overturning the 535 members of  Congress (Senators plus Representatives). But the votes that will truly judge  this case will be the millions of voters who vote in the election of 2020.</p>
<p>We said in this column two  weeks ago that this president is going to wear down the stamina and the energy  of the SCOTUS, despite advisors convinced this is not the path to take, just as  members of Congress have determined the path of multiple investigations and,  potentially, impeachment (also against advisors). Will these paths combine to  shred the Constitution and create more division? Will the SCOTUS represent a  greater support platform for the president than the congress and the American  public? At stake is the stability of our country.</p>
<p>The president continues to say  the US economy and military are as strong as they have ever been in our  history. Will this last? Will it be temporary under Trump? Can Democrats act  such that it brings the country together to make the good news long lasting and  not temporary? Is this nation tough enough, strong enough, committed enough and  honest enough to show the courage to bring the nation back together again? Our  question is not about the prosperity bus but about who will be pushed to the  back of the prosperity bus. This is about both parties, as seen in this April  24, 2019 Star Tribune headline, about Democratic Governor Tim Walz's proposed  budget: <em>Lowest income-Minnesotans hit  hardest by Gov. Tim Walz.</em></p>
<p>Let's be candid about 2020: the  two parties have made their bets about which path to take. Yet I see no  contender in the Democratic Party nor any challenger in the Republican Party  who are prepared to provide the leadership this country so desperately needs  for results that are long term, not just short term.</p>
<p>Americans have long had the  confidence that someone who would always step up to take the challenge and be  victorious. My chilling feeling is that the messenger we await is not about to  arrive. How will "Trump vs. the United states of America" go? A frightening  question. It does not bode well for unity nor for preserving the importance and  efficacy of the nation's Constitution, especially if either party sacrifices  "We the people" for "we the party," and hold "life" and "liberty" and "the  pursuit of happiness" for one side and not for the other side?</p>
<p>This is what the 1st  amendment and USA ideas for institutions of democracy are all about. Those who  wish to tinker with what we call the United States of America must first offer  a prayer for strength and guidance for how and for which path. That is what the  court case Trump vs. the USA will be about: which path. Let us pray for  strength, vision, and the wisdom for this decision. God knows we need that. Hence  our prayers.</p>

  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>Article On  April 8 2019, Hennepin County District Judge Kathryn Quaintance gaveled  the opening of the trial of Mohammed Noor, former Minneapolis police officer,  on trial for the July 15, 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.</p>
<p>The shooting tragedy for both  sides is not denied. For some, the shooting death shall forever live in infamy.  For others, the legal process up to this point has been one of suspicion, as  seen in legal questions reported by the Star Tribune the morning of the first  day of the trial, that the presiding judge changed her mind to allow showing  video to the public, due to the intervening in this trial by both  official Minneapolis and multiple news organizations.</p>
<p>Originally charged with 3rd degree murder and  1st degree manslaughter, County Attorney Michael Freeman, a year later, in 2018, fresh from victory of  being elected for another four-year term, upgraded the charge against Mohammed  Noor to 2nd degree murder. This is the first time in the history of  Minnesota that a peace officer has been charged with both offenses.</p>
<p>In our next column, in two  weeks, we will write of the significance of the racial complexion of the jury.  There has already been controversy in regard to the number of both media and  citizens that will be allowed in one of the smallest courtrooms in the government  center. The Australian media has almost as many seats as the American media, by  order of the presiding judge.</p>
<p>According to Anglo Saxon law,  the prosecution goes first. In presenting its case against Mohammed Noor, the prosecution  may call as many as 50 witnesses who allegedly have knowledge regarding the shooting,  even though only four were in the alley. Prosecution witnesses will tell their  stories, attempting to reflect on Mohammed Noor in the most negative of ways. The  complexities are why the Judge has indicated why it is often difficult for a trial to be fair. In our March 21, 2019 column, we  acknowledged this regarding any trial pursuing justice. Justice is based on  rules. In our March 15 2018 column, we wrote that it appeared that part of the  Noor trial will be based on a mis-interpretation of the Minnesota  Constitution.</p>
<p>Among the questions we hope the  trial answers is who, other than the homicide detectives, called Justine's  fianc&eacute; in his room at his hotel in NYC (or Las Vegas; we have heard both). And  who from the Minneapolis Police Department called government 0fficials in  Australia and provided information to Australia's Prime Minister Turnbull,  alleging the violent nature and the poor training of Black officers in the  Minneapolis Police Department?</p>
<p>What calls were made on the  night of July 15 and early morning of July 16? Were these calls authorized by  the command staff in the MPD? These questions are reinforced by articles  presented in Australian papers and by other Australian media.<br>
  As of the writing of this  column, the defense was debating whether to put Mohammed Noors on the stand in  this very volatile case. Why is it only one other Somali in the 5th precinct,  who was acting as a supervisor of that night for the city, was told of the  death of Justine, and ordered to disengage and not carry out his responsibility  or supervision? That raises other questions regarding bias toward Somalis. In  the interest of unity and fairness, these and other questions should be  answered under oath. Failure to do less supports the judge's concern about a fair  trial and a true effort to reach a fair conclusion on the spectrum dealing with  levels of guilt and intent.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1907d0404" id="c1907d0404"></a>April, 04, 2019 #07: Special counsel reports "no collusion" with the Russians.</strong><strong>Attorney General to rule on whether obstruction took place</strong></p>
<p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
<em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>After a little over two years,  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has forwarded his findings to the Attorney  General of the United States (a 4-page summary is on line, as we wait for  more). The report's conclusion of "no collusion" between Trump and his campaign  with the Russians, has Democrats and mainstream journalists in a meltdown, as  the belief is how else could Trump have beaten Hillary?</p>
<p>This "no collusion conclusion"  reveals how many elected and appointed politicians, and their staffs, including  2020 candidates, and the journalists that spread their talking points, have not  only fooled us, but that they have believed only their view could prevail,  demonstrating how little they understand about the difference between their  views and the Constitution's directives that govern the process in general and  how the Congress failed to follow its own Special Counsel rules.</p>
<p>We can only conclude that Cable  TV and print media are exposed as being intellectually shallow, historically  ignorant, incompetent and lacking in knowledge and understanding of the constitution  and the USA institutions entrusted to them for safeguarding the rights of  American citizens now and into the future, including the Constitution's rules  for political engagement and all matters pertaining to the election of 2016. Legislators  and mainstream journalists should be embarrassed.</p>
<p>These legislators and  journalists, the alleged guardians of the constitution, have been behaving as  little children on a political playground, where name calling and petty actions  expose their laziness and lack of understanding of what they should have  understood about the Special Counsel's report, dragging the American public  through their bureaucratic mud.</p>
<p>House Democrats are setting  Mueller's report aside, ordering eighty-one new investigations, as both Maxine  Waters and House Judicial Committee Chairman Adler have said the Mueller report  is not the end but instead just the beginning of investigating trump.</p>
<p>One can only imagine how many  law suits from legislative committees and various public interest groups will  flow from these 81 investigations, the result of which will exhaust the Supreme  Court with endless cases of litigation.</p>
<p>News outlets (print, broadcast  and digital), including those in the Twin Cities, will also be exhausted by all  the moves and counter moves. Will it take a second civil war between the  political left and right to bring order?</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln said &quot;Truth is generally the best vindication against  slander.&quot; With all the counter "truths," which truth will prevail? What  will be the price paid by main stream media for misleading readers and viewers  for over two years with the claim that Muellers report would show that  all was "settled:" that Trump colluded with the Russians to defeat Hilary.</p>
<p>I know how difficult it will be  for some to accept my conclusion that "Vladamir Putin has won," as the campaign  dossier that started all of this was aided and abetted by Russia's meddling,  which it has done for over 30 years. Russia/Putin's success in helping to  control and interfere in the American election has gone beyond anything those  in the Kremlin could have dreamt up.</p>
<p>Many ask how this will affect  the 2020 election. Both sides say it will help their side get elected. Whichever  way it goes after the meltdown over the Mueller Report's unexpected "no  collusion" conclusion, the questions remain: will "God Bless America?" "Will  God help deliver us from mainstream journalism's ineptness, laziness, and  indifference? How long will "America the beautiful" remain America the confused  and duped? Finally, will American sons and daughters have to fall on internal  fields of battle in order to preserve this nation?</p>
<p>Offer a prayer not only for  yourself but for all of us. We will need it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
