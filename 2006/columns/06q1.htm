  #7: </strong><strong></strong><strong>Let Daunte Go In Peace! </strong><strong>The 
  Attacks on Culpepper Continue</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>At his 3-20-06 appearance before the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce, new Vikings 
  Head Coach Brad Childress squandered his <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/14146564.htm" target="_blank">public 
  debut</a> by fanning the flames of pettiness through character assassination 
  of Daunte Culpepper rather than talk of his vision for the &#8216;06 season. </p>
<p>The 3-21-06 Pi Press reported <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/football/14147157.htm" target="_blank">Childress 
  told the chamber he didn't want Daunte</a> (&#8220;Childress heard enough&#8230;to 
  know he didn&#8217;t want Daunte Culpepper on his football team&#8221;). The 
  owners gave him his wish.  So why blast Daunte?  Why wasn&#8217;t 
  Childress man enough to see Daunte face to face instead of just on the phone? 
  The new owner met Daunte face-to-face.  Why decide on <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/football/14147157.htm" target="_blank">hearsay</a> ?  What kind of coach (or any leader) makes decisions on hearsay? </p>
<p>Childress followed the Twin City script of demeaning high level Blacks when 
  they leave.  Although the new owner had stated publicly he wanted both 
  Moss and Culpepper, his staff out maneuvered him on each and he lost two of 
  the NFL&#8217;s best players.  Childress showed his audience he can crack 
  the whip.  His comments about Culpepper are like saying he, Childress, 
  is head of the Vikings plantation, and that Black players beware: the master 
  is here.  Do as I say or be gone. </p>
<p>This was not surprising to us long time observers of the Vikings sports scene. 
  It is an old Vikings script:  &#8220;Negro, mind your manners, 
  be humble, be obedient, and do a little jig for Boss.&#8221; </p>
<p>Racism blinds.  Even though Daunte Culpepper was respected on the field, 
  in the locker room, and in the community, the Massas class is so obsessed with 
  flogging their Black workers that they don&#8217;t realize that the entire plantation 
  could erupt in rebellion. </p>
<p>Brad Childress is a hearsay man who, as an assistant coach in Philadelphia, 
  made some rather unfounded observations about Daunte Culpepper&#8217;s intelligence 
  and intellect at a time when Philadelphia was making their selection decision 
  for their future quarterback.  Maybe that explains why Daunte felt it 
  was time to leave.  And it may also explain why Daunte, who thought he 
  still had good relations with the organization, was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/510/story/321494.html" target="_blank">turned 
  down when he asked for Coach Childress' playbook</a> (Strib, 3-22-06, &#8220;Childress 
  withheld playbook from Culpepper&#8221;) .  Why give one to someone you 
  plan to trade?  Maybe Coach Childress, who has never called an offensive 
  play in his professional life, felt that his offensive scheme was too complex 
  for a slow-witted Daunte Culpepper.  Although new, Coach Childress has 
  already picked up his cue:  play to the maddening crowd of local sports 
  fans and writers, invoking the race card to humiliate and degrade a young man 
  for no other reason than the color of his skin (that is The Twin Cities way). 
  Daunte, among the top 5 in the NFL, will answer on the field in Miami. </p>
<p><strong>Whose life is more important in death? </strong></p>
<p>In Doug Grow's column of Tuesday, March 21, (<em>Violence creeps into Uptown&#8212;and 
  our Consciousness</em>) he talked about the tragic death of a 25 year old White 
  West Virginia man, who was shot and killed on the previous Saturday in the Uptown 
  area of Minneapolis.  Early on in his article, Doug pointed out the following: 
  &#8220;Perverse as it was, if this crime had happened in a poor neighborhood, 
  it wouldn't have dented the consciousness of most of us. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/465/story/319757.html" target="_blank">Crimes 
  against the poor in poor neighborhoods should be taken just as seriously as 
  crimes in Uptown or downtown</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>One has to appreciate and respect Doug Grow for picking up on the undercurrent 
  of race.  Unlike when Blacks are killed, there will be hell to pay this 
  time, as it was a white man shot by a Black man.  The city assumes crime 
  is out of control, that the city was in danger, and that the safety of white 
  folks is at risk. </p>
<p>People conveniently forgot that on that same block, about five days before, 
  a young Hispanic had been gunned down and killed (with no fanfare or candlelight 
  vigil or news coveage).  It is considered murderous mayhem only when there 
  is a White death. </p>
<p>As we write this column, there have recently been 12 homicides in the City 
  of Minneapolis, 9 African Americans, 2 Hispanics, and one White.  And 
  yet it was the one White death that created a call to arms, a call for draconian 
  measures to deal with a now sense of emergency.  The calculus is simple: 
  the loss of one white life is more dear than the deaths of 11 human beings of 
  color. </p>
<p>We appreciate that a white columnist writing for a white paper had the courage 
  and conviction to expose the soiled petticoats of racism.  Poor Black 
  communities of Minneapolis understand there is no compassion or sensitivity 
  to our plight:  that the life of one white is worth more than the life 
  of 11 persons of color.  The silence from the leadership of this 
  city is deafening, as communities of color are important to them only on election 
  days.  Otherwise, by their actions, they are saying that our lives and 
  our future have no value to them, as they see us being of no consequence.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0606c0315" id="0606c0315"></a>March 15, 2006 Column #6:</strong> <strong>A 
  BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>With the departure from this life of the beloved Kirby Puckett, baseball lost 
  part of its soul, part of its tenderness of life. Kirby had an infectious smile, 
  a love of the game (two time World Series Champion, MVP, golden glove All-Star 
  Hall of Famer), a love of the fans (he sign autographs for all who waited) and 
  a love of the community (he was proud to be a Minnesotan). That was 45 year 
  old Kirby Puckett, friend and mentor to many in and outside of the game. </p>
<p>As Kirby enters that eternal Hall of Fame, we can see standing at those gates, 
  welcoming him, Satchell Page, Josh Gibson, Jackie Robinson, Oscar Charleton, 
  and the other great legends of the games. </p>
<p>If I were a newspaper editorial cartoonist, I would draw Kirby standing tall 
  next to Jackie Robinson who has his arm around Kirby&#8217;s neck while saying, 
  &#8220;Welcome big fella, we&#8217;ve been waiting a long time for you.&#8221; 
  Thus we celebrate a great man, who led a great life, part of which happened 
  to include being a great baseball player. We&#8217;ll save for another time 
  our comments on the hypocrites, white and black, who turned their backs on him, 
  who severed their relationships with him, who pretended he was not the great 
  human being that many knew him to be, who broke his heart. </p>
<p>Kirby joined the spirit of our beloved Nellie Stone Johnson in recognizing 
  the importance of education by establishing scholarships at the University of 
  Minnesota. He raised millions for the American Heart Association. Look how many 
  girls and boys, black and white, are named after Kirby. Recall the little Latin 
  American girl who only knew two words of English: Kirby Puckett, as it was Kirby 
  who chartered the plane that flew her to doctors to fix her heart, at Kirby&#8217;s 
  expense. </p>
<p>This is what makes so wonderful the tremendous outpouring of love for Kirby 
  since his passing. As a columnist, we sadly recall recall having to write about 
  how the fans of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest turned their backs on him. So 
  we are particularly moved to see them coming back with an outpouring of love 
  and sorrow for a man who left this world before his time. I just wish he could 
  have experienced the true emotions of the everyday fan. So many river folk gain 
  a tremendous sense of identity with their pro teams (Kansas City, St. Louis, 
  Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati). In the Twin Cities, many fans developed their 
  sense of identity first through Kirby Pucket, then the Twins, then the Twin 
  Cities. What greater tribute can we offer? We can just see Kirby in that heavenly 
  Hall of Fame Above, aviator&#8217;s cap on, waving one of those homer hankies 
  as he says, &#8220;I love you Minnesota fans.&#8221; Kirby was and always will 
  be the beloved Kirby Puckett. </p>
<p><strong>Daunte Culpepper: A Man on the Move </strong></p>
<p>Another great relationship has come to an end, this time between one of the 
  great quarterbacks of the game and the Minnesota Vikings organization. The mainstream 
  media have portrayed Daunte Culpepper as an African American who didn&#8217;t 
  appreciate what the Massa has done for him, and that he is not able to understand 
  his life and finances. </p>
<p>Thus, Minnesota and its mainstream media continue to poison the well with their 
  obsession with destroying successful, outstanding African American athletes 
  and coaches. Daunte Culpepper is being run out of town, and joins the exit parade 
  of Clem Haskins, Sidney Lowe, Denny Green, Randy Moss and Kirby Puckett. Is 
  Kevin Garnett next? We discussed this in our 2005 year end column, as we welcomed 
  an exception, the Star Tribune sports writer Patrick Reusse&#8217;s 12-19-05 
  column about the racism of Minnesota reflected in the way fans gave white Brad 
  Johnson a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for his errors while<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5789824.html" target="_blank"> &#8220;screaming for Daunte&#8217;s neck&#8221;</a> regarding his, which connects 
  with Pioneer Press sports columnist Tom Powers&#8217; 3-9-06 column headline: 
  the <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/columnists/tom_powers/14052077.htm" target="_blank">&#8220;Vikings 
  fumble truth in running off Culpepper.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Former Head Coach Denny Green appreciated the fact that his African American 
  players were also sensitive and, like most of us, proud young men wanting to 
  be successful and win on the field of competition, and be appreciated and respected 
  by the organization, by the media, and, most importantly, by the fans. </p>
<p>The Vikings staff held over from previous ownership (which we warned against), 
  working behind new ownership&#8217;s back, has finally gotten rid of the last 
  of Green&#8217;s great ones. It will now be &#8220;their&#8221; team. Moses&#8217; 
  declaration of &#8220;let my people go&#8221; has become the corner stone of 
  African American athletes and coaches in this state (and why many bypass the 
  UM). Minnesota will continue to enjoy its racist musical scores of nullification 
  and reversals of Black men. Regardless, Daunte will go with dignity. We will 
  continue to enjoy Daunte on TV, wherever he goes. Daunte is a young man who 
  only asks to be respected as a human being and as a man. He has earned it. As 
  in previous columns, we salute Daunte and say, &#8220;Thank you. God bless you. 
  All the best.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><a name="0605c0301" id="0605c0301"></a>March 1, 2006 Column #5: </strong><strong>What 
  a disappointment: The long awaited testimony </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>As one reads the headlines of the Thursday, 2-23-06 front pages of the Strib 
  (<a href="http://www.startribune.com/467/story/263521.html" target="_blank">Witness: 
  Reed didn&#8217;t kill St. Paul officer</a>), and the PiPress (<a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/local/13937834.htm" target="_blank">Witness: 
  Sackett suspect at scene. But woman says defendant &#8216;didn&#8217;t kill&#8217; 
  officer</a>), only those who don&#8217;t read this newspaper and column would 
  be surprised. </p>
<p>For over a year, the general public had been led to believe that Connie Trimble 
  (Constance Trimble-Smith), when given the opportunity to testify, would place 
  the rifle in the hands of Ronnie Reed, would have him pull the trigger and snuff 
  out the life of Officer James Sackett back on May 22, 1970, and that within 
  seconds after that terrible act, that Connie and Ron would drive half a block 
  to the home of co-defendant Larry Clark, and there Mr. Clark would take possession 
  of the weapon under his coat, go to his girl friend&#8217;s apartment, enlist 
  the aid of his girl friend&#8217;s 16 year old brother, dismantle the rifle, 
  drive back to St. Paul, and then throw it off a bridge overlooking the Mississippi 
  River. </p>
<p>Last Wednesday, February 22nd, a packed courtroom awaited testimony that would 
  finally reveal the accepted &#8220;truth&#8221; about this crime of 26 years 
  ago. Instead, to the surprise and shock of those seated in the court room, and 
  to tens of thousands who read their dailies the next morning, Connie Trimble 
  did not deliver the story arc of the government&#8217;s well crafted creative 
  narrative. She exposed the falsehood reported by the PiPress and Strib that 
  the prosecutors had an air tight case. </p>
<p>But we have shown otherwise in our reporting in 2005 of April 6, July 27, August 
  24, September 21, October 2, November 30, and, in 2006, February 15, and, today, 
  March 1 st , as well as in our July 9, 2005 web log essay of 5,181 words , which 
  including 37 questions we raised for the proscecution that are still unanswered. </p>
<p>Thus, for nearly a year, this papepr has scooped the dailies about the trial 
  and exposed their suppression of the truth. We are proud to write for a paper 
  with integrity. Is it any wonder that mainstream media like the PiPress and 
  Strib are losing subscribers, newsstand sales, readership, and advertising? </p>
<p>We see again the effort to extort another pound of flesh for Black activism 
  of 60s, as if to &#8220;send a message&#8221; to us in the 21 st century. We 
  will continue to regularly update our coverage of the trial in our special solution 
  paper, &#8220;Following the trials of Reed and Clark&#8221; on our web page, 
  that links to our columns and web log entries, pointing out the problems in 
  the case and the biased journalism of the major dailies. We know why Anderson 
  and Enron shredded evidentiary documents. We&#8217;d like to know why the evidentiary 
  documents and exhibits of Connie&#8217;s 1972 trial in Rochester (she was acquitted 
  by an all white jury) have likewise been destroyed. </p>
<p>Recall how the Sunday, February 19, 2006 St. Paul Dispatch pushed the envelop 
  with its full page story on what a strong judge and great human being Reed trial 
  presiding <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/13914517.htm" target="_blank">Judge 
  Greg Johnson</a> is. We see this as a way to distract from a weak case . This 
  is what happens when the dailies attempt to market injustice as justice. As 
  an African American, you can see the deck being steadily stacked against you. 
  We said it before, and we say it now, and unfortunately we will have to say 
  it again in the future, that this is one of the most outrageous abuses of the 
  judiciary system in the history of Minnesota law. Stay tuned, and God bless 
  Connie Trimble and her family. </p>
<p><strong>Getting ready to research you.</strong> Hennepin County has commissioned 
  a study through its NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center (the new name for <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/portal/internet/hcdetailmaster/0,2300,1273_1708_100154087,00.html" target="_blank">Pilot 
  City Health Center</a> ) to justify the creation of a Research Institute, &#8220;a 
  major interdisciplinary center involving collaboration, <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/portal/internet/hcdetailmaster/0,2300,1273_154698705_136268451,00.html" target="_blank">a 
  partnership</a>, between the University and the city of Minneapolis&#8221; under 
  the supervision of <a href="http://education.umn.edu/icd/faculty/Cicchetti.html" target="_blank">Dr. 
  Dante Cicchetti.</a> And even though Northpoint&#8217;s web site declares <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/portal/internet/hcdetailmaster/0,2300,1273_100015690_100154087,00.html" target="_blank">&#8220;we 
  are committed to helping the members of our community live happier, healthier 
  lives,&#8221;</a> we are not yet convinced, and still ask what they mean by <a href="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/vgn/images/portal/cit_100003616/47/25/136279397HUPNewsletter1.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;a 
  &#8216;living laboratory&#8217; for research purposes&#8221;</a>. Some have 
  interpreted this as a program in pre-genocide (we are still waiting for a statement 
  that says otherwise). We suggest you obtain a copy as soon as possible, particularly 
  in light of the alleged findings that African American males are a targeted 
  group with significant levels of depression and suicide. </p>
<p>The report ignores the correlation of social ills like deliberate institutionalized 
  (purposeful) poor education, purposeful blocks to economic opportunity, and 
  racism, official actions that can deteriorate the mental state of mind of a 
  human being. The report gives the impression that such Blacks folks represent 
  danger that requires preparing the camps in the tradition of Germany of the 
  1930s and 1940s we discussed in this column last year. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0604c0215" id="0604c0215"></a>February 15, 2006 Column #4:</strong> <strong>Ronald 
  Reed was correct. The continued search for justice. </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>The Minneapolis and St. Paul newspapers (Star Tribune, Pioneer Press) of February 
  7th, 8th, and 9th had a field day printing shallow stories short on facts of 
  the passionate fight being waged by Ronald Reed in the Court room of Ramsay 
  County (Ronald Reed and Larry Clark are being tried separately). </p>
<p>We wonder why the papers don&#8217;t report about the equally passionate fight 
  being waged by the court itself against Ronald Reed in that same court room. 
  This column is to help redress the imbalance. </p>
<p>We know, without fear of contradiction (and in light of Judge Johnson refusing 
  to allow Mr. Reed to read his letter to the court), that Mr. Reed has every 
  right to fear his legal representation (next time he should say he represents 
  himself, <em>pro se</em> so he can be heard). </p>
<p>Judge Greg Johnson&#8217;s actions certainly reflect a chilling atmosphere 
  and raise serious doubts regarding Mr. Reed obtaining a fair trial and prove 
  his innocence. Certainly the motion requesting a change in venue is in order. 
  The Black community saw the power of the White lynch mob in the Evans case just 
  two weeks ago in another Ramsey County courtroom, The atmosphere of hostility 
  and racism, the catcalls, the well orchestrated challenges to the few African 
  Americans allowed into the Evans trial represents a danger sign for the trials 
  of both Mr. Reed and Mr. Clark. </p>
<p>One has to question the process that allows a public defender attorney to meet 
  only six times with his client in the year since he was appointed to represent 
  him. It&#8217;s as if both the prosecution and the defense were appointed to 
  be hostile. </p>
<p>Do Mr. Reed&#8217;s attorneys feel that he is not intelligent enough or learned 
  enough to discuss trial strategy that will determine his future and his freedom? 
  We personally know that, as a witness subpoenaed to give testimony at the trial 
  of Mr. Reed, we have never talked to by Mr. Reed&#8217;s attorney. We have no 
  idea of how we would be examined. There has been no follow-up to the statements 
  we gave Mr. Reed&#8217;s investigator in the Fall of 2005. Far too frequently 
  we have seen attorneys who lacked passion, commitment or tenaciousness in defending 
  African Americans. </p>
<p>Contrary to what some may think, there aren&#8217;t many of us left who lived 
  the events of the 1960s and 1970s and who are able to speak to and identify 
  those issues, and thus provide testimony in defense of Mr. Reed and Mr. Clark. </p>
<p>We repeat again, Mr. Reed has every right to be fearful of the court given 
  its continued undermining of his franchise. Check it out: an all White jury 
  (his &#8220;peers&#8221;). A White judge, White prosecutors, and Mr. Reed&#8217;s 
  White appointed White public defenders. Is there any wonder why we question 
  whether his rights and interests will be protected? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we in America who are Black have come to know that all to often, 
  if you are black you damn well know that the deck called justice has been stacked 
  against you. </p>
<p>To better understand the way the &#8220;justice system&#8221; is treating Reed 
  and Clark, <strong>(1)</strong> read our paper: <a href="../../solutionpapers/27reedclark.htm">The 
  Solution to The Trials of Ronald Reed and Larry Clark, Is the Pursuit and Application

  Peebles: The Final Thrust! </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>If there was ever an institution committed to the final destruction of a human 
  being, it is the Minneapolis Board of Education. We have just witnessed its 
  successful campaign to destroy Superintendent Thandiwe Peebles, who resigned 
  Friday, 1-27-06 (Strib, &#8220; <a href="http://www.startribune.com/1592/story/208388.html" target="_blank">Minneapolis 
  superintendent Peebles resigns</a><strong>&#8220;) </strong>. It has been said 
  that if you want to bring down America, continue its education system the way 
  it is. In our book&#8217;s Chapter 8, we call it &#8220;Poor schools for poor 
  kids to keep them poor: clubbing the cubs into inferiority and helplessness.&#8221; 
  Indeed, we cried out then and we still cry out, &#8220;stop the clubbing and 
  teach skills, optimism, and hope.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;Last June, board members <strong>praised her academic talents&#8221; </strong>(Strib, 1-21-06, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/1592/story/196254.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Peebles 
  could be on her way out&#8221;</a>). The district web site and Strib articles 
  report her Cleveland success that she has also achieved here under her leadership: 
  &#8220;Minneapolis schools made record gains on basic skills, math and reading 
  tests.&#8221; Her reward: a Board &#8220;lynching&#8221; based on her leadership 
  style. That is always code to hide the resentment staff and board members being 
  made to actually do their jobs by strong leaders. In other words, she did the 
  job she was hired to do. Superintendent is not 9-5. Its every day and every 
  night. Which is why certain personal errands are done for her, just as they 
  ar done for the Board, and ditto government and corporate executives). </p>
<p>The final indignity was going to be the lie that she lied about her credentials, 
  that she didn&#8217;t have a doctoral degree. On the school district&#8217;s 
  web site <a href="http://www.mpls.k12.mn.us/printview/ab659ad1-0c51-4178-bf75-99afdb8e14d6.html" target="_blank">http://www.mpls.k12.mn.us/printview/ab659ad1-0c51-4178-bf75-99afdb8e14d6.html</a>, 
  it clearly states that she &#8220;<a href="http://www.mpls.k12.mn.us/printview/ab659ad1-0c51-4178-bf75-99afdb8e14d6.html" target="_blank">completed 
  her doctoral work</a>.&#8221; And this is correct. It means she completed her 
  course work, successfully passed her qualifying exams, and has completed her 
  dissertation. It has been accepted and assigned the traditional requests for 
  slight revisions (the &#8220;rite of passage&#8221; and bane of all doctoral 
  students). </p>
<p>The community was holding its collective breath, as the school board, through 
  its favorite handmaiden, Steve Brandt and the Strib, continued the drumbeat 
  to drive her out of town. The DFL politics of personal destruction continues. 
  When Senate committees vote along party lines and school boards vote on racial 
  lines (Strib today), we know the common good is not the issue. Thus the &#8220;word&#8221; 
  being quietly circulated that the Superintendent falsified her academic credentials. </p>
<p>This very clever strategy by the board to withhold The O&#8217;Brien Report 
  (Dennis O&#8217;Brien, MPS attorney, on retainer for 13 years), that investigated 
  the anonymous and false allegations accusing her of using district employees 
  to make personal phone appointments (so common in companies and government) 
  added the false credentials accusation. They painted the Superintendent into 
  a corner. How do you fight when the judging officials are proudly lying about 
  you and twisting the few facts that they receive? </p>
<p>The obsession of this board to destroy Superintendent Peeples and to flog the 
  African American community has thus reared its ugly head again. It is the Board 
  that interviewed her two years ago. It is the Board that recommended her based 
  on having asked all of the right questions in their interview. It is the Board 
  that did the appropriate examination and background checks, and thus had the 
  opportunity to evaluate her personality, demeanor, and credentials. It is the 
  Board that discovered the turn around she achieved in Cleveland. And it is the 
  Board that approved two Superintendents in the last decade who had no doctoral 
  degrees at all (Dave Jennings, Peter Hutchinson). They said it didn&#8217;t 
  matter then. But it matters now? Say what? </p>
<p>This Board would now have us believe that the problem is not them but a flawed 
  process, the key factors for which were missed. If that is the case, then the 
  Board should be the first ones removed from office. Their record speaks for 
  itself: they are incompetent and a menace to Black students&#8217; education. 
  Thandiwe Peebles was a menace to their plantation mentality for minorities. 
  And we know what that means: don&#8217;t let them read and write so they can 
  get out on their own. </p>
<p>Recall that it was this Board that wanted a strong Superintendent who was a 
  good administrator and who would carry out the responsibilities with passion, 
  and who, more than anyone, cared about the children and their progress as learners. 
  In other words, Peebles was a Superintendent who could provide the leadership 
  to drive up the test scores in math and reading and prepare our children for 
  the challenges of the 21 st century in a district that has for decades not delivered 
  to minorities. As some of us have suspected, and now clearly understand, these 
  School Board horsewomen of the apocalypse were merely playing a game and running 
  a scam to hide their sham. </p>
<p>Thandiwe Peebles has satisfied the academic standards for receiving her doctoral 
  degree. It is a mere technicality that she has not been &#8220;awarded&#8221; 
  her doctorate yet. As her bio states, she has &#8220;completed&#8221; the work. 
  Our question is why does the School Board not back the person who did her job 
  and instead fires her for doing it? And what other Board decisions are working 
  against our kids being educated and prepared to read and write. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0602c0118" id="0602c0118"></a>January 18, 2006 Column #2: Researching 
  you: analyzing the Black community</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>There was a research disaster on sexual conduct three years ago by the University 
  of Minnesota at Nellie Stone Johnson Middle School. Exposed by three teachers, 
  the university &#8220;fixed&#8221; it by blaming us. By moving their research 
  center to North Minneapolis at Plymouth and Penn, they believe they can do research 
  without being held hostage by the Black community and without having to ask 
  for permission from the Black community. </p>
<p>If the university wants to do a Tuskegee (Macon County, Alabama) <a href="http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/library/historical/medical_history/bad_blood/" target="_blank">syphilis-type 
  study</a>, or if the university wants to create a plan for out-of-home placement 
  of children and babies of color, they can, masking their work by being located 
  in our local community. (Historic footnote: From 1932-72, treatment was purposefully 
  withheld from 399 Black males in Tuskegee so the government could study the 
  effects of syphilis, a powerful example of racism in medicine, ethics and government.)</p>
<p>For 16 months, presentations have been made to the Hennepin County Board and 
  to the City of Minneapolis. So impressed, both County and City have set aside 
  $5 million each to begin the construction of this research facility at Plymouth 
  and Penn. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.psych.rochester.edu/faculty/cicchetti%20%20" target="_blank">Dr. 
  Dante Cicchetti,</a> who received his Ph.D. in <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Developmental-Psychopathology-by-Dante-Cicchetti-1995_W0QQitemZ4592072197QQcategoryZ378QQcmdZViewItem%20%20" target="_blank">developmental 
  psychology</a> from the University of Minnesota, will return to become the research 
  director. Why not for White children? Until shown differently, we view this 
  as a plan for the harvesting of little Black minds and bodies for research that 
  will be worth millions to the University of Minnesota and to the City&#8217;s 
  and County&#8217;s vendors for out-of-home placement, adoptions, etc. (Biographic 
  footnote: Cicchetti&#8217;s studies are in the area of assessment, intervention 
  and treatment of &#8220;high risk&#8221; children and their families.) </p>
<p>The university, County and City say that they already held some kind of public 
  forum in either late September or early October, and that the communities of 
  color have been told all they need to know. Why, thank ya, Boss. Where do we 
  form our Tuskegee line?</p>
<p>Some state and County insiders are saying that the research design could become 
  a national model for the dismantling of the African American family (recall 
  our book&#8217;s theme that Minneapolis wants to teach America how to put/keep 
  us in our place). Liberal/DFL policy already is at work achieving this goal. 
  Just think, these may be the first steps toward a kind of benign, compassionate 
  &#8220;genocide&#8221; in living color. </p>
<p>Why haven&#8217;t our elected officials at that meeting spoken up? That the 
  research cannot be stopped, that the center cannot be stopped, is no excuse 
  for silence. As we said in the column two weeks ago, keep an eye out for a horror 
  movie coming to your neighborhood soon.</p>
<p><strong>Punishing the Black community 15 years later </strong><br>
  Why was the Medal of Valor awarded in secret (Strib, 1-13-05, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/180824.html" target="_blank">Award 
  in fatal shooting reopens wounds</a>) to Officer Dan May of the Minneapolis 
  Police Department&#8217;s K-9 unit, who shot 17-year-old Tycel Nelson in December 
  1990? We see another example of how Minneapolis keeps trying to put us in our 
  place. The Strib reported &#8220;three undisputed facts:&#8221; Nelson was shot 
  in the back; his fingerprints were not on the revolver found later near the 
  scene; and he was wearing a black and white striped shirt. (May initially described 
  the suspect he chased as wearing a brown leather coat). </p>
<p>Can mistakes happen? Yes. But you don&#8217;t award medals of valor for mistakes. 
  Former Chief John Laux refused to approve the medal. Current Chief McManus said 
  he would not have approved had he known about it. Thus, that medal represents 
  another mean-spirited blow to the tranquility and sensibilities of the African 
  American community in general and a devastating blow in particular to the friends 
  and family of Tycel Nelson. </p>
<p>That controversial case led to the heartbreak of a community. Despite a special 
  prosecutor being appointed, the Hennepin grand jury declined to hand up an indictment. 
  Why the 15-year obsession by some in the Minneapolis Police Department with 
  making a back-shooter a hero? To punish and hold us up to ridicule? </p>
<p>This was clearly a decision orchestrated by others in positions of authority 
  and power. Chief McManus has rejected and repudiated this award and all that 
  it stands for. Does the mayor and his office do the same? We want to know. </p>
<p>And why haven&#8217;t the new city council&#8217;s African American members 
  spoken up? Where do they stand on this award and its opening of old and deep 
  wounds?</p>
<p>Why do officials seek to punish and flog the African American community? What 
  do you say to a mother who, upon hearing of this decision, was placed under 
  doctor&#8217;s care due to her anguish? What is it we have done that makes these 
  officials so hate us, that makes them view us as so lowly, to so despise us 
  and inflict such pain on a family? Why, God? What do you say to question a city 
  that has become so mean-spirited under the leadership of the Democratic Party? 
  God bless and pray for Black America.</p>

  THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORDINANCE</strong><strong>: Minneapolis continues to show America

<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>When Neal St. Anthony (Star Tribune, February 21, 2005), wrote about the purchase 
  of MPI by its employees (see our December 14 th column), it sounded like the 
  beginning of the great American dream for these Somalis and African Americans, 
  who scraped together $480,000 to purchase MPI from the Leamington Group of the 
  Bob Short empire. </p>
<p>City hall conspirators knew that within less than 10 months, MPI would be out 
  of business and their dream destroyed by fellow Blacks and the DFL party. Who 
  among them or us would have believed them.
