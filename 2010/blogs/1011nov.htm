<p><strong>--CONTINUOUSLY BREAKING NEWS  FOR 15 YEARS<br>
IS FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED--</strong></p>
<p><strong>The columns of <a href="https://www.theminneapolisstory.com/2010/columns/10q4.htm#1047c1124" target="_blank">11-24-10</a> and <a href="https://www.theminneapolisstory.com/2010/columns/10q4.htm#1046c1117" target="_blank">11-17-10</a></strong> not only report 15 years late what   we have known for 15 years, that there has been a tremendous disparity in hiring and wages between whites and Blacks, the  Disparity Report also cries out for an answer to the question of why neither the Civil Rights Commission nor the City Council have  called for hearings about it now that the shameful Disparity Report has finally been released. Hearins need to be held  to investigate why Minneapolis &quot;does not monitor compliance <em>during</em> performance in contracts and employment&quot;.  The Civil Rights Commission has the authority, by statute to call such hearings (I know, as I was a member from 1968-1983, including being Chairman, and in those days we called such hearings). The Commission must call public hearings and take testimony on this Disparity Stud that details the denial of jobs to African Americans and, thus, the economic rape of  African American economic opportunities and, thus, the denial of its access to the wealth of this city. Half the Commision is appointed by the Council, half by the Mayor.&nbsp; Are they blocking hearings? There must be public hearings to hear from the Civil Rights Department, from citizens, and from the Council as to why this has been allowed to happen. For more information,  see my blog entry of <a href="https://www.theminneapolisstory.com/2009/blogs/0908aug.htm#0908b0828"><strong>August 28, 2009</strong></a>, in which I list 12 of the columns I&rsquo;ve written on this subject since 2005.<br>
