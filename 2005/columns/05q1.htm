<p><strong><a name="0506c0323" id="0506c0323"></a>March 23, 2005 Column #6: Another &#8216;plan&#8217; 
to save Black youths</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em><em><br>
  </em><br>
  A plan to &#8220;save&#8221; Black youths with 300 to 500 summer jobs was announced 
  last Wednesday, March 16, at a State Capital press conference. The overall purpose 
  was to talk about public safety and new crime-fighting money. 
<p>On Thursday, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1557/5297252.html" target="_blank">March 
  17, the <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> reported</a> on an email 
  from African American police Sergeant Robert Berry about the crime scene's contamination. 
  There have been editorials and at least 10 feature stories in the <em>Star Tribune</em> 
  since that tragic afternoon of March 4, 2005. But what is troubling to this 
  corner is that these events have become a political three-ring circus, with 
  folks in one ring seeing some money to be made, while others in another ring 
  see political leverage to be gained. The DFL has rigged the city's political 
  contest to eliminate 50 percent of the city council's African Americans by gerrymandering 
  the contest such that it pits the only two African American incumbents, Natalie 
  Johnson Lee and Don Samuels, against each other. <p>
  And in the center ring we have Boss Man himself prancing about, expecting the 
  paying African American patrons to get all warm and mushy because Boss Man is 
  allegedly going to give our youths 300 to 500 summer jobs. My gawd, how often 
  have we heard that song? They get the headlines. Our youth get a number that 
  doesn't come close to the number promised.<p>
  In the meantime, as the Whites continue their circus show, we find no plan to 
  include in any of the rings acts that will do anything to preserve the lives 
  and the futures of the children of our African American communities. We'll continue 
  to monitor city hall's minstrel show.
<p> <strong>And about those &#8220;plans&#8221; to save our youth:</strong> Nothing 
  has changed since Nellie Stone Johnson's prescient insight&#8212;no education, 
  no jobs, no housing. When the legislature and city councils address our solutions 
  listed in our book [Chapter 17] and on our website [Solution Paper #22, <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">&#8220;7 
  Themes/Prblems/Solutions,&#8221;</a> and Solution Paper #23, <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">&#8220;The 
  Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All To Sit at Together,&#8221;</a> 
  we&#8217;ll know they want a community of citizens and not just a grandstand 
  of passive patrons as they throw us crumbs in the hopes we'll stay in &#8220;our 
  place.&#8221; 
<p>
  More troubling is that our own Black organizations don't lobby to have these 
  solutions considered. Enacting them will solve the problems of education, jobs, 
  housing, violence and public safety.<p>
  <strong>Mike, say it isn't so. Wow. Scalping for years. </strong><br>
  Have you noticed the silence of the White fourth estate on Mike Tice's confession 
  that one of the examples he has set has been to break NFL rules by scalping &#8216;05 tickets of his about-to-be-sold Minnesota Vikings football team? This is 
  like watching parallel universes. <p>
  Check these headlines. <strong>March 9:</strong> &#8220;Tice denies scalping 
  Super Bowl tickets.&#8221; <strong>March 10</strong>: &#8220;Tice is confident 
  he'll be cleared.&#8221; <strong>March 11:</strong> &#8220;Tice says he scalped 
  &#8216;05 tickets.&#8221; So he lies and denies; then, when he's exposed and 
  fesses up, the ***Strib*** goes silent. Then we turn to a parallel universe 
  on those same dates. <strong>March 9:</strong> &#8220;Vikings sale not likely 
  this month.&#8221; <strong>March 10:</strong> &#8220;Fowler bid discussed, but 
  action not taken.&#8221; <strong>March 11:</strong> &#8220;Fowler's bid for 
  Vikings moves slowly toward approval.&#8221; <p>
  We have had all kinds of innuendo about Reggie's dealings. Mike is actually 
  guilty and nary a word. So let's ask the questions the Strib doesn't. Hey, Mike: 
  Who is your ticket broker? How much did you really sell them for, and how much 
  did you really get for them? Have you notified the IRS of your new &#8220;income&#8221;? 
  And hey, Red: What disciplinary action will you take, or is lying an &#8220;aw 
  shucks&#8221; thing of White boys being White boys? <p>
  Heck, this thing has so disappeared from the radar screen that, if we wait long 
  enough, they can pretend it didn't happen. But we will remember. It makes us 
  wonder what the reaction would have been had this been a Black coach, or, horror 
  of horrors, Dennis Green. I guess Mike didn't use his pencil to take notes when 
  Coach Green talked about integrity.<p>
  <strong>Steve, don't worry, we haven't forgotten you. </strong>Many have told 
  me they are waiting for my response to the letter written to this paper two 
  weeks ago on our column of a month ago about violence in the Minneapolis public 
  schools. <p>
  Some within the school administration think we were put in our place. How? The 
  violence happened. The threats were made. The truth will come out in court. 
  For the school's, sake I hope they were not taped when they were threatening 
  about careers and futures with the Minneapolis Public Schools. We look forward 
  to following this circus, too, as lawsuits are prepared and the court sessions 
  begin. Best of luck, 807.

<p><strong><a name="0505c0309" id="0505c0309"></a>March 9, 2005 Column #5: Sale of the 
  Vikings: the race card in play</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>With the announcement of the trade of Randy Moss to the Oakland Raiders, it 
  is quite clear that forces are at work that are giving no consideration to Reggie 
  Fowler. </p>
<p>I mean, come on. Do you really believe Reggie was considered or consulted before 
  this trade? And some of the suspicion that Reggie is being sucker-punched was 
  confirmed in the wave of articles in the last Thursday&#8217;s <em>Star Tribune</em> 
  (March 3). One was headlined &#8220;Silent Partners&#8217; Deep Pockets.&#8221; 
  The Strib assigned five writers to this article, four of them identified under 
  the byline. Another, on p. A9, by Jay Weiner talks about an old Fowler friend, 
  Black business executive Jim Stapleton, former Sr. VP with the Detroit Tigers. 
  Now, the story looked pretty good, as it talked about two old acquaintances 
  that were teaming up to make history. But then, at the very end of the story, 
  the knife across the throat comes into play when the Star Tribune points out 
  that Stapleton was involved in a $185,000 illegal fee to broker a sale between 
  a technology company and the Detroit Public Schools. Although the paper quotes 
  Stapleton as denying any wrongdoing, the paper goes on to report that in June 
  2004 he settled the matter in U.S. bankruptcy court for $50,000. </p>
<p>The lead story about Fowler&#8217;s partners played the religion card (the 
  race card having already been played). Note how it makes a point to state that 
  one of the investors supports many Jewish causes. Naturally. All three of Fowler&#8217;s 
  partners are Jewish. </p>
<p>Many of us in this city remember how vicious and anti-Semitic it became in 
  the final days of the beloved Max Winter, the Jewish man who brought the Vikings 
  to Minnesota. And when that ugly battle to see who would take control of the 
  Minnesota Vikings was joined, a level of anti-Semitism not seen in this city 
  since the 1930s reared its ugly head. </p>
<p>At some point, someone in this once-great city is going to have to say enough 
  is enough. With America&#8217;s sons and daughters dying in foreign wars irrespective 
  of race, creed, religion or national origin, how is it that we have a war here 
  in Minnesota over a football team that could very well put that conflict to 
  journalistic shame? Shame on the Fourth Estate. </p>
<p><strong>Best wishes, Reggie</strong></p>
<p>We are amazed at the &#8220;waves&#8221; of <em>Star Tribune</em> stories about 
  Reggie&#8217;s purchase of the team from Red. First the attempt to abort the 
  sale, then stories of the announcement making Reggie look silly, then the nonsensical 
  resume flap, then total silence, then the March 3 wave. We submitted our copy 
  for this issue Thursday night, March 3. By the time this paper is published 
  on the ninth, you will have been treated to the wave of Sunday, March 6, in 
  a last-ditch effort to discredit Reggie. For an update, see our long and detailed 
  post of 2-28-05: <a href="../../solutionpapers/25reggieforowner.htm">&#8220;Who&#8217;s 
  Dream: All or some? Reggie Fowler is qualified to be the Minnesota Vikings Owner&#8221;</a>, 
  our &#8220;Solutions Paper #25&#8221;, and subsequent Blog (web log) entries. 
</p>
<p>We want Reggie to succeed. As we posted those, we also submitted them to Reggie&#8217;s 
  team. Our fear now is that they are playing into the hands of locals who don&#8217;t 
  want a Black owner or locals giving them bad advice. </p>
<p>The NFL would like to approve Reggie, but he and his team are making it harder 
  and harder for the NFL to do so. Nonetheless, we wish them continued good fortune 
  with their purchase. We hope he proves us wrong and gets approved.</p>
<p><strong>Continued violence in the halls of education</strong></p>
<p>Last Wednesday&#8217;s edition of the <em>Star Tribune</em> (March 2) was clearly 
  a case of it once again playing catch-up with this column. We had reported the 
  previous week on the violence in the Minneapolis Public Schools, the assault 
  on administrators, the concern within the Hispanic community, the concern within 
  the Black community, and the effort by both communities to be heard. </p>
<p>At that time they were heard only by this columnist in this newspaper. We welcome 
  the Strib catching up, but wonder why they purposefully ignore such stories 
  until called out. </p>
<p>Contrary to the statement attributed in the March 2 article in the <em>Star 
  Tribune</em>, our communities are not a bunch of hypocrites. The hypocrites 
  are those within the school district who would mislead the general public, saying 
  they had no idea that these incidents were taking place. Hypocrisy brings with 
  it dishonesty, and that dishonesty fosters more hypocrisy. We hope the meeting 
  that is supposed to be held on this issue comes off. Note that the meeting has 
  been pushed back from March 10 to March 15. We are urge the Hispanic community 
  to move forward with the federal action they have under consideration. Stay 
  tuned.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0504c0224" id="0504c0224"></a>February 24, 2005 Column #4: </strong><strong>(1) 
  Don&#8217;t ask me about safety in the Minneapolis Public Schools, 
  (2) Black men need not apply for membership in the NFL? A &quot;teachable&quot; 
  moment for white America</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>How would you like to be a teacher assaulted by students, injured, and hospitalized, 
  and have the fact erased? This &#8220;Erasure&#8221; happened to an African 
  American Vice Principal at Franklin Middle School. Over two weeks ago. Assaulted 
  by students, injured, hospitalized. As of 2-17-05, no incident report had been 
  filed by the Minneapolis Park Police (which has jurisdiction). This column has 
  confirmed the hospitalization. A citation/ticket was issued to the perpetrator. 
  The assault and beating of the Black vice principal was described while the 
  Park Board liaison police officer was present in the room. So where is the official 
  written report? And why is the incident denied and erased?
<p> The vice principal has been told that the school district and the park police 
  now insist no assault took place, so that if she insists upon pursuing this 
  matter her career and job security are at risk. So the schools really can&#8217;t 
  teach math (assault + injury + hospitalization + report + citation = 0). More 
  disturbing: the Minneapolis Star Tribune won&#8217;t report this story. This 
  column has acquired violence incident figures from the Hennepin County Attorney&#8217;s 
  office. Schools claims to be safe but incidents of crimes in schools are at 
  a record level, with 1,177 incidents in 2003-2004, with this year on pace to 
  exceed 1,177. Denial. Erasure. Cover-up.<p>
  It gets worse. Hispanic parents protesting the increase in violence against 
  their children have also been told that there is no problem in the schools. 
  Denial. Erasure. Cover up. Why? Is it any wonder that so many educators live 
  in fear of the environment of terror in the Minneapolis Public Schools? What 
  can be done? If you are concerned and have any ideas, let me know, and I&#8217;ll 
  pass them on. 
<p><strong>Black men need not apply for membership in the NFL </strong><p>
      The Minneapolis Star Tribune, WCCO, other local networks, the NY Times, 
      USA Today, etc., show us a new kind of lunch counter refusal. In the chapters 
      of our book, we pulled &#8220;the covers off and exposed&#8221; racism as 
      we fought for a Minneapolis &#8220;table for everyone.&#8221; Don&#8217;t 
      be fooled by the latest laughing about Reggie Fowler&#8217;s resume. It 
      is part of the orchestrated turn down. Resumes have different purposes &#8211; 
      job hunting (detailed specifics), background for clients and customers (generalizations) 
      and the public servant or public view piece (to show appropriateness). Each 
      are different. There is no O&#8217;Leary moment here.<p>
      But even before that came to light, it was already clear to us that (1) 
      Red was using Reggie to set a floor for his price, (2) Anoka County was 
      crying wolf to keep from paying a stadium tax while (3) making sure people 
      realize there was a need for the team and stadium in Minnesota after all, 
      to help them fulfill their development dream, (4) Glen Taylor was preparing 
      to &#8220;catch&#8221; the team and fulfill his long held dream, (5) the 
      Governor was getting more support for his Minneapolis to St. Cloud corridor 
      dream, while (6) the legislature will use the voters&#8217; dream that a 
      Black guy didn&#8217;t get the Vikings to (7) cause a Minnesota swoon for 
      the team going to Taylor, so the legislators will (8) be able to fulfill 
      their dream of creating a stadium tax and not lose an election for doing 
      so, and (9) the NFL can say they tried.<p>
      Those of us who have had to deal with the very low, cement (not glass) inner 
      city ceiling for Blacks caused by 250 years of slavery, 90 years of jim 
      crow, and nearly 50 years of kerner commissioned inner city apartheid policies 
      know color IS playing a big part in this. Have you noticed that we in this 
      column and in this paper are the only media in America on record openly 
      supporting this sale to this prospective first Black owner, unqualifiedly, 
      with no innuendos?<p>
      Think of it: until now: no NFL Black owners. Over 70% black players. Only 
      1% black head coaches (and that is a recent increase). Only a ruckus forced 
      the Rooney Rule (that Blacks have to be interviewed for head coach too). 
      And yet at the Super Bowl this year NFL Commissioner Tagliabue, blaming 
      the universities, said there is no depth in the Black executive ranks of 
      the NFL. So no Rooney Rule for front offices. In other words, they not only 
      don&#8217;t have to hire Black executives, they don&#8217;t even have to 
      interview them. In other words, Blacks need not apply.<p>
      Becoming the first Black owner in the NFL is like riding a huge, historic, 
      tectonic plate moving earthquake inducing Tsunami crashing over the last 
      great White-only seawall barrier. 
<p> If ever there was a teachable moment for White America, this is it. This could 
  have been done so smoothly and wonderfully that people would have been clamoring 
  for this sale to go through, shouting, &#8220;it&#8217;s about time&#8221;. 
  Instead, the Fowler group seems to have hired Minneapolis firms that join in 
  the clamor for putting up the &#8220;Blacks need not apply&#8221; signs.

  Enemy, Same Plan, New War?</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p> We all watched the President&#8217;s State of the Union Speech (SOTUS) with 
  great interest. He was a man in command. And certainly, by the grumble of boos 
  expressed by some democrats regarding Iraq and Social Security, he was also 
  a man opposed. He returned the favor periodically with his facial expressions 
  suggesting annoyance and displeasure.<p>
      But for this columnist, of greater concern was the report widely circulated 
      prior to Wednesday&#8217;s SOTUS, on January 31st and February 1st and 2nd, 
      that the United States government had determined that a significant amount 
      of Libyan uranium, weapons grade in design, had come from North Korea. Conservative 
      commentators then said this was the smoking gun that justified a preemptive 
      strike against North Korea. Does it? We need dialogue. But both of our political 
      parties so vilify each other that each side refrains from stating what they 
      are thinking because of the swarm than will surround them, as each sees 
      the other not as an opposition that wants to discuss but an opposition that 
      wants to defeat.<p>
      Remember Vice President Cheney&#8217;s well designed response in an interview 
      indicating that the United States would not be able to keep Israel back 
      from preemptively striking Iran (which Europeans may secretly want). The 
      thoughts that ran through my mind were the following: More wars? More casualties? 
      More of our sons and daughters maimed and wounded? More stirring of the 
      international community? Would this make us crusaders out to save the unfree, 
      undemocratic world without thought of consequence? Is there another way 
      to free enslaved people as many are, from our standards, in the Middle East? 
      We need to discuss this as a nation if we are to maintain a high moral standard 
      and be the model we want others to follow to institute peaceful change and 
      become democratic. <p>
      Are polls correct that the President has a mandate? Is preemption the leading 
      card to play in foreign policy? Will Condoleezza Rice be able to bring about 
      an international consensus/action regarding Syria, Egypt, Iran, and North 
      Korea such that needed change can be made without war? How do we avoid war 
      while standing up for and helping in the liberation of oppressed peoples? 
      In our web log 2005#6 of January 29, we asked two questions: &#8220;Does 
      the President speak for the inner city too?&#8221; and Who does the DFL 
      speak for?&#8221; 
<p> Is the President trying to draw our attention away from the domestic landscape, 
  such as social security, jobs and a serious and sincere revitalization of the 
  inner cities of color in America? He should tell us. Actions speak louder than 
  words. I need to see corresponding action. We know that the survival of Black 
  America depends on our being vigilant. Where is the vigilance in Minneapolis? 
  Why is so little going on during February, Black History month? Do we no longer 
  pay attention to and celebrate the life and teachings of Martin Luther King, 
  Jr.? Some men seem terrified. Of what? Some men seem lazy and lost? Why? What 
  happened to Black manhood? In our column of December 16, 2004 (2004/#26), we 
  asked if we were looking at Black men as an &#8220;Endangered Species&#8221; 
  and wondered about &#8220;The Future of Black Men in Minneapolis,&#8221; as, 
  in the wake of the killing of the young boy, we asked, &#8220;where are our 
  so-called Black leaders? No civil rights organization spoke up or cried out 
  or seemed to care.&#8221;
<p>
      In our October 7, 2004 column (2004/#20), we noted that despite the fact 
      that the White &#8220;Plantation mentality denies Blacks $15 million,&#8221; 
      there was no protest, only &#8220;silence&#8221; except for this column. 
      Are the men of Minneapolis no longer man-like? Why didn&#8217;t any of the 
      organizations cut off stand up for that $15 million? Why be beaten and bowed? 
      Are they waiting for Boss to hand them something? We saw real Black men 
      in my book in Interlude 9 (the Pullman Porters), Interlude 11 (Adam Clayton 
      Powell), and Interlude 13 (the Army veterans prepared to fight the Tulsa 
      Race Riots Against Blacks). What is happening to us in Minneapolis that 
      we can&#8217;t stand up for ourselves? Each will have to look into their 
      own heart and soul. Will we be vigilant or just try to get by? <p>
      In 1905, in Buffalo, NY, a predecessor organization to the NAACP was formed 
      from The Niagra Movement that opposed Booker T. Washington&#8217;s accommodation 
      policies because White America incorrectly interpreted it as meaning they 
      could keep the status quo. The Niagra Movement said, &#8220;We want full 
      manhood suffrage and we want it now. &#8230; We are men! We want to be treated 
      as men. We will win.&#8221; Is it time for another organization to in turn 
      supplant the NAACP, one that can stand up, man-like?<p>
  Hey Emmitt Smith: even though you say in the 2-3-05 Dallas Morning News and 
  our Star Tribune that you are not involved with the Fowler group&#8217;s attempt 
  to buy the Vikings, know this: if its not true, go ahead and think about it; 
  join their ownership team. To us in Purple country, you will always be a star 
  that is Welcome!

A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p> <strong>[Ed note:</strong> <em><a href="../../solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm">the &#8220;Roll 
  Call&#8221; of those supporting The Plan to have the Vikings leave</a> is appended 
  to this web version of this column.</em>]  
<p> <strong>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</strong> was published in October 
  2000. Chapter 15 was devoted to the Vikings: &#8220;Say goodbye, they are leaving, 
  that is the plan&#8221; (to sell to an outsider, to move the team or sell to 
  some one who will). I write this week to again expose the plan and to expose 
  the latest hunt for a new Great White Hope. 
<p>On public TV last week, Ken Burns captured the seething racism of the early 
  20th century and the furious search for a &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; to 
  beat Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight champion of the world. Sid Hartman 
  has anointed T-Wolves owner Glenn Taylor as the Great White Hope to prevent 
  Black entrepreneur Reggie Fowler from becoming the Black owner of our beloved 
  Nordic Vikings. Sid's column headline last Thursday screamed with joy: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">FOWLER 
  DOESN'T HAVE CAPITAL TO BUY VIKINGS.</a> 
<p> Sid then writes, &#8220;There isn't any doubt that the league will do all 
  it can to make sure Taylor owns the team, if there is going to be a change in 
  ownership.&#8221; I understand Sid&#8217;s White supremacy (we're 90 percent 
  White here). But why the NFL's, when over half their players are Black? This 
  is just a &quot;block the Black&quot; ploy: if Glenn really wanted the team, 
  he would have bought it already. 
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Allow Mr. Fowler to follow Red into the ownership 
  Red Zone the same way Red and the former owners did. Have the NFL loan Mr. Fowler 
  the money, as was the case with Red (and the owners before him took out loans 
  too, making their payments from Vikings revenue). To beat homeboy Roger Hedrick&#8217;s 
  bid, the NFL loaned Red $100 million to out-bid Roger (see San Antonio Express-News, 
  August 8, 2002) and then would not let Roger counter. 
<p> The article noted the &#8220;complex hedge transaction.&#8221; Why isn't Mr. 
  Fowler being accorded the same courtesy of the same financial wizardry? Isn't 
  the real price for the team $455 million (the $600 million Red wants minus the 
  $145 million in debt carried forward), and arrange to pay that amount once a 
  new stadium is built? Is it because Mr. Fowler wants to keep the team in Minneapolis 
  and not move it? 
<p>As chairman of the Sports Facility Commission (which runs the Metrodome), Henry 
  Savakoul unleashed in October 1988 &#8220;The Move Plan with his &#8220;<strong>chilling</strong>&#8221; 
  speech, &#8220;The Viability of Four Major Sports Teams in Minnesota,&#8221; 
  saying corporate Minnesota saw only three teams as viable. They didn't want 
  to buy four sets of suites (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL), so one pro team had to go&#8212;the 
  Vikings. 
<p>The <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> reporter Jay Weiner echoed this 
        in his 2000 book <em>Stadium Games: 50 Years of Big League Greed and Bush 
        League Boondoggles</em> (University of Minnesota Press, 2000). 
       
<p>Now how rhapsodic Jay Weiner waxes rhapsodically regarding the Vikes leaving 
  for L.A., as he doesin his July 20, 2003 <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1557/3995618.html" target="_blank">article</a>. 
  Killer quote: &#8220;Done right, with a new stadium in the proper location&#8212;even 
  a stadium with zero public funding&#8212;an NFL franchise&#8230;has the chance 
  to be a gold mine for its owner&#8221; [the key being a <strong>NEW</strong> 
  stadium]. 
<p>In <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</em> we talked about our vision 
  vs. &#8220;The Plan&#8221; in terms ofthe disastrous loss of the Northstars 
  Hockey team and how the Twin Cities could build three stadiums (Vikings, Twins, 
  Gophers) or build one each for the Vikes and Gophers and remodel the dome for 
  the Twins. 
<p>Last week, Jay Weiner echoed us (Star Tribune, January 19, 2005, with his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5193272.html" target="_blank">Stadium 
  Solutions: A Potential Timeline</a> for building <strong>three</strong> new 
  stadiums. It reads just like our book, where we pointed out that all three could 
  be built without new taxes. Imitation is a form of flattery. (Jay, Sid, Doug, 
  TJ, and various editors were all given copies of our book in 2002.) 
<p>In 2000, my publisher sent a package to the teams, the governor, and key legislators 
  regarding how to construct three stadiums without having to raise new taxes, 
  and posted it on his website, <a href="http://www.peterjesssen-gpa.com" target="_blank">www.peterjesssen-gpa.com</a>, 
  which also lists the names of the recipients he sent it to. No one called him. 
<p>The $1 billion the city has wasted just in housing planning (my book, 
        Chapter 8, p. 131) would have paid for three stadiums. Whereas Minneapolis 
        was once a city of vision, now it is a city where the offspring of the 
        wealthy founders are weak, lacking vision, believing they deserve being 
        born rich. With such great blessings, they should be marching arm in arm 
        to city hall to proclaim they will invest in building the stadiums, finance 
        them, and get their money back running them as businesses rather than 
        as tax-supported welfare programs. 
       
<p>It is time for the pampered offspring of Minnesota's wealthy founders to step 
  up to the plate and show their appreciation for not being born in the &#8216;hood. 
<p> Thanks to you who express appreciation for our being the best column 
        after column, better than the Strib and saying our journalism is as worthy 
        as the reporting on Watergate and the Pentagon Papers. Thank you. We know 
        how to sort out hard information and facts from soft information, rumor, 
        envy and wishful thinking. 
      
<p> You can bet your Vikings that we would like the Strib to acknowledge just 
  once that we know what we are talking about. <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eye</em>s continues to be as up-to-date as the date it was published. Is 
  this why the Strib still refuses to acknowledge it or review it?

<p><strong><a name="0501c0112" id="0501c0112"></a>January 12, 2005 Column #1: </strong><strong>Plantation 
  University: When Can Their Words be Trusted?</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>A little over a month ago, the ***Minneapolis Star Tribune&#8217;s*** Dennis 
  Bracken wrote an interesting story about the student-athlete graduation rates 
  of the University of Minnesota and in the Big 10 (see our column of December 
  16, 2004, on "The U of M plantation"). 
<p>The statistics were disappointing; graduation rates were at the bottom, 
        and graduation rates for African American student-athletes even worse. 
        Two separate entities were looking at this issue, the NCAA and a research 
        group at Central Florida University. 
      <p>With the exception of Charles Hallman, sports columnist for this newspaper, 
        and yours truly, no one has uttered a word of concern. We expected, or 
        at least we hoped, that the president of the University and the chairman 
        of the Board of Regents would at least make the disaster of Black athletes 
        an item for public discussion. 
       
<p>Unfortunately, that has not yet happened. And why am I not surprised? The January 
  4 edition of the ***Star Tribune*** ran the interesting story &#8220;Mason fires 
  two assistant coaches&#8221; (Richard Wilson, the wide receivers coach, and 
  Tom Sims, the defensive line coach). This was somewhat shocking, as less than 
  a week earlier Head Coach Mason had said he intended to retain his entire coaching 
  staff. Obviously, that was not the truth. 
<p>But what was even more troubling was that Wilson and Sims were two of the three 
  African American coaches on Mason&#8217;s staff. When asked about the perception 
  of these firings, Athletic Director Joe Maturi expressed total indifference 
  to the reduction of African American participation at the coaching level and, 
  of course, did not even attempt to address the inconsistency with truth in the 
  case of Coach Mason. 
<p>Now, here is the observation from this corner. We already know that we 
        have a coach, Mason, who is at best indifferent to the fact that, for 
        whatever reasons, his African American student athletes are not attaining 
        their degrees. It is quite clear that all Mason and Maturi are concerned 
        about is that the African American student athletes perform on the field 
        of competition while he, Coach Mason, draws his salary and bonuses. Meanwhile, 
        some students leave the university with nothing more that what they came 
        there with. 
       
<p>A degree should not be an option! African American parents expect a White coach 
  coming into their living room, asking them to entrust the future of their son 
  or daughter into their hands, to do what is best for the future of that student 
  athlete&#8212;to see that he or she graduates. 
<p>It is clear that Coach Mason and the University of Minnesota have broken the 
  most important rule of trust in recruiting the African American student athlete. 
  They have done as Mastuh has always done by lying about their sincere concern 
  for the future of the students with whom they have been entrusted. As I wrote 
  in my book, &#8220;The University continues to accept Blacks for what they can 
  do for them in athletics but not as people.&#8221;
<p>Now, with the exception of Charles Hallman of this newspaper, I don&#8217;t 
  think graduation rates or the fates of Black assistant coaches and future coaches 
  at the university and related issues will come up for discussion. The institution 
  we call the University of Minnesota works like the old plantation, and that 
  is to bring them in, work them to death, cast them out, and hope that they go 
  away and die. 
<p><strong>On the other side of the plantation</strong>
<p> By the time this column appears, the results of the game in Green Bay will 
  be history. But there is something peculiar about the Minnesota Vikings, and 
  that is the same continuous pattern of collapse for the past two years. 
<p>Sometimes a team falls apart when they lose respect for the head man 
        (and all NFL teams have two heads, those of the owner and the coach). 
        And sometimes head men lose that confidence by not treating their players 
        of color like men. 
      <p>So what is this about? It is to discourse with Vikings fans and cause 
        them not to care. It sure seems that way from the front-page story in 
        the January 6 ***Star Tribune***. They certainly don't sound like happy 
        fans. 
       
<p>Is this Red&#8217;s way of getting people not to care when the team is moved, 
  or sold and then moved? Look forward to the rest of the year.
