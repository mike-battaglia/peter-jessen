<p><strong><a name="1301b0411" id="0830b"></a>04-11-13, #1:  </strong><strong>Legislative double-cross? Why? </strong><strong>To make them move to L.A. or to distort more money from them and the NFL?</strong> <strong>Can't just be confusion.</strong></p>
<p>April 11, 2013</p>
<p><strong>When you break a deal or try to, you lose both credibility and trust</strong>.&nbsp; Recent proposed legislation, whether passed or not, has broken the credibility and trust developed with the Vikings.&nbsp; As Yogi Berra said, &ldquo;D&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this another inning or quarter in Minnesota&rsquo;s perennial <em>Stadium Games</em> (2000 book by Star Tribune sports writer Jay Weiner, with subtitle, <em>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stadium-Games-Fifty-League-Boondoggles/dp/0816634343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366276107&sr=8-1&keywords=stadium+games" target="_blank"><strong>Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggles</strong></a>).</em>&nbsp; From Minnesota nice to Minnesota nasty:&nbsp; what the legislators are proposing to do, from the Star Tribune, KMSP-TV, and NFL links:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/202610631.html">Legislator asks for larger Vikings commitment to stadium</a></strong> <br>
  <strong><a href="http://www.nflgridirongab.com/vikings-stadium-plans-could-be-on-hold-by-state/">Vikings Stadium Plans Could Be On Hold By State</a></strong><br>
  <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/201538901.html">Bill would put Vikings stadium on hold</a></strong><br>
  <strong><a href="file://localhost/AT%20THE%20CAPITOL/%20Stadium%20funding,%20Mayo%20expansion,%20gay%20marriage%20-%20KMSP-TV%20http/::www.myfoxtwincities.com:story:21937468:at-the-capitol-stadium-funding-mayo-expansion-marriage-equality#ixzz2Q8m4LcDh">AT THE CAPITOL: Stadium funding</a></strong><br>
  <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/202343771.html">Dayton's stadium chief backs pro sports gear tax</a></strong> <br>
  <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/201946381.html">Racino proposed as answer for Vikings stadium and budget</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Proposed Doublecross as taken from the preceding links:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; For Minnesota to slash $200 million from its $348 million commitment, proposed out of panic as the electronic pull tabs that were to pay the state&rsquo;s portion is only bringing in 5% of what was projected.<br>
  2.&nbsp; Delay issuance of bonds for the stadium until viable revenue source are found/created.<br>
  3.&nbsp; Extend sales tax to luxury boxes and seat licenses<br>
  4. &nbsp;10% tax on athletic memorabilia:&nbsp; the only acceptable part of the doublecross, but too little too late<br>
  5.&nbsp; Ill-advised action hiding behind the skirts of false &ldquo;do goodism:&rdquo; that the stadium will &ldquo;take money from education, health care and maintaining roads.&rdquo;&nbsp; If so, why were new stadiums built for the Gophers, Twins, Wild, and &nbsp;with proposed upgrading for Timber Wolves?<br>
  6.&nbsp; Remember:&nbsp; Stadium and arena promises were broken to Bob Short, Norm Green, and Red McCombs. Now the Wilfs.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Consequences of the Proposed Doublecross</strong><br>
  1.&nbsp; Vikings and the NFL won&rsquo;t play Revenue Roulette:&nbsp; they won&rsquo;t pull the trigger on the Vikings<br>
  2.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t force the Vikings and the NFL to put up more money<br>
  3.&nbsp; Will more than likely force the Vikings to L.A.<br>
  4.&nbsp; Kelm-Helgen, Authority Chair, correctly notes that the luxury seat proposal infringes on the deal struck by state negotiators<br>
  5.&nbsp; Hence Lester Bagley, Vikings vice president, correctly points out that the proposal &quot;would dramatically change the deal that was negotiated and ratified by the Legislature in May of 2012.&quot;&nbsp; Why would the Vikings trust the state and city again? <br>
  6.&nbsp; Will cause cost increases.&nbsp; New 49er stadium will now need $29 million in design changes and another $50 million <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Cost-of-49ers-Santa-Clara-stadium-now-1-2-billion-3406744.php">for emerging technology&nbsp;upgrades</a>.&nbsp; What design and technology upgrades (and their costs) will become necessary after a 1-2 year delay in Minnesota?&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Revenue realities behind the Proposed Doublecross</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000151802/article/atlanta-city-council-oks-plan-for-new-falcons-stadium">Owner of Atlanta, GA NFL Falcons to pay $800 million of the proposed $1 billion retractable-roof stadium</a>, with the remaining $200 million public contribution to be paid by a city hotel-motel tax.&nbsp; But the Falcons owner is a billionaire; the Vikings owner is only a millionaire.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Owners of MLB team in San Francisco paid for their stadium:&nbsp; but this is not San Francisco</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The public contribution to the <strong><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Cost-of-49ers-Santa-Clara-stadium-now-1-2-billion-3406744.php">San Francisco 49ers new stadium</a></strong> of $800 million will be covered by seat and suite sales (if the latter don&rsquo;t cover it the team will make up the difference but at current rate of sales in post-Super Bowl fever, they expect to make more that the $800 million. &nbsp;Here is a big difference:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8268ad55/article/nfl-will-help-49ers-pay-for-new-stadium-in-santa-clara">&ldquo;The 49ers team loaned Santa Clara $400 million, the NFL loaned out $200 million.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp; &ldquo;The first team to draw from the so-called &quot;new stadium fund&quot; that came out of the league's new collective bargaining agreement.&rdquo; </a>&nbsp;Never the less, they are LOANS.&nbsp; But Minnesota has no Silicon Valley, and no longer has 19 Fortune 500 companies in the region with their highly paid employees able to buy expensive seats.&nbsp; And the 49ers took years to work it out; Minnesota kept avoiding real negoatiations and then did it hastily.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/201946381.html">Racino proposed as answer for Vikings stadium and budget</a></strong>would not get tribal approval. </p>
<p><strong>Solutions:&nbsp; Begin with My Solution Paper #47:&nbsp; </strong><strong>SAVE THE VIKINGS! OR DO THEY MOVE? &nbsp;</strong>Includes key columns since 2000, &nbsp;my 2002 chapter on the Vikings, my 2003 roll call of those opposed to the Vikings staying in Minnesota. </p>
<p>I proposed answers to key solution questions as proposed to the State, City and the Vikings, all ignored, including: </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; My December 11, 2011, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/47SaveVikings.htm" target="_blank">Stadium Solution Paper #47</a> (and updated since) </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My 2002 book, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/abt_book.htm" target="_blank">The Minneapolis Story: Through My Eyes</a>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; January 29, 2005, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm" target="_blank">Solution Paper #24</a>, The Roll Call Of Those  Calling for the Vikings to Move</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And references to outside proposed solutions submitted to the Vikings in 2000 and again in 2004:&nbsp; (<a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/summaryFM.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/generic.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/fourtrack.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/overallexsum.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/stadiumsituation.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/mnstadiumgames.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/politalk.html"><strong>here)</strong></a>. </p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <strong>KEY QUESTION</strong> from my 12-11-11<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/47SaveVikings.htm" target="_blank"> Solution Paper #47: Save the Vikings or do they move?</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t the elected (Govenors, Legislators, City Council) and/or their staffs or the Vikings ever asked for a &lsquo;how?&rsquo; conversation/demonstration when given documents regarding how to build a new stadium without raising new taxes (<a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/summaryFM.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/generic.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/fourtrack.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/overallexsum.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/stadiumsituation.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/mnstadiumgames.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/politalk.html"><strong>here)</strong></a>?&rdquo;&nbsp; That  &ldquo;no new taxes&rdquo; solution presented in 2000 and 2004, if followed, would have yielded another $1 billion for the Vikings since then, the amount of the proposed stadium today.</p>
