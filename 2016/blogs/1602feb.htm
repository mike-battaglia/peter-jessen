<p><strong>Shooter a police informant. <br>
    <br>
</strong>February 24, 2016<strong><br>
<br>
</strong>Tomorrow morning&rsquo;s edition of the Minneapolis Star Tribune will report that the current supect in the shooting of Police Officer Jordan Davis has been identified,&nbsp;through court documents, as a police informant working for the police as far back as the 1990s.&nbsp; This represents an interesting development as it pertains to the fact that earlier today in Minneapolis, &nbsp;Mr. Deal was charged with two counts of burglary and assault.&nbsp; The information that he is a police inmformant and was involved in a possible retaliation killing of a individual will set a very dynamic table in the city of Minneapois, especially if it turns out spawn reciprocal killings.&nbsp;<br>

<p><strong>LEON RANKIN<br>
  Died Sunday, February 15, 2016</strong></p>
<p>We are saddened to report the passing of long time civil rights activist, businessman, and good friend, Leon Rankin.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We had the privilege of serving with Leon Rankin and later Elmer Childress and the late Nellie Stone Johnson, and others on the Urban League Board of Directors.&nbsp; We all served together from 1974 &ndash; 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rankin was one of the most effective organizers within the labor movement in Minnesota for African Americans and others of color.</p>
<p>Leon Rankin was only 1 of 2 African American Certified Master Electricians in the State of Minnesota.&nbsp; He was respected and often called upon within the labor movement for his advice and recommendations when the Urban League was at the forefront of changing to a positive relationship between organized labor and the African American community.&nbsp; Mr. Rankin worked closely with Nellie Stone Johnson and long time labor leader and U.S. Commissioner of Veterans Affairs for the State of Minnesota, Elmer Childress.&nbsp; In fact, Mr. Childress became the first and only African American to serve as the Commissioner of Veterans Affairs in the history of Minnesota.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both Mr. Rankin, Ms. Nellie Stone Nelson, and Mr. Cecil Newman, founder and publisher of the <em>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</em>, worked together through the Urban League.</p>
<p>He will long be remembered as one of the most successful and effective civil rights leaders in the State of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Our condolences to his family and loved ones, both here and in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Services for Mr. Rankin will be held in the Twin Cities on Saturday, February 21, 2016.&nbsp;</p>
