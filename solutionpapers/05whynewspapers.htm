<p><strong>Rod Edwards On Why American Cities Need Black Newspapers</strong></p>
<p>Ed. note: A major theme of The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, is the bias 
  of White newspapers (in Minneapolis its the Star Tribune and in St. Paul its 
  The Pioneer Press) and the reality that if Blacks in America want the truth, 
  they also need to read their local Black newspapers, as well as so-called alternative 
  White papers. In Minneapolis this has meant the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com" target="_blank">Spokesman-Recorder</a>. 
</p>
<p>Another Black newspaper, <a href="http://www.insightnews.com" target="_blank">Insight</a> 
  covers both Minneapolis and twin city St. Paul. And major alternative papers 
  offering Blacks an unfettered voice are <a href="http://www.citypages.com" target="_blank">City 
  Pages</a>, and <a href="http://www.rakemag.com" target="_blank">The Rake</a>, 
  among others. </p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s point: unless citizens read the Black press and the alternative press, 
  they will not only not get the full truth, they will often get misleading information 
  and distortion of the truth. As if to proove this point, it has now been nearly 
  a month Despite the Star Tribune having a copy of The Minneapolis Story for 
  nearly a month that the book was given to The Star Tribune; it is known to at 
  least three major columnists, and probably more. And yet, despite the fact that 
  the book is the talk of the Black community in Minneapolis (both positive and 
  negative), meaning it is definnitely news, The Star Tribune has yet to acknowledge 
  the book, review the book, or comment on the book. For this reason, we have 
  decided to put Ron&#8217;s thinking on this in this one place as a way of fostering 
  and encouraging all citizens, Blck and White, that seek the truth, to not only 
  read but subscribe to their local Black papers and their local alternative press. 
  What follow are exerpts that are direct quotes from the book, in chronological 
  order as the appear in the book:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>About some of what I say you may ask: &#8220;If this is true, how come I haven&#8217;t 
    read about it in the newspaper?&#8221; That alone helps prove one of my points: 
    that what you have missed in the Minneapolis Star Tribune or in the St. Paul 
    Pioneer Press, the mouthpieces of the puppet-masters, has been written about 
    in the nn-Recorder, the Minneapolis Black newspaper. So read on. In Minneapolis, 
    as in many cities, it is the Black newspapers that carry the most truth (p. 
    3).</p>
  <p>My special audience for this book is the African-American readers of Minneapolis 
    and, in particular, the readers of the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, [and 
    Insight]the only independent [Black] news voices in Minneapolis (as it is 
    with Black newspapers in many cities). More than any others, Black newspapers 
    know the importance of not being &#8220;asleep at the switch&#8221; when it 
    comes to knowing what is going on. It is a matter of survival to always &#8220;know 
    what time it is&#8221; in terms of what is going on. This book is about what 
    time it is in Minneapolis (p. 4).</p>
  <p>The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder was the only media outlet to give the story 
    of the missing files major coverage (it even put a picture showing the wall 
    of empty file cabinets on its front page), but that is a Black newspaper, 
    so who will pay attention to that? And so nearly a year after the files disappeared 
    (stolen? hidden? shredded ?), neither the newly elected Mayor nor the City 
    Attorney nor any other public official, city or state, has honored the request 
    of Cherryhomes&#8217; successor, Natalie Johnson-Lee, to investigate the taking 
    of the missing files (p. 68).</p>
  <p>&#8230;it is my belief that the files purposely taken by Cherryhomes could 
    answer a lot of these questions. I believe they were either shredded like 
    Enron did or squirreled away for later use to keep track of who was promised 
    what and who owes whom what political favor. We won&#8217;t know until we see the 
    files. And so far, neither the mayor, city attorney, or local media seem to 
    care, as since November 2001, it has been only the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, 
    newly elected Council Member Natalie Johnson-Lee, and I who have called for 
    their return and for an investigation into their taking and their content 
    (p. 133). </p>
  <p>What is so telling is that not only were few amazed, but that most just sat 
    back, smiled, and watched. Only recently has anyone tried to do something 
    about it besides Natalie Johnson-Lee, the Spokesman-Recorder, and I (p. 138)</p>
  <p>This will not just go away. People are at the end of their rope. A major 
    forum was held in Minneapolis at the Sabathani Community Center on Saturday, 
    August 3, 2002. You can read the full story not, of course in the Star Tribune 
    or other White papers, but in the Black Spokesman-Recorder of the Thursday, 
    August 8-14, 2002 edition (153). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I have noted before, and as I will show you below, just because you don&#8217;t 
  read of this in the Minneapolis Star Tribune doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t being covered. 
  All of this gets reported, but not to any extent in the major papers. To get 
  all the news of your city, read or subscribe to the Black newspaper. In Minneapolis, 
  that newspaper is the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, whose article I include 
  below. Indeed, in any urban setting, if you want the truth in terms of front-page 
  news, read your Black newspaper. The other excellent alternative newspaper in 
  Minneapolis is City Pages. </p>
<p>And that independent, fearless alternative media, as in newspapers, in Minneapolis 
  are the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder and City Page (p. 193). The above was in 
  Response to these paragraphs in the Statesman-Recorder (pp. 192-3): This coverage 
  was, in plain and simple terms, a total Whitewash of the public hearing on city 
  ward boundaries with a proposed map that has occurred for 10 years, and that 
  will not occur again until the year 2012. Nor was it just the &#8220;Star Tribune&#8221;&#8212;to our knowledge, no major TV or radio stations covered the event. No better 
  argument is possible for a strong, independent, fearless alternative media in 
  this city to fill in the huge blanks.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now I know that by now, dear reader, you are wondering how can all this be? 
    How come, you ask, you haven&#8217;t read it in the press? If this is true, why 
    hasn&#8217;t it been in the newspapers and on TV? Good questions. But it has been. 
    And if, dear reader, you ask where, then I know you don&#8217;t read the Black newspaper, 
    The Minnesota Spokesman and Recorder, and I know that you don&#8217;t listen to 
    the Black news on radio station KMOJ, nor, for that matter, my TV program. 
    For several years we have all carried the story. In fairness, the White papers 
    have carried it as a joke or in snippets, but not enough to upset anyone, 
    for they know the Vikings are not to be saved. And they know Whites are not 
    reading the Black newspaper, so they have nothing to fear (p. 256). </p>
  <p>Fitzgerald concluded by predicting that the Vikings will move to Los Angeles, 
    the Twins will stay in a renovated dome, and the Gopher football team will 
    get its own stadium on its campus. Has anything changed since last summer? 
    Here is Fitzgerald again, in August 2002, not only answering this question 
    but also pointing out the unheralded but necessary reading of the Black independent 
    newspapers in this country: (p. 256)</p>
  <p>First let us look at what the two major newspapers said about the Council 
    decision, then let&#8217;s discuss what actually took place. The Minneapolis Star 
    Tribune downplayed the walk-out and its significance. I must admit that the 
    St. Paul Pioneer Dispatch was more accurate in its reporting. The most accurate 
    reports you&#8217;ll get is from the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder and from The City 
    Pages, when they write their stories. But I can assure you that their stories 
    will be far more detailed and accurate than either of the White papers (p. 
    287).</p>
  <p>The fans&#8217; rage will be even greater at the reality of how these wealthy owners 
    went along with the use of outside money to ship out the people&#8217;s Vikings, 
    as reported in USA Today (August 6, 2002): the NFL gave or loaned Red McCombs 
    $100 million to help him buy the team to ensure that it would be shipped out. 
    No one knew this before. This was the first time this news leaked out, meaning 
    it had been a secret for five years. Note: you did not read this in the Star 
    Tribune. But it was in USA Today, and it was featured in Larry Fitzgerald&#8217;s 
    column in the Spokesman Recorder (p. 258).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, you won&#8217;t find the news in the establishment papers, but do check 
  the Spokesman-Recorder and City Pages. I was at the meetings. These papers were 
  represented and they said they would be providing full coverage (p. 270) [and 
  later did]. </p>
