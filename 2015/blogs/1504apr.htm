<p><strong>Sad collapse of Minneapolis Urban League  by corrupt Black leadership was steady over time, ever since 1990.</strong><br>
  <br>
April 16, 2015.</p>
<p>Breaking news April 15, 2015:  Star Tribune began updating its report in the evening (see Star Tribune, 4-16-15,<a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/300014471.html">Legislative auditor to investigate Minneapolis Urban League</a>, and Star Tribune, April 13, 2015, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/299517811.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y#continue" target="_blank">Minneapolis Urban League accused of potential double billing</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This continues our reporting on the coming end of  the Minnesota Urban League (MUL). <strong>For the first time, there will essentially be two enclaves, St. Paul and Minneappoalis  without an UL  affiliate</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  See our column of April 16, 2015, <strong>Crises in Black leadership 
    Changes in the Urban League and the NAACP</strong> and see our <strong>blog entries of April 1 and 6, 2015. </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>The last &ldquo;State of the Urban League&rdquo; address was given by me in 1989</strong>.  All was gone in 1990, with the promise of modern things that turned into both the NAACP and  MUL to become no longer functional or  influential entities in the Twin Cities. <strong>Prior to this,  through the 1980s, both were</strong> <strong>among the most important organizations iin the black community, nation wide.</strong> Now they are nothing. </p>
<p><strong>Their demise across America reflects the quality of sincerity of liberal America.</strong> The behavior of the leaders of these two organizations could result in no new tax payer dollars for these organizations for the next 10-20 years.  Any new organiation that is formed will have to be formed by individuals that are squeaky clean.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The  new favorites of liberals, reflecting the search by liberals of calm plantations to run, are the Hispanics and Asians, especially Spanish Latino and Asian immigrants. </strong>The Somalis haven&rsquo;t slid into a position of influence due to being Muslim.  Thus it has happened to the once most powerful black organiations in the history of Minnesota. </p>
<p> But the negative value of these organizations is seen in how <strong>their leadership did nothing but increase, not decrease, the poverty and lack of development in Black inner cities. <br>
  </strong><br>
  <strong>More history of the demise</strong> of Black leadership and organizations can be found in <strong>Chapter 14 of our 2002 book</strong>, The Minneapolis Story, with the title <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/37Chap14.htm" target="_blank">The Role of Minneapolis BLACK ORGANIZATIONS in the Minneapolis Story: Civil Rights Commission, Urban League, NAACP, Churches/Synagogues/Mosques</a>.  The <strong>subtitle clarifies, reporting the these Black organiations are</strong> <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/37Chap14.htm" target="_blank">Being Part of the Problem Rather than the Solution, as they Move Toward White-Like Black-Elite Rule, for Spoils Not Principles and Sell Out Inner city Black Community Interests: Education, Housing, and Jobs, Dignity and Recognition.</a></p>
<p>Former Mayor R.T. <strong>Rybak</strong>, who came in office in <strong>2002</strong>, <strong>declared</strong> he was going to see that <strong>new Black leaders</strong> were chosen who would cooperate with him. <strong>We  now see the result of his plan.<br>

<p><strong>LEADERSHIP COLLAPSE:&nbsp; causing coming change in NAACP and Urban League leadership.</strong> <strong>More of the same or true change for the benefit of our African American community?</strong></p>
<p>April 6, 2015<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.&nbsp; NAACP MINNEAPOLIS BRANCH: &nbsp;UNPRECEDENTED SPECIAL ELECTION.</strong><br>
  For the first time in 16 months, an unprecedented 2nd election ordered by the National NAACP, will be held on May 2, 2015. 320124g made that.<br>
  <br>
  One of the concerns is that Louis King, who some continue to  identify as a significang and effecive black leader in the Twin Cities, has been a member of the Executive Committee of the local NAACP branch as it disintegrated, leading to the action by the national NAACP to hold this special election, May 2nd set with a 30 day notice.<br>
  <br>
  Todate there has been no comment from Mr. King on the collapse of the Minneapolis NAACP.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;MINNEAPOLIS URBAN LEAGUE  (MUL) AFFILIATE&rsquo;S LEADER&rsquo;S RESIGNATION.</strong><br>
  Scott Gray tended his resignation effective immediately according to Insight News, whose publisher is President of the Minneapolis Urban League Board.</p>
<p><strong>3. WILL WE GET NEW FACES AND STABILITY OR JUST  NEW FACES WHO CONTINUE THE INSTABILITY?</strong><br>
  This information about our local NAACP branch and our local Urban League affiliate comes at a very difficult time for the African American community and the attempt by some to push the perception of stability when, in reality, there has long been instability.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  The collapse of the African American leadership of these organizations continue to negatively effect and impact our community.</p>

<p><strong>The Continued Decline of Leadership in Twin Cities</strong>.<br>
  <strong>Leadership abandonment again. at the NAACP and the Urban League.</strong></p>
<p>April 1, 2015</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottgray88" target="_blank">Scott Gray</a>,</strong> President of the <a href="http://www.mul.org" target="_blank">Minneapolis Urban League</a>, has resigned to take a position with a CAP agency outside the Twin Cities. As an owner of a Subway franchise and Dairy Queen Franchise in Madison, WI, he should know something about leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why doens't he exercise those skills now  for the community instead of postponing doing so by leaving the Twin Cities<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Minneapolis.Urban.League" target="_blank"> to pursue yet more studies,</a> this time under a Bush Fellowhip, as  he seeks to  pursue post-graduate work &ldquo;to get a Ph.D. in nonprofit leadership&rdquo; so he can create a &ldquo;social enterprise and innovation institute that inspires, teaches, and develops best-practice models for nonprofits.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Don't we already have organizations to do this?  Once again, &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; gravitates away from what is needed now &ndash; education, jobs, housing &ndash; and drags more talent away to organizations providing jobs for non-profit administrators but none for the neighbors of our communities in terms of education, jobs, and affordable housing.&nbsp; Case in point:&nbsp; no leadership resulting in prime employment in the billions of construction currently being undertaken in downtown Minneapolis, including the Vikings stadium.</p>
<p>According to The Minneapolis Urban League (MUL)<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Minneapolis.Urban.League" target="_blank"> faceook</a></strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Minneapolis.Urban.League"> page</a>, MUL &ldquo;provides direct service for nearly 4,000 people, and 20,000 more look to us for public advocacy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Don't  we need less in meetings of advocates and more of action from &quot;doers.&quot; &nbsp; Advocacy needs plans and collaboration with the private and public sectors to achieve success in education, jobs, public safety and affordable housing.&nbsp; We see much advocacy for ideas but not for the plans and actions needed to implement the MUL goal to help members &ldquo;prepare and prosper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why so little influence in facilitating hiring for the Vikings stadium construction and for the rest of the billions in construction in downtown Minneapolis?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry McAfee</strong>, Minneapolis NAACP President, has let his membership lapse in the NAACP.<br>
  Where is McAfee&rsquo;s attention?&nbsp; Certainly not the NAACP.<br>
  <br>
  Where is McAfee&rsquo;s loyalty:&nbsp; to the NAACP or to being Pastor of New Salem Baptist Church?<br>
  The Bible says we cannot serve two masters. <br>
  Who will step up to end the aimlessness of the Minneapolis Branch of the NAACP, or will the National NAACP have to follow through on its considering putting the branch under receivership?</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
