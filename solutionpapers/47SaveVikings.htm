<p><strong>SOLUTION PAPER #47: SAVE THE VIKINGS! OR DO THEY MOVE? </strong> <strong>Lists columns on the leave or stay question since 2005</strong><strong>: TEN COLUMNS ARE LISTED</strong> that we have written since 2005, after the Minneapolis Story book's Chapter 15 in 2002, which declares &quot;Save the Vikings&quot; and offers solutions for doing so. As no one has listened nor asked questions about these solutions, it will be no mystery or surprize when they move.  The book &quot;Stadium Games&quot; says the same, saying it is the consensus among the corporate and political elite that the Vikings have to move.<br>
</p>
<p> <strong>Column of November 09, 2011, plan to <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2011/columns/11q4.htm#1145c1109" target="_blank">&quot;Save the Vikings: Stop the punting of the Vikings! <br>
  Minnesotans: Unite with a &lsquo;Fan Response Movement&rsquo; to keep the team.</a></strong>  <br>
  Here are 
all the talking points needed regarding why the Vikes are doommed to move unless certain step are taken, including  an Internet Viral Campaign for the purpose of keeping the team from moving by enabling the solving  the &quot;how to finance a new stadium&quot; question.  Answer: become a part of the &quot;Save the Vikings Movement&quot;. Tell five people about this column and have them tell five and have them tell five, etc. Tell them to read it and then, IF THEY WANT TO SAVE THE VIKINGS, join the movement to contact the governor, legislators, mayor, the Vikings, Star Tribune, WCCO, etc. and tell them to hold a family meeting, resolve this, and keep the Vikings.</p>

<p><strong>THESE GROUPS ARE OPPOSED TO THE VIKINGS STAYING:</strong><br>
  1. University elitists who want the University first in the hearts of football fans, and are jealous of the Vikings being in town, taking away the University&rsquo;s thunder?</p>
<p>2. Corporations that don&rsquo;t want to spend money on suites for four teams, so bye bye Vikings?</p>
<p>3. Any of the 37 &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; on the 2005  <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm" target="_blank"><strong>The Roll Cal</strong></a>l of those who say the Vikings, have to go?</p>
<p>4.Key Minnesota leaders' <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/38Chap15.htm" target="_blank">The Plan</a>: have the Vikings leave town, 2002.</p>
<p>5. Stadium and arena promises were broken to Bob Short, Norm Green, and Red McCombs.  The Wilfs are next.</p>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTION:</strong> why haven&rsquo;t the electeds or their staffs or the Vikings ever asked &ldquo;how?&rdquo; when shown how to build a new stadium without raising new taxes (<a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/summaryFM.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/generic.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/fourtrack.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/mn.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/overallexsum.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/stadiumsituation.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/mnstadiumgames.html">here</a> and <a href="https://peterjessen-gpa.com/pages/politalk.html">here)</a>?</p>
