    <p><strong><a name="0850c1231" id="0801c37"></a>December 31, 2008 Column #50: A most  historic year for our nation. And a busy year for local discrimination as well.</strong></p>
    <p>The economy is in a worldwide transition. Significant wars are visiting  terror on both a global and local basis in the Middle East, Far East and Africa.  And yet the number-one story today is, and will be when historians look back  decades from now, the election and presidency of Barack Obama. There is no other  story even close to that for the number-one story of the year. </p>
    <p>Not even bookies in Las Vegas would have given odds on an Obama victory.  Many, worn down by history's failed attempts, felt that it couldn't possibly  happen. But through the creation of a well-designed campaign strategy,  tremendous loyalty, legions of volunteers, and an excitement not seen in some  time for a first-voter generation, Barack Obama did overcome. </p>
    <p>Many thought he would misstep, that he would not get out of the primaries or  the caucuses, that he would not be able to overcome the popular frontrunner,  Senator Hilary Clinton of New York. And if he did accomplish these things, the  thought of many was that America was still &quot;not ready&quot; to embrace the dream and  elect the man.</p>
    <p>But, my friends, the impossible dream became a reality at a crucial time in  the history of our republic. He has brought a very much needed uplifting, a  renewed vigor, a brighter vision of the future, and a call for America's sons  and daughters to close ranks and set aside the differences that too frequently  drive them apart. </p>
    <p>The challenges he faces are enormous. There is no betting against him now. He  has rekindled the American dream in many who didn't think they could continue to  dream it. Every American has been freed to dream their version of the American  Dream. Just like Dorothy passing over the rainbow to Oz, the election was a  magical moment. [Also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0843c1112">here</a>.] </p>
    <p>Barack Obama laid the foundation. Barack Obama has stayed the course. On his  website, <a href="http://www.change.gov" target="_blank">Change.gov</a>, he  has opened a new section, <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/seat_at_the_table/" target="_blank">YOUR SEAT at THE  TABLE</a>, and asks us to submit ideas. We have submitted our Solution  Paper #33 regarding the seats at the table, as well as our new book, <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/" target="_blank">A Seat for Everyone</a>. I urge my readers to go to his Change.gov website and submit  their ideas as well. </p>
    <p>To look forward to 2009 and beyond, contemplating the future of our nation  and the future of our children, we pause briefly to look back to see how 2008 is  preparing us for 2009. We humbly acknowledge and appreciate being recognized for  our efforts earlier in December at the <a href="http://twincitiesmediaalliance.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/save-the-date-community-ethnic-media-celebration-125/" target="_blank">Minnesota  Community and Ethnic Media Awards ceremony </a>of the Twin Cities Media  Alliance and its local news website, Twin Cities Daily Planet. [Read our <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/blogs/0812dec.htm">acceptance remarks</a>.]</p>
    <p>Perhaps the biggest story in our Minneapolis community in 2008 has been the  historic lawsuit of &quot;The Mill City Five,&quot; five Black police officers <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2007/blogs/0712dec.htm">suing the City  for discrimination </a>in four major areas, and the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/31minncops.htm">ensuing  battle between them and the City </a>as &quot;The Five&quot; have dared to attack  the wall of <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0815c0430">nullification  and reversal</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp; [Also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0823c0625">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#0827c0723">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#0828c0730">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#0829c0806">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0840c1022">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0841c1029">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0842c1105">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0845c1126">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0849c1224">here</a>.] </p>
    <p>How this is handled will have long-reaching ramifications in governance and  race relations as the discrimination deniers face off against the targets of  their discrimination. The situation has gotten so far out of hand that we had <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0805c0206">another  historic first</a>: the mostly-White Police Federation's first-ever  lawsuit against the City on behalf of a Black officer, one of the &quot;Mill City  Five.</p>
    <p>We also <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0804c0130">defended  a White officer </a>the department went after who stood up for Black  officers, not to mention the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0818c0521">Federation's  historic request </a>for a criminal investigation of MPD Chief Dolan.  We wrote about the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0848c1217">continued  bad treatment of Black men </a>and about the Civil Rights <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0817c0514">Department</a>, the Civil Rights Commission , and the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#0832c0827">DFL </a>failing to stand up for civil rights [also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionspapers13emergency.htm">here </a>regarding the DFL]. </p>
    <p>We spoke up when <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/30stribsilence.htm">traditional  media </a>[also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#0831c0820">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0838c1008">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0849c1224">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0813c0409">here </a>re the Star Tribune] and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q3.htm#08309c0813">minority  &quot;spokesperson&quot; organizations failed </a>to do so, practicing &quot;the art  of silence,&quot; also known as &quot;acts of cowardice&quot; [also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0802c0115">here</a>]. 2009 will shine the final light on these cases.</p>
    <p>In January, we asked <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0803c0123">who  will challenge discrimination in this city </a>[see also <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0808c0227">here </a>and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0844c1119">here</a>]. We presented numerous examples, including the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0820c0604">denial  of jobs </a>to Blacks on major construction sites such as the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q1.htm#0809c0305">Twins  and Gophers stadiums </a>[see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/blogs/0807jul.htm">list of six  past columns </a>from 2005, 06, 07], as well as discrimination in  education (e.g., <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0821c0611">North  High School</a>; also see <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q4.htm#0847c1210">here</a>). </p>
    <p>In closing, for the purposes of the local scene, we know that a Cecil Newman,  a Nellie Stone Johnson, and others offer a smile and a wink for a job well done. May there be a happy New Year and peace in our time.</p>
