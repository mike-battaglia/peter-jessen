<p>January 2, 3016</p>
<p>Local NAACP breaks national NAACP and Federal non-profit rules <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-naacp-objects-to-restraint-of-14-year-old-girl-at-mall-of-america/363948541/" target="_blank">by calling for a boycott of the Mall of America</a>.  Why are they risking losing their 501(c)3 status?  Don&rsquo;t they know?  Don&rsquo;t they care?  Or do they believe they are above the national NAACP and federal rules and laws? </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they know they don&rsquo;t have the legal right, under NAACP and federal rules, to call for a boycott? Why are they jeopardizing the entire NAACP by calling for a boycott of MOA, an illegal action?.  Look forward to our historical analysis of how calling for a boycott is a dangerious game that can cripple a national movement.</p>
