<p><strong>Patrol Officer Michael Griffin, Minneapolis police officer, indicted on nine criminal counts over bar fights, including perjury.</strong></p>
<p>May 21, 2015</p>
<p>Three views: <br>
  <strong>1.  Griffin's  attorney:</strong> Griffin has &quot;not broken the law.... innocent of all charges ...  false accusations ... will be found not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2. Ron Edwards:</strong> &ldquo; 'I do hope that we are not looking at a double standard by federal authorities because there have been a number of cases involving white officers over the last five years where federal authorities appeared to show no interest,' said civil rights activist Ron Edwards, a former president of the Minneapolis Urban League, who sits on a police oversight committee appointed by Police Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Edwards </strong>expressed regret at the turn of events for Griffin, who became an officer in 2007: '&ldquo;It is so hard and difficult to get a person of color, African-Americans, into law enforcement in this state,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This was a young man who came into the department with high expectations. Something went wrong. He lost his vision of what he wanted to do.' &rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>U.S. Attorney Andy Luger: </strong>&ldquo;The race of an officer or victim is not and never will be a factor in my office&rsquo;s charging decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hope so. We seek fairness and justice.  We'll be watching. </p>
<p><strong>[Editor's note: </strong>Edwards has been called<strong> &quot;the last man standing&quot; </strong>supporting  a Martin Luther King style non-violent civil rights movemement. </p>
