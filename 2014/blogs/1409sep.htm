                <p><strong>August, 13, 2014: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2014/columns/14q3.htm#c1433d0813">Stadium Update. Is 34% minority participation goal being met?</a>?</strong><br>

The article clearly suggests they aren&rsquo;t qualified for stadium construction work.  How many Summit graduates are?&quot;<br>

Its time of stalling by again saying &ldquo;wait&rdquo; has run out (see Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s seminal 1963 book regarding this, Why We Can&rsquo;t Wait.  Hint: injustice and unfairness).<br>
                  <br>
                  In his 1963, &ldquo;Letter from a Birmingham jail,&rdquo; Dr. King wrote: &quot;The question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or the extension of justice?&quot;<br>

  <strong>October 17, 2012 Column #42: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2012/columns/12q4.htm#c1242d1017">Vikings stadium officials promise 32 percent diversity hiring! But no one seems to have a copy of the equity plan</a>.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Column, May 12, 2010, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2010/columns/10q2.htm#1019c0512">City failed to monitor hiring during Twins stadium construction</a></strong>.  I &ldquo;vigorously opposed the breaking of employment compliance law&rdquo; by the Twins Ball Park Authority. &hellip;.  there was fanatical resistance, absolute refusal, to embrace a specific goal for African Americans.</p>
                <p>Column, February 20, 2012, Will Blacks finally get a fair share of work on this stadium?  Chair of stadium authority raises serious questions about past inclusion.  Three City-commissioned studies by two separate research groups support Chairwoman Kelm-Helgen&rsquo;s observations. The last study was issued on May 15, 2012, by NERA (National Economic Research Associates) at a cost to Minneapolis of $500,000. These studies expose the City&rsquo;s serious and purposeful noncompliance with Minority and Women Business Enterprises (M/WBE) utilization requirements.</p>
                <p>Ted Mondale, who stated to us at a closed meeting October 10, 2012, with the chairwoman that although there was no Equity Plan for Target Field, and that they had no numbers for compliance, it will be different for the Vikings stadium; just give us a chance, Ted Mondale said. NERA&rsquo;s report will help facilitate preventing future cover-ups and provides an opportunity to stop the misrepresentation of the plight of African Americans in Minneapolis.</p>
                <p>Pages 205-208 show just how little inclusion there has been for African Americans in the area of utilization in construction and other aspects of economic opportunity: less than one percent. At page 209 of the October 22, 2010 report we see that on City-funded construction projects for the period 2003-2007, African Americans were awarded and ultimately paid less than one percent of the total.</p>
                <p>Zero in so many categories &mdash; this exposes the true nature of so-called Minneapolis job training programs. Only the size of this new stadium project is exposing the true nature of the Minneapolis condition of purposefully not training African American workers and of hiring minorities defined as not Black.

Claims of certification and hires are false. Despite computers able to collect data, unlike the old paper-and-pencil days, the City cannot authenticate African American hiring for the construction at TCF Stadium, Target Field, Target Center, Fairview Children&rsquo;s Hospital at the University of MN, or the Minneapolis Public Schools District&rsquo;s new HQ.</p>
