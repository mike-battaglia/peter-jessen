<p><strong><a name="0575b1109"></a>November 9, 2005, Blog #75: Report of the Compliance and Review Committee (CRC) of the Police Community Relations Council (PCRC) Before the Safety Committee of the City of Minneapolis</strong></p>
<p>Thurgood Marshall, first Black Justice of the Supreme Court, is famous for 
  many statements.  A favorite it this:  &quot;Lawlessness is lawlessness. Anarchy is anarchy is anarchy. Neither race 
  nor color nor frustration is an excuse for either lawlessness or anarchy.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the perception of lawlessness and anarchy on both community and police 
  sides that led to the nine month series of meetings mediated by the federal 
  Department of Justice, that resulted in the forming, in December of 2003, of 
  the <strong>P</strong>olice <strong>C</strong>ommunity <strong>R</strong>elations 
  <strong>C</strong>ouncil (PCRC), resulting in the signing of The Agreement between 
  the City of Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Police Department, and the community 
  unity team.  </p>
<p>There were 82 points agreed to.  The day of the forming of the PCRC was 
  a high mark in the quest for justice in a land of laws.  But the City 
  of Minneapolis is not in compliance, as it is not in other areas.  My 
  report today will cover just a small portion of this:  the failure of 
  the city to comply with agreed upon hiring practices in the matter of new hires 
  for the Minneapolis Police Department. </p>
<p>This should be a joint report.  It is not, because the City of Minneapolis 
  has, is, and will continue to sabotage the PCRC, which will eventually bring 
  the Department of Justice to battle for justice again because the City, its 
  Mayor, and its City Council have already made the political calculation of &#8220;so 
  what&#8221; when it comes to compliance issues and communities of color.  </p>
<p>As duly noted above and widely known within these chambers, the City of Minneapolis 
  has a shameful history, in terms of people of color, of ignoring the law and 
  of not being in compliance with both federal and local laws.  This Report 
  provides our examination on key points of the city&#8217;s non-compliance, with special 
  emphasis on the process of hiring members of protected classes, especially people 
  of color, for positions on the police force. </p>
<p>Please receive this report as part of an ongoing examination of the compliance 
  with The Agreement of December 2003.  It is important to restate that 
  The Agreement between the City of Minneapolis, its police department, and the 
  unity community team, was negotiated by the Department of Justice, in the document 
  identified as Memorandum of Agreement. </p>
<p>It will not be necessary to take a long time to report on how the agreement 
  has been violated.  </p>
<p>The genesis for that statement is contained in a packet of Emails provided 
  by the Minneapolis Police Department on Thursday, October 20, 2005, at approximately 
  2:22 p.m.  The emails were from Deputy Chief Lucy Gerold to a host of 
  individuals.  These emails support the concerns expressed by community 
  members as early as February 2004. </p>
<p>We call your attention to the minutes of the PCRC meeting of March 31, 2004. 
   </p>
<p>As early as March 2004, we recognized that there were ongoing problems on the 
  city side regarding the implementation of the document referred to as &#8220;The Agreement.&#8221; 
   But it was a year later, in the spring of 2005, that we saw the disastrous 
  results of non-compliance beginning the destruction of the mediation agreement. 
   As elected politicians discussed law and order, crime fighting tactics, 
  and pubic safety, it become quite clear to communities of color that there were 
  no plans whatsoever to guarantee even minimal inclusion of protected class members, 
  specifically people of color, in the compliance areas of The Agreement.  
</p>
<p>In the meeting of August 22, 2005, it became clear that there was no commitment 
  whatsoever (Parks sat down to stand up) to an action of diversity in the recruitment 
  and hiring of police officers.  </p>
<p>Surely the City of Minneapolis needs its own Rosa Parks, or a Joe Parks, to 
  stand up for diversity hiring by sitting down and not moving to the back of 
  the compliance bus. </p>
<p>In July of 2005, Mr. Champa had warned that the recruitment and hiring process 
  as it related to people of color and the Police Department, was going to be 
  a disaster and a failure.  In fact, in early September 2005, I personally 
  appeared before this committee and asked for your help in acquiring the Champa 
  report and any other information that was in Mr. Champa&#8217;s and the City of Minneapolis 
  possession.  I returned a month later, joined by other colleagues, indicating 
  that the information had not been forthcoming, and renewed my request on behalf 
  of the committee, and on behalf of The Agreement.  And once again, nothing 
  was forthcoming. </p>
<p>We also appeared before Civil Service Committee.  We appealed before 
  the office of the Mayor of the City of Minneapolis directly, through the office 
  of Deputy Mayor David Fey. </p>
<p>In mid-September 2005, in a meeting at Harrison Middle School,  we again 
  asked Deputy Mayor David A. Fey for a copy of the report of Mr. Champa.  
</p>
<p>This is why we quoted Justice Thurgood Marshall: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Lawlessness is lawlessness. Anarchy is anarchy is anarchy. Neither race 
      nor color nor frustration is an excuse for either lawlessness or anarchy. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I trust that the irony is not lost on this august assembly that the lawlessness 
  in question deals with the City itself and its police department. </p>
<p>We take note that the Minneapolis Police department was served notice by us 
  on June 15, 2005, that there was non-compliance on 25 action items that were 
  part of The Agreement.  The City of Minneapolis is facing two civil rights 
  complaints filed in the past ten days, wih more civil rights complaints on the 
  way.  See attached minutes, June 15, 2005. </p>
<p>Examples of specific areas of concern regarding non-compliance are the following 
  areas lacking compliance: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Community partnerships </li>
  <li>Assistance of PCRC in developing a police recruitment strategy </li>
  <li>The existence of a focus group regarding such hires </li>
  <li>Review of strategy with PCRC in the MPD&#8217;s recruitment strategy </li>
  <li>Diversifying the pool of candidates for initial hires. </li>
  <li>Also our concern with a final review of the overall hiring process </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the 25 violations.  Of course we now understand 
  why there was no response to our requests for information:  it was because 
  there was never any intention to diversify the Minneapolis Police Department. 
   </p>
<p>Recall the adage that the proof is in the pudding.  The flavor of the 
  pudding for new hires for the police department is decidedly vanilla.  
  Not that it needs to be chocolate.  But we were expecting a swirl of both. 
   That would have reflected compliance. </p>
<p>This took place on the watch of this Council, this Mayor, this Police Department. 
   Such non-compliance must be encouraged, and this council and mayor did 
  the encouraging. </p>
<p>It is quite clear, that, according to the Emails of September 2nd , 2005, that 
  even though chief William McManus gave a direct order NOT to go ahead with an 
  all white list, NOT to make any offers to mostly whites, NOT to sign off on 
  the list that didn&#8217;t comply with The Agreement, that he was overridden, countermanded, 
  and reversed by the office of the Mayor. </p>
<p>Just a week ago, in the meeting of the hiring committee, at the 5th Precinct, 
  we were told that the Mayor, acting on the powers invested in him by the City 
  Charter, countermanded the orders of Chief William McManus and circumvented 
  the concerns of a commitment to diversity.  It was, for members of the 
  Public Safety Committee, business as usual.  The concern was to get more 
  white police officers on the street.  Once again, diversity would have 
  to wait; again, as it is always pushed out, hence the plaintive cry of a Met&#8217;s 
  fan, &#8220;there is always next year.&#8221;  The difference is that the Mets 
  always had a theoretical chance and did eventually win the World Series. Not 
  so in Minneapolis for people of color:  there is not even a theoretical 
  chance of compliance of hiring practices as the anarchy of the City and its 
  departments continues to drive the dynamic of hiring people of color. </p>
<p>This represents business as usual.  Their future of inclusion of all 
  communities in the police department is not important to this Mayor and to this 
  Council.  In other words, &#8220;to hell with The Agreement.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In closing, our assessment is this, in the famous phrase of Apollo 13:  
  Minneapolis, we have a problem.  And the inability of Minneapolis to deal 
  with this very central problem has done irreparable harm and damage to the communities 
  of color and to their opportunity for full inclusion in law enforcement in this 
  city.  Be advised that it is our intention to see that this report is 
  delivered as soon as possible to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, as we will 
  seek to have the Minneapolis Police Department be examined regarding its compliance 
  with the law and the Agreement.  The purpose of our petition to Department 
  of Justice will be to initiate the necessary steps to place this department 
  under Federal Receivership.  </p>
