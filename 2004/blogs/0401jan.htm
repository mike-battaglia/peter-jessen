  January 19, 2004 is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. We take this opportunity to 
  remind you of Interlude 4 of <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, </i> 
  by Ron Edwards, on 7 Great Americans, including Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
  of Ron Edwards&#8217; August 25, 2003, tribute to Dr. King, <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm"> 
  The Unfinished Dream </a>in the Solution Papers Section of this web site. 
  For this day and February as Black History Month, we also recommend the web 
  site devoted to Dr. King, <a href=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/ target="_blank"> 
  The Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project at Stanford University </a> 
  entitled “Social Justice, Transformation, and Reconciliation.” <br>

    <strong>(2) “Freedom and Justice” Award” Statement for Presentation of Plaque </strong> 
  </CENTER>

    <strong>at Tribute Dinner Honoring the Work of Ron Edwards</strong> 
  </CENTER>
  <CENTER>
    Urban League, Minneapolis, MN, January 8, 2004 
  </CENTER>
<p>On January 8, 2004, Minneapolis gathered to pay tribute to a carrier of Dr 
  King’s dream to Minneapolis and the world, at a banquet held to honor the work 
  for inner city Minneapolis. Ron’s publisher, Beacon on the Hill Press, sent 
  this statement read at the tribute dinner: 
<p>It is an honor to be invited to add to the recognition earned by Ron Edwards 
  in his forty years of work as a community activist and mediator in Minneapolis. 
  Ron calls all of us to work for the prize of freedom: equal access and equal 
  opportunity for all. 
<p>In a word, Ron’s book is about the <strong>gaps</strong> that still exist between Blacks 
  and Whites in education, jobs, housing, and public safety, why they happened 
  and how to close them. Ron lists in his book specific “how’s” for closing these 
  gaps now, if the community elects to do so now instead of waiting another 60 
  years. Legislators, council members and voters are the closest to public policy 
  making and the ones best able to reverse bad policy instituted by their predecessors. 
  However, each time legislators, council members or voters do not do so, they 
  too become part of the reasons for the gaps. That is not a “blame” statement. 
  It is a legacy statement. What legacy do the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota 
  want to be known for? 
<p>Ron’s thesis is a simple one: Minneapolis will either continue its great experiment 
  on how to show America how to keep inner city Blacks in their place, a form 
  of so-called benign apartheid, or it will change from discrimination and separation 
  to integration and inclusion: equal access and equal opportunity for all. Hope, 
  jobs, and housing begin with a good education. The Minneapolis mission of clubbing 
  the baby seals has been successful: young men descended from the slaves brought 
  to America from Africa have, in the inner city, been knocked off their feet, 
  crippled before they start by being denied the education provided to Whites. 
<p>Another concern is the failure to use the Golden Rule as Ron urges us in his 
  book and as Archbishop Flynn urged in his pastoral letter on racism in November. 
  Clearly the failure of both sides to follow the Golden Rule stands in the way 
  of problem resolution. 
<p>Despite the fact that not one person has come forward to repudiate or dispute 
  one thing written in the book, the book lies silent, causing fear in some, animosity 
  in others, especially in those advocates of the status quo, whether Black or 
  White. And so the community is split on how to deal with Ron’s account of and 
  suggestions for fighting for freedom and justice. 
<p>On one side of the Minneapolis divide, open to discussing the book and its 
  ideas, are City Pages, the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, both of which have 
  reviewed the book and given it front page coverage, and the Urban League. On 
  the other side of the Minneapolis divide that refuses to discuss the book and 
  its ideas, are the Star Tribune, Insight Newspaper, and the NAACP. 
<p>To close this divide Ron suggests, in another web site Solution Paper, that 
  Minneapolis use the <strong>ubuntu reconciliation</strong> approach of South African Archbishop 
  Desmond Tutu, a man who fought apartheid in South Africa and a man Ron had gotten 
  to agree to come to Minneapolis in the 1980s, only to have him prevented from 
  doing so by the University of Minnesota because the university disagreed with 
  the Tutu position that holders of stock in companies participating in apartheid 
  in South Africa divest themselves of that stock. Just as Archbishop Tutu called 
  upon both White Afrikaners and Blacks in South Africa to be <strong>reconcilers, 
  </strong> so too does Ron Edwards call the people of Minneapolis to be reconcilers. 
  As Archbishop Tutu said, “we are called to the business of forgiveness and reconciliation. 
  God is not saying ‘Do you like it or don’t you like it?’ We are called to do 
  it.” Ron has listed a series of conflict resolution models on his web site that 
  will help address how to approach and mediate disagreements and foster reconciliation. 
<p>The recently completed mediation between the community and police has been 
  a great step forward. Now, Minneapolis needs such mediation in the areas of 
  education, jobs and housing. One way to begin this is to follow the suggestion 
  in Ron’s book of establishing a Minneapolis Sullivan Commission. 
<p>The book has been expanded upon on the Minneapolis Story web site, especially 
  in two of the Solution Papers, one called <strong> “The Seven Solutions” </strong> paper, 
  the other <strong>The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together. 
  </strong> They follow Martin Luther King’s statement of “Why We Can’t Wait.” The 
  web site has also continued the story by posting daily entrees and weekly 
  columns. For 2004, Ron will post a new column or short essay each week. 
<p>May all of us be inspired by the work and effort of Ron Edwards, and may we, 
  as we begin the new year, resolve to make the Minneapolis Story and its continuation 
  a positive one, of hope, of optimism, and of positive action to enable closing 
  the gaps in education, jobs, housing, and public safety, now, not later, and 
  in doing so, evaluate and consider the solutions Ron suggests in his book and 
  on his web site. 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ron, please stand. </p>
  <p>Ron Edwards, it is with great personal and professional pride and pleasure 
    that we present to you this Freedom and Justice Award. The plaque reads as 
    follows:<br>
    <br>
    <CENTER>
      <strong>Freedom and Justice Award Presented to</strong> 
    </CENTER>
    <CENTER>
      <strong>RON EDWARDS</strong> 
    </CENTER>
  </p>
  <p> In recognition of the four decades of contributions as a community activist 
    and mediator in the civil rights struggle on behalf of justice for the people 
    of Minneapolis, especially those of the inner city. Serving as a positive 
    beacon of light and hope, seeking freedom and justice for all, he advocates 
    equal access and equal opportunity to close the attainment and achievement 
    gaps in education, jobs, housing, and public safety, which he documents in 
    his <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</i> (2002), <i>The Story of 
    America’s Inner Cities as Told By Example of Minneapolis, Mn</i> (2003), and 
    the www.TheMinneapolisStory.com web site. </p>
  <p>The plaque then quotes Ron from page 294 of his book: <br>

      <strong><i>“I am bullish on Minneapolis. <br>
      I keep my eye on the prize of freedom. <br>
      I believe it can be a city on the hill for all people.”</i></strong> <br>

<p><strong>Blog #1. 1-1-04: New Year’s Resolution for 2004: End the gaps caused by 
  racism, injustice and dream deferral (whether by Whites or Blacks)</strong> 
<p>The Rev. Ian Bethel, who served on the mediation team, said recently, &#8220;One 
  of the things I constantly struggle with is the culture of denial that exists 
  in this country when it comes to racism. Even during the mediation process you&#8217;d 
  see that denial. There is systematic racism right in front of us and people 
  refuse to see it.&#8221; The Archbishop of the Twin Cities, in his recent Pastoral 
  Letter on racism, says that, in order to end the “sin of racism,” we need to 
  keep talking with each other about it, then convert that talk into action all 
  the while helping society live by the Golden Rule (which we also outline in 
  Chapters 5 and 17 of our book, a book which documents the racism so all can 
  see it). But denial exists in our community too. Thus, City Pages, the Minnesota 
  Spokesman-Recorder, and the Urban League have engaged the discussion of racism 
  and the accompanying suggestions for working out solutions in The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes. But The Star Tribune, Insight News and the NAACP have 
  not, and are in denial about what the book “sees”. Let us resolve, therefore, 
  to let our willingness to listen to others become greater than our eagerness 
  to shout them down. Then, let us resolve to give a fair hearing to the ideas 
  and suggestions the “common YESes and NOs” in the book and in the “Solution Papers” of www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, including <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm"> 
  The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together </a> 
  and <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven Solutions 
  </a>in order to enable us, working together, to close the gaps between Blacks 
  and Whites in terms of education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing and ethical leadership of hope. We are a victorious people who do 
  will not give up on the dream of the possibilities. And what are your resolutions 
  for 2004?
