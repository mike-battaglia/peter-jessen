<p><strong>Seeking justice for Courtney Clark&rsquo;s mother.</strong><br>
Courtney Clark is no angel, but he is still his mother&rsquo;s son, one who is incarcerated in the Faribault prison.&nbsp; She called me about his conditions, seeking help in her attempt to get justice for her son.&nbsp; She fears that his treatment is hastening his death. &nbsp;Though a prisoner for unlawful deeds, &nbsp;nothing changes the fact that he is her son and that he is still one of God&rsquo;s children and that he, as everyone else, is due what we call &ldquo;civil&rdquo; and &ldquo;human&rdquo; rights (the U.N. has versions and recently Arabs signed on to versions of human rights as well).</p>
<p>No &ldquo;declarations&rdquo; or &ldquo;conventions&rdquo; of humah rights allow for retaliation, reduction or elimination of meds, official &ldquo;tossing&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s cell (taking of personal materials and case research), nor being dumped into the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; (as especially egregious form of solitary confinement).&nbsp;&nbsp; All the while, he is in a wheel chair. &nbsp;This has happened to Courtney Clark.&nbsp; He blew the whistle on experiments being conducted in Faribault on Black prisoners at the Faribault Reformatory.&nbsp; For that he was shipped off to the California Corrections System which, upon seeing how ill he was and that he ahd been denied his meds, sent him back. &nbsp;&nbsp;Others have died from such treatment (as happened to Robert Mims last week:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20120711_Ruthless_killer_Robert__lsquo_Nudie__Mims_dies_in_prison.html">&hellip;Mims dies in prison</a>, at the Minnesota<strong> </strong>Correctional Facility-Faribault.&nbsp; Here is <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20120710_Robert__quot_Nudie_quot__Mims__69__serving_life_for_robbery_and_murder__dies.html">more Mims background</a> from the <em><a href="http://www.philly.com">Philadelphia Inquirer</a></em>).&nbsp; Courtney Clark is near death.&nbsp; Read more about it in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, <em>Star Tribune</em>, and <em>Spokesman-Recorder</em>.&nbsp; Never forget:&nbsp; what &ldquo;they&rdquo; can do to &ldquo;them,&rdquo; &ldquo;they&rdquo; can do to &ldquo;us.&rdquo;<br>
