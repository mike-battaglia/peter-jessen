<p><strong>First: Call to the Mayor and City Council<br>
  Second: Call to the Minneapolis Community (citizens, neighborhood organizations, 
  churches, voluntary organizations, corporations, small businesses, etc).</strong> 
<p><strong>CALL TO THE MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL</strong> Be People of Resolution 
  and Solution to Achieve the Prize of Freedom: equal access and equal opportunity 
  for all.</p>
<p>The following letter from the Beacon on the Hill Press publisher sent to the 
  Mayor and the City council is an open invitation to Review the book and critique 
  the solutions proposed as a way to begin a Minneapolis "family discussion" to 
  first resolve to solve and then act <strong>to solve the city's problems in 
  the seven areas of education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, and ethics,</strong> and then either keep the book for future reference 
  or donate the book to a library (public, school, government, agency, college 
  or university, etc.), as the last time they were sent a copy of the book (see 
  <a href=09letterminn_jul2003.htm>4-3-03 Letter to Mayor and City Council</a>) 
  most returned their copy of the book saying they couldn't receive "gifts," even 
  when they were not sent as gifts. 
<p><strong>Publisher's letter</strong> 
<p>Dear Minneapolis Mayor and City Council Members, 
<p>The enclosed book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> is <strong>NOT 
  a gift! </strong> This is a review copy, also called "surplus" copy. If you still 
  feel you have to return it as you did last time, give it instead to a library. 
  Then, as now, it is sent as input from a citizen, a community person, Ron Edwards, 
  to add to the public dialogue of issues facing the city. Ron is a citizen you 
  all have, do, and will interact with in some way. My original letter concluded 
  with (see https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/letter2.html): "If you have 
  any further questions or wish to use the book for discussion groups, as some 
  have suggested, or other uses, just let us at Beacon on the Hill Press know 
  how we can help." I noted then that (emphasis added): 
<p>The book uses the term &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racist.&#8221; These terms are <strong>not</strong> used 
  to emotionally obscure fuzzy thinking about the causes of poverty, inequality, 
  different levels of school achievement, etc., about which there is much debate 
  (but, as Ron says <strong>Nellie Stone Johnson</strong> always used to remind him, <strong>&#8220;No 
  education, no jobs, no housing, no hope&#8221;).</strong> Ron uses the terms <strong>to build 
  on the Star Tribune&#8217;s 1991 series on racism in Minnesota (&#8221;Issues of Race&#8221;)</strong> 
  as he notes in Interlude 2. The terms refer to the prejudice, discrimination, 
  segregation, bigotry, and bias used to deny equal access and equal opportunity, 
  something [many] Whites did not see [in 1991] as an issue. 
<p>In a word, the book is about the <strong>gaps</strong> that still exist between Blacks 
  and Whites in education, jobs, housing, and public safety, why they happened 
  and how to close them. One school of public policy thought blames it innately 
  on Blacks, hence the legality of slavery and Jim Crow. Current public policy 
  follows the 1968 Kerner Commission Report that stated Blacks can't make it on 
  their own and thus need the support and direction of the government (continued 
  by the 1998 "The Bell Curve" that concludes the same saying Blacks are too dumb 
  to make it on their own). These public policy assumptions have kept Blacks from 
  the table of equal access and equal opportunity. In his book Ron calls for changes 
  in public policy in the gap areas to begin to undo the damage caused by those 
  assumptions. As you are the closest to public policy making you are the ones 
  best able to reverse bad policy instituted by your predecessors. However, each 
  time a policy group doesn't do so, they too become part of the reasons for the 
  gaps. That is not a "blame" statement. It is a legacy statement. Certainly all 
  of us realize that we live in a world that is not free of intellectual difficulties, 
  not free of insoluable problems, such that if we would just all have good will 
  these problems would be solved. Breaking the cycle of welfare dependency for 
  both Blacks and Whites (not to mention corporations) and enabling long-term 
  employment is still a shared goal without a clear "how to" answer in our post-agricultural, 
  post-industrial, information dominated economy. But Ron lists specific "how's" 
  for closing the gaps. 
<p>Ron doesn't suggest in his book that "ought" equals "can." He does suggest 
  that the gaps can be closed and outlines a process for achieving it. To do so, 
  the <strong>first requirement</strong> is to repudiate the 1968 policy base of the Kerner 
  Commission Report that Blacks are "unable" to make it on their own and thus 
  need government support and direction. The <strong>second requirement</strong> is the 
  political will to act with appropriate public policy reflecting a repudiation 
  of Kerner policy. This is not to deny government programs. But it is hard to 
  argue with the empirical reality that "American capitalism is the most efficient 
  antipoverty machine the world has ever seen." Government can help but not when 
  its programs are never doubted or, worse, excused when they do actual, proven 
  damage, as seen in the <strong>gaps</strong> Ron articulates in his book that government 
  policy helped create. Those are addressable. Ron recognizes the insight of JFK 
  that the economic system is not some monolith acting on people. Rather, people 
  act upon it, hence JFK's "don't ask what government can do for you" question, 
  but rather, instead, ask what people can do for themselves and for the government. 
  In other words, Ron's book avoids the anthropomorphic attitude of an economic 
  "system" that always places the key role on government. 
<p><strong>We would like to receive your thoughts</strong> on Ron's suggestions 
  for closing the <strong>gaps</strong> by insuring there is a place at the table 
  for everyone, as outlined in <strong> (1) </strong> the suggestions of the book 
  gathered together in Chapter 17, that have been expanded and arranged into <strong> 
  (2) the <a href=22actualize.htm>7 Solutions</a> </strong> paper and <strong> 
  (3) </strong> the <a href=23tableblocks.htm>Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a>, 
  paper (both being in the Solution Papers section of www.TheMinneapolisStory.com 
  web site). We believe Minneapolis can use these to either show the way to other 
  cities on how to solve the problems of the inner city or it can continue the 
  opposite, showing America how to keep inner city Blacks down and "in their place". 
<p>In the <strong>8/31/03 7 Solutions</strong> piece, David Jennings is quoted, at <strong>7.f, 
  </strong> following a statement of his in the Strib in 2000, of the need to hold 
  public discussions, what he called a "family meeting," on critical issues facing 
  the city. In this case, 7 issues to start the discussion are listed. <strong>Table 
  Blocks</strong> would serve as a wonderful framework for such discussions. It and 
  7 Solutions are available free on the web site. To contribute to the discussion, 
  we are willing to offer the book at discount for groups at $7.50 each for multiple 
  orders, plus S&H. Let us know if there are other ways in which we can be of 
  help. 
<p>Sincerely yours, 
<p>Peter Jessen<br>

<p><strong>CALL TO THE COMMUNITY, 12-11-03</strong> 
<p><strong>Call to the Minneapolis Community (Call to the Minneapolis Community (citizens, 
  neighborhood organizations, churches, voluntary organizations, corporations, 
  small businesses, etc)): Become apart of the solution, not the problem: Be People 
  of Resolution and Solution to Achieve the Prize of Freedom: equal access and 
  equal opportunity for all.</strong> 
<p>There are several wonderful pieces to use to help discuss the 7 critical areas 
  of need in Minneapolis (education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, ethcis). Several come to mind that could be used to hold discussions, 
  workshops, and seminars, especially <strong> (1) </strong> the book, <i>The 
  Minnenapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> <strong> (2) </strong> the <a href=22actualize.htm https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html">7 
  Solutions</a> paper , (3) the <a href=23tableblocks.htm www.theminneapolisstory.com/pages/tableblocks.html  "> 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks </a> paper ("The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis 
  Table for All to Sit at Together"), and (4) the materials on the web site of 
  www.theminneapolisstory.com. Will we let yesterday's questions haunt tomorrows 
  answers? Will we strive to meet High Hopes or continue the status quo of Hopeless 
  Helplessness? Dream Fulfillment or Dream Deferment." For this holiday season, 
  my publisher is offering the book at a special price of $15 each, or $10 each 
  for orders for 10 or more, or $7.50 each for orders over 10 for discussion groups 
  of community and voluntary organizations (plus S&H). The books can be ordered 
  from either <a href=http://www.BeaconOnTheHill.com>www.BeaconOnTheHill.com</a> 
  or from <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com>www.TheMinneapolisStory.com</a>
