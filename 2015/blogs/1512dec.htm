<p><strong>IN MEMORIUM, </strong>December 2, 2015<strong><br>
  Dorothy E. Miller,</strong> of Kansas City, Missouri, my beloved mother, passed away on Thursday, November 27, 2015, at her Kansas City home, at age 95.  She was preceded in death by her parents.  She was the daughter of Dr. L. Virgil and Katie Miller.  She was a graduate of West Virginia State University, a historically black public university in Institute, West Virginia, in the Charleston-metro area.  She taught in the Kansas City School District for 52 years.  She was featured in Ebony Magazine for her active participation in many social organizations and clubs, and especially for her work with underprivileged children. <br>
  <br>
  She was an active member of The Kansascitian, a major Kansas City club for African Americans, founded by her mother.   She also often helped her father, Dr. L. Virgil Miller, who had a dual professional practice, as he was both a medical doctor and an attorney-at-law.  Dr. Miller was close to president Harry S. Truman. </p>
<p>She is survived by her sister Virgiline and her husband Bill, of Braderton, Florida, her son Ronald A. Edwards, of Minneapolis, MN, her grandson Brian Jones in Los Angeles, CA, and by her nephew, Craig Bowman, of Kansas City.   Services will be held on Monday, December 8, 2015, at 11:00 am, at Watkins Heritage Chapel, in Kansas City.</p>
