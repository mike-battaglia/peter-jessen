<p><strong>Blog #3. 3-7-04: Let us not leave Black History Month Behind</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Black History Must be Remembered and Celebrated DAILY until we no longer 
  have to say, as did Moses: “Let My People Go” </strong> 
<p>Two books from 2002 and a third to come out this year address not only our 
  Black history and our African American history but Minneapolis history as well. 
  These books help us to celebrate it and remind us why we must make every effort 
  to see that it is not erased. The first is Harry Davis&#8217; book <strong><i>Overcoming,</i></strong> 
  a powerful word defining the progress that has come from the struggle of all 
  African Americans in Minneapolis (see Column #4). The other book is <strong><i>The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</i></strong>. No African American in Minneapolis 
  worthy of his or her history can claim authentically to have that history unless 
  they have read these two books that not only explain and strengthen our roots, 
  but connect us to them so that we remain firm in our struggle to keep our eye 
  on the prize until all of our people have equal access and equal opportunity. 
  A third book will soon be available, in March of 2004, a continuation or “Vol. 
  II” of <strong><i>The Minneapolis Story,</i></strong> a book that will be entitled <strong><i>The 
  Story of America’s Inner Cities As Seen in the Black Experience of Minneapolis, 
  Mn,</i></strong> a book that will be available on this web site. 
<p>What greater tragedy than for our children and our children&#8217;s children not 
  to know our struggles and be proud of what we have accomplished, accomplishments 
  far greater than any White person&#8217;s struggle born on the other side of the aisle 
  of slavery, Jim Crow, and continued discrimination? 
<p><strong>February’s Black History Month needs to remembered year round. </strong> We need 
  better habits of remembering, practiced weekly if not daily, to remind us not 
  only of our wonderful history but the wonderful history that can be ours to 
  make if we don’t take our eyes off the prize. Begin with these books. But history 
  is not our idol. History has a way of playing cruel tricks on those who chase 
  it through rear view mirrors. It is the future made in the present that counts. 
  The truth in history is what <i>Overcoming</i> as well as the Chapters and Historic 
  Interludes of <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</i> provide. So let&#8217;s 
  celebrate our history and continue to work to make history by building our better 
  tomorrows today. 
<p>When Moses was kicked out of Egypt they erased his name so there was no trace 
  left of him. We cannot allow the great markers of our history to leave us without 
  a trace of our past. If Nellie Stone Johnson and her DFL co-founder Hubert Humphrey 
  were still with us, they would lead us in the cause. Where is the DFL and the 
  NAACP, and why are they AWOL from the civil rights struggle today? Why are they 
  silent? Why don’t they embrace or at least explore the solutions documents on 
  this web site, especially <strong> (1)</strong> <a href=../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm>Seven 
  Solution areas</a> and <strong>(2) </strong> <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together</a> 
  Why? What are people afraid of? To find out, start by reading these books.
