<p><strong>Solution Paper #31, July 14, 2008: Ending the City's and MPD's COVER-UP OF DISCRIMINATION will help to end the Discrimination in the Minneapolis Police Department</strong></p>
<p>Speaking over the silence of the major Twin Cities Dailies. From pp. 57-68, 83-94 of <a href="http://www.BeaconOnTheHill.com" target="_blank">A Seat for Everyone: The Freedom Guide that Explores A Vision for America, by Ron Edwards</a>. Available to order from: <a href="http://www.BeaconOnTheHill.com" target="_blank">Beacon On The Hill Press</a>. Read  specially selected archived columns and blog. All columns and blog entries are from the book, <strong>A Seat for Everyone</strong>, except those after March 1, 2008. All referenced columns and blog entries below are listed in the archives of our web site. </p>
<p>Also below: sections on The War Against Young Black Men, on local journalism, and on suggested solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The American Dream cannot be a selective one for certain circles or certain interest groups. America cannot be a beacon of light to the world and a model of democratic participation until all of its citizens have equal access and equal opportunity, meaning that there is a seat for everyone.&quot; <br>
&#8212;  Ron Edwards, <cite>A Seat for Everyone: The Freedom Guide that Explores A Vision for America</cite>, p. 60 </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Keefe column</strong><br>
<a href="../2007/columns/07q3.htm#0718c0829">A profile in courage and integrity &#8212; the saga of Lt. Michael Keefe</a>, August 29, 2007. In this column you will read about a White police officer who took a stand to fight prejudice and discrimination within the MPD, an officer I have never met, but who shares the dream of creating an amalgam of race for a better country. He has met with unjust and unfair retaliation, and has subsequently sued the city and the department.&quot; The upshot is that &quot;the FBI agents reported egregious resistance o working with African Americans with the 'point&quot; made using the &quot;N&quot; word and other racially charged and derogatory terms about Black police officers. In addition to that, The Violent Offenders Task Force arrests were 98+% African Americans, with no Black officer in its history, with a disturbing pattern of significant overtime abuse (see pp. 58 and 65). </p>
<p><strong>The blog essay on the 5 black officers' law suit</strong><br>
<a href="../2007/blogs/0712dec.htm">Five Black Officers Sue the City For Discrimination, as the Twin Towers of Minneapolis' Nullification and Reversal Begin To Finally Crumble</a>, December 14, 2007. This is a historic case that could place the department in federal receivership, as was done to the Fire Department nearly 30 years ago. </p>

<p><strong>Local journalism (or the lack thereof) </strong><br>
A leading problem in Minneapolis is the lack of credible journalism. The pieces listed below are several columns and blog entries that discuss how <strong>The Star Tribune</strong> censors writers and stories it doesn't agree with it, including my first book in 2002. It hides from the public what is going on in the Police Department, which enables the situation to get worse, not better. </p>
