<p><strong>The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together <br>
  </strong>By Ron Edwards and Peter Jessen<br>
  Based on <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>, by Ron Edwards as told to Peter Jessen </p>
<p> Note: <strong>C</strong>#s and <strong>B</strong>#s refer to <strong>C</strong>olumns 
  and <strong>B</strong>logs (web log entries) on <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com 
  </a> </p>
<p><strong>Action outline </strong> of how to use <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes, </i> by Ron Edwards, a story reflected in every American city (as well 
  as rural areas in the South) that have concentrations of the descendents of 
  American slaves (that special group of immigrants of the 17th, 18th, and 19th 
  centuries not allowed to be educated or to build wealth over time). It is a 
  <strong>story of </strong> <strong>GAPS that need to be filled. </strong> Let's 
  enjoy life and have some fun doing so, reconciled together, positively focusing 
  on the dream, the possibilities, the right. Though freed by law after the Civil 
  War, slaves and their descendents have been consistently subjected to deferments 
  of that freedom, first by Jim Crow and secondly by The 1968 Kerner Commission 
  Report, which is quasi Jim Crow in disguise, that states that as Blacks are 
  not like other immigrants and can't make it on their own, they require government 
  support and direction. This is racism. The 1998 book <i>The Bell Curve </i> 
  says Blacks aren't bright enough and thus also says Blacks must be under government 
  support and direction. This too is racism. So, whether from the political left 
  or right, these opposites in content recommend the same process: descendents 
  of American slaves placed under government support and direction, despite the 
  fact that the greatest growth in middle class status today is being achieved 
  by Blacks (evidence doesn't mean much to those who have already made up their 
  minds). This <strong>IDEA </strong> lies at the root of our problem today. To 
  meet the challenge for tomorrow, these parts of Kerner and Bell must be repudiated 
  today. It has led to polices in education/jobs/housing/growth, etc., that <strong>have 
  </strong> <strong>left descendents of slaves behind, </strong> whether in the 
  poverty/crime ridden containment areas of our inner cities, in rural Southern 
  areas of Blacks, or in prisons. The <i>Minneapolis Story </i> resources listed 
  here will help with understanding the past and present in order to successfully 
  meet the challenge of the future so that the descendents of America&#8217;s 
  slaves may finally be fully integrated into the mainstream of society and culture 
  and be at the table with everyone. This can be used in discussions, seminars, 
  workshops, dinners and other formats to provide leaders of same with the information 
  and strategies they need to acknowledge and effect needed change of fairness 
  and justice. <strong>Understanding the Past: (the good and the bad, and carry 
  forward the hope and the dream) </strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Read <strong><i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, </i> </strong> by 
    Ron Edwards as told to Peter Jessen, and especially the summary of the book's 
    recommendations in Chapter 17 and the history "Interludes." </li>
  <li>There is an <strong><a href="01econrace.htm">economic and personal cost 
    of racism</a> </strong> to both individuals and the institutions of the city 
    and state. </li>
  <li><a href="20restore.htm">Restorative Affirmative Action</a><strong> </strong> 
    provides historical perspective for how to finally <strong>end the dream's 
    deferment: </strong> focus on the descendents of slaves, and let separate 
    laws/groups/protocols/movements deal with women, GLBT, immigrants, disabled 
    (physically, mentally), etc. show how to redefine and recast Civil Rights 
    with an ethic that levels the playing field to enable American Blacks who 
    are descendents of slaves a chance at equal access and equal opportunity in 
    order to set and then meet goals <strong>to close the Black-White gaps </strong> 
    in education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, and governing. 
    <strong> </strong><strong>Understanding the Present: (the good and the bad, 
    having fun reaffirming the hope and the dream)</strong></li>

  <li><strong><i>The Story of America's Inner Cities As Told by the Example of 
    Minneapolis, Mn, as Yesterday's Questions Haunt Tomorrow's Answers: High Hopes 
    or Hopeless Helplessness? Dream Fulfillment or Dream Deferment? </i> </strong> 
    by Ron Edwards with Peter Jessen, includes 2003's weekly columns as they 
    appeared in <i>The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, </i> the Solution Papers/essays, 
    and the daily Blog (web log) entries of <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com

  <li><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com 
    </a> <strong>web page </strong> with its on-going continuation of the Minneapolis 
    Story with its weekly columns, daily web log, and Solution Papers.</li>
  <li>Read <strong>Black newspapers </strong> to get a sense of how the City still 
    follows "legal" and "moral" policies that are corrupted by racist principles, 
    which is why White newspapers cannot always be trusted which is why we also 
    need to have in our communities <a href="05whynewspapers.htm">Black newspapers.</a></li>
  <li>Read <i>The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, </i> which carries the weekly 
    column and provides the wider canvas recording and reporting the Black experience 
    as it unfolds in Minneapolis. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong> 
  </strong><strong>THE GAPS to close:  
   (to reverse the bad and the ugly to enact a vision of hope and fulfill 
  the dream) </strong><strong> 
  </strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Education </strong> (Chapter 7): <strong>huge gap </strong> in performance 
    between Blacks and Whites in reading/writing/math.</li>
  <li><strong>Jobs </strong> (Chapter 9): <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">city 
    in non-compliance </strong> with Federal and city construction contract system</li>
  <li><strong>Housing </strong> (Chapter 8): <strong>Hollman </strong> as example 
    of razing Black housing to then raise White housing</li>
  <li><strong>Public Safety </strong> (Chapter 16, Blog #214): <strong>accepting 
    unrest and disturbance </strong> as the acceptable price of maintaining the 
    status quo and using police to keep Blacks in their place.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe Environment </strong> (Chapters 1, 5, 8): <strong>gap </strong> 
    <strong>in quality </strong> of air/water/soil of Black and White communities</li>
  <li><strong>Governing </strong> (Chapter 3, 10, 11-13, Blogs #218 and 227): 
    by <strong>courts and councils and boards </strong> (gerrymandered redistricting, 
    DFL 1 party rule, city unions, non-profits). </li>
  <li><strong>Ethical Leadership of Hope </strong> (Chapter 2, 4-6, 14-15, 17, 
    Conclusion): equal access &amp; opportunity for all with all at the mainstream 
    table, "here, there and everywhere" with racism, bigotry, segregation &amp; 
    discrimination "not here, not there, not anywhere," using the Golden Rule, 
    Common YESes &amp; NOs. </li>
</ol>
<p> 
  <strong>Understanding the future:   
  CLOSING THE GAPS (education, jobs, housing, with smiles of fun and energy) </strong> 
  <strong> 
  </strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow <a href="22actualize.htm">7 Solutions</a><strong> </strong> updates 
    and expands Chapter 17 of "The Minneapolis Story," in <strong>the 7 areas 
    with </strong> <strong>the major Black-White gaps: </strong> (1) education, 
    (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, 
    and (7) Black-White ethics. <strong>7.f: </strong> Hold a public discussion, 
    a "family meeting," on the gaps in these seven areas. </li>
  <li>Engage <a href="18ubuntu.htm">"Ubuntu" reconciliation</a><strong> </strong> 
    of Blacks and Blacks and Blacks and Whites. Do so through the <strong>common 
    YESes and common NOs </strong> of Chapters 5 and 17. "Ubuntu" reconciliation 
    was the approach of Desmond Tutu in South Africa to bring together the oppressor 
    Whites and oppressed Blacks of Apartheid (see <strong>B </strong> log entries 
    #163, 164, 172). </li>
  <li><strong>Start with education </strong> <strong>(Chapter 7): </strong> Nellie 
    Stone Johnson said <strong>"No education, no jobs, no housing, no hope." </strong> 
    Merit, not class, must be the base, for all, "the content of character not 
    the color of skin." BUT, education is not unattainable if elementary school 
    is made unattainable even when sitting in class. Poor schools = poor teachers, 
    poor methodology, less resources and less support. As Sandra Scar says: <strong>"Opportunity 
    breeds predestination," </strong> and opportunity starts with education. The 
    key to realizing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is to 
    press for equal access and equal opportunity, to make the <strong>life start 
    </strong> a strong start in <strong>both </strong> Head Start (as originally 
    designed as opposed to today's watered down program mixing those who need 
    it with those who don't, a baby sitting operation harmful to those most in 
    need of it) <strong>and </strong> elementary education. <strong>Needed </strong> 
    : original focus of Head Start, better trained teachers, upgrade of early 
    education, reduced class sizes, teach "whatever" but all on foundation of 
    the basics of reading, writing, 'rithmetic, matching teaching styles to student 
    learning styles, and demonstrating expectation of learning success, not failure. 
    See Blogs #215-216. </li>
  <li><strong>Retrieve the "Moral Mantel" </strong> of when White churches and 
    corporations marched with Black churches &amp; Black organizations and end 
    the withdrawing/giving up on Blacks (see Blog #203). Unite through the <strong>unique 
    music </strong> <strong>of spiritual </strong> <strong>and </strong> <strong>pop, 
    and unleash happy warriors. </strong> Engage corporations positively (see 
    Blog #206). </li>
  <li>Reform the <strong>NAACP </strong> and the <strong>Urban League </strong> 
    so that they provide a forum for all voices of the Black heterogeneous community 
    of descendents of America's slaves, and once again keep the <a href="12eyeoffprize.htm">eye 
    on the prize</a> in order to finish the <a href="14unfinsheddream.htm">unfinished 
    dream</a>. See Blogs 195-6, 198-202, 208-10). </li>
  <li>Engage in the steps of <strong>mediation </strong> and <a href="08conflictresmodel.htm">conflict 
    resolution</a><strong> </strong> to bring the different voices together on 
    the common ground of common YESes and NOs.</li>
  <li><a href="13emergency.htm">Stop the war on youth</a><strong> </strong> and 
    provide them with <a href="19higherhopes.htm">Higher hope than hip hop. </a></li>
  <li><a href="15nineeleven.htm">Remember 9-11</a><strong> </strong> and the many 
    Black veterans of our wars as well (Blog # 217), but not at the expense of 
    our inner cities. Increase the number of Blacks in police and fire departments. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>Establish strategic new spokesmen, </strong> <strong>(1) </strong> 
    those arguing before the courts and advocating in legislatures and city councils, 
    as well as <strong>(2) </strong> public spokesmen and advocates in communities 
    and meetings, in person and in the print and broadcast and other media. <strong>(3) 
    </strong> the rest of us holding high hopes for the removal of hopeless helplessness. 
    The reality of the civil rights movement is that its success required <strong>both 
    </strong> the out front advocacy of leaders like MLK, <strong>and </strong> 
    the behind the scenes advocates by leaders such as Thurgood Marshall arguing 
    before the courts, especially the Supreme Court, and Clarence Mitchell (&#8221;Mr. 
    Civil Rights&#8221;) tirelessly working the halls of Congress in Washington, 
    D.C. to get the votes for civil rights legislation, <strong>along with </strong> 
    an army of follower-leaders with joy and happiness in their hearts as they 
    march for the good and the positive, for the joy of the dream. This is needed 
    in both Minneapolis as a city and St. Paul as a capital, of people working 
    with the committees, especially their Chairs, in the city and the capital, 
    to promote the kind of laws/regulations/statutes needed to achieve the kind 
    of progress sought: equal access and equal opportunity, especially as it relates 
    to education in the <strong>schools </strong> (State &amp; city education 
    departments take note), employment in the labor market <strong>job sites, 
    </strong> and housing in the <strong>neighborhoods. </strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Stop breaking federal/state/city laws/regulations/rules/statues 
    </strong> re education, jobs, and housing. </li>
  <li>Work with <strong>measures of accountability </strong> to judge actions 
    and promises of officials and institutions. </li>
  <li>Publish all government dollars spent, whether spent by public or private 
    spenders. </li>
  <li><strong>Be </strong><a href="07whistleblower.htm">whistleblowers</a><strong> 
    </strong> when necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop </strong> <strong>disenfranching </strong> minorities. </li>
  <li>Get Star Tribune and other media to work to heal, not slay (see Blogs 190, 
    191, and 213). Extend coverage from cover stories in <i>City Pages, The Minnesota 
    Spokesman-Recorder </i> and the <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com 
    </a> web page provided by publisher Beacon on the Hill Press, by adding coverage 
    purposefully missing from the Star Tribune, Insight News, One Nation News, 
    KMOJ Forum. </li>
