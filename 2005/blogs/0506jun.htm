<p><strong>6-24-2005/#66:  U.S. Supreme Court adopts the Minneapolis Model, 
  rules cities may seize homes: &#8220;Public Use&#8221; can now be used for the 
  old &#8220;urban renewal = Negro Removal&#8221;, but now blight need not be present, 
  just the city&#8217;s definition at the time. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Has the liberal Supreme Court learned from the DFL in Minneapolis? 
  Is it the Minneapolis Model they are using, as they rule not for &#8220;the people&#8221; 
  but for the special interests of their friends and city plantation masters, 
  making &#8220;Urban Reneal = Negro Removal&#8221; much easier?  They have now given 
  Minneapolis the ultimate in &#8220;tools&#8221; to bull doze North Minneapolis and scatter 
  people of color through &#8220;takings&#8221; of our neighborhoods for the &#8220;public good.&#8221; 
  </strong></p>
<p>Tyrone Terrill put his fellow blacks on notice with his shape up or get out &#8220;open letter.&#8221; The liberals on the Supreme Court have now put Blacks and non-tax 
  payers on notice:  get rich or get out. Hollman anyone? </p>
<p>Yahoo news reported yesterday that the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050623/ap_on_go_su_co/scotus_seizing_property/nc:701;_ylt=AqQVEBWeOhNr6JoE2_H52ERMEP0E;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl" target="_blank">Supreme 
  Court Rules Cities May Seize Homes.</a></p>
<p>In other words, the liberals on the Supreme Court overruled the conservatives, 
  5-4, ruling that &#8220;Cities may bulldoze people&#8217;s homes to make way 
  for shopping malls or other private development,&#8230;giving local governments 
  broad power to seize private property to generate tax revenue.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yahoo reports that &#8220;The four-member liberal bloc (Stephens, Ginsberg, Breyer, 
  Souter], typically has favored greater deference to cities.&#8221;  They were 
  joined by Justice Kennedy.  Justice Stephens wrote the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=04-108#opinion1" target="_blank">opinion</a> 
  and Justice Kennedy wrote the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=04-108#concurrence1" target="_blank">concurrence</a> 
  for the liberal majority, justified the ruling under their interpretation of 
  the Fifth Amendment, &#8220;which allows governments to take private property if the 
  land is for public use,&#8221; the excuse being that &#8220;since the project the city has 
  in mind promises to bring more jobs and revenue&#8221; it is, therefore, &#8220;for public 
  use.&#8221;  In other words, private property and liberty be damned.  
  All on a &#8220;promise,&#8221; on a guess. In other words, this helps solidify those who 
  see a liberal agenda to install nation wide top down ruling by the elites of 
  the Democratic party and their fellow travellers in the universities. That has 
  been the story in Minneapolis. Now &#8220;the Minneapolis Model&#8221; gets rolled 
  out across the country. </p>
<p>Justice O&#8217;Connor wrote the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=04-108#dissent1" target="_blank">minority 
  dissent</a> for [herself and Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas). 
   Brother Justice Thomas wrote a separate <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=04-108#dissent2" target="_blank">dissent</a> 
  . </p>
<p>Yahoo reports that, in dissent, &#8220;O&#8217;Connor criticized the majority 
  for abandoning the&#8230;principle of individual property rights&#8221; and 
  for &#8220;handing &#8216;disproportionate influence and power&#8217; to the 
  well-heeled&#8221; and city governments. </p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor wrote that &#8220;The specter of condemnation hangs over all property,&#8221; 
  as now &#8220;Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with 
  a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>This is not small potatoes.  Nationwide, more than 10,000 properties 
  have been threatened or condemned in recent years. Here is the biggie:  
  the property involved in this case was not run down, was not blighted, etc. 
   Just working class homes.  Here is the other biggie:  all 
  it requires for such out of your house life shattering decisions to be made 
  is if local government can show the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of jobs and taxes.  </p>
<p>This very much relates to Minneapolis.  Our city has overreached and 
  over spent and needs more taxes.  Blacks in North Minneapolis and South 
  Minneapolis are on prime, cheaper land. How easy, now, to run the poor and Black 
  out of their homes to create tax creators (of course if they get Target-like 
  deals we&#8217;ll lose our homes and the city still won&#8217;t get much in taxes, but oh 
  how all who touch these Midas projects will benefit individually, bureacrats, 
  council persons, legislators and developers).  Just as the USSR countries 
  did, the government can now come in and bulldoze any working class or poor neighborhood 
  and start pouring the cement.  Got gangs?  Not in the public interest: 
   bulldoze them.  Have Black kids standing idly on corners? 
   Not in the public interest:  bulldoze them.  We have seen 
  them scatter the former Hollman residents to the four winds.  No blight 
  required. No project success guarantee required.</p>
<p>Now they can do it more easily and faster, and all &#8220;for the public good.&#8221;  
  And in Minneapolis that means whatever the DFL says it means.  As the 
  King in &#8220;The King and I&#8221; says: &#8220;let it be said, liet it be so. 
  It is Nike time: &#8220;just do it.&#8221; Bye bye &#8220;we the people,&#8221; 
  bye bye liberty, bye bye property rights, bye bye individual freedom. Bob Dylon 
  sang &#8220;the times they are a changin.&#8221; And so they are. This is another 
  example of liberals abandoning the cities where they have redlined Blacks out 
  and now can move them out. Who stood up for us? The conservatives, who in their 
  disset are trying to free us from the liberal plantation masters that run the 
  cities. Who would have guessed? For more Minneapolis examples of this &#8220;Minneapolis 
  Model,&#8221; see every chapter of my book. </p>
<p>Why provide good education for Blacks when you can just run them out on &#8220;takings.&#8221; 
   </p>
<p>Now the Minneapolis Planning Model tries to go nation wide.  Recall our 
  Chapter 8 on housing, and the McKinsey report that by the time the planning 
  agencies and developers were done, nearly $1 billion had been spent (mostly 
  on planning) resulting in a net gain of 52 housing units.  Now Minneapolis 
  won&#8217;t have to bother with fake housing projects to rake in the money for its 
  monied bureaucrats:  they&#8217;ll reverse:  kick people out of their 
  homes so they can pocket even more money by &#8220;serving&#8221; fellow planners and developers, 
  all for their self deefined &#8220;public good&#8221;.  The Supreme Court 
  just completed the final piece of the liberal project:  total control 
  of the land, &#8220;we the people&#8221; be damned. </p>
<p>And who among the nine justices most forcibly stands up for Blacks?  
  Brother Justice Thomas.  He writes in his dissent (emphasis added): </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Of all the <strong>families displaced by urban renewal from 1949 through 
    1963, 63 percent of those whose race was known were nonwhite, and of these 
    families, 56 percent of nonwhites and 38 percent of whites had incomes low 
    enough to qualify for public housing, which, however, was seldom available 
    to them.&#8221; </strong><em>Id. </em>, at 28. Public works projects in the 
    1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s <strong>destroyed predominantly minority communities in 
    St. Paul, Minnesota, </strong> and Baltimore, Maryland. <em>Id. </em>, at 
    28-29. <strong>In 1981, urban planners in Detroit, Michigan, uprooted the 
    largely &#8220;lower-income and elderly&#8221; Poletown neighborhood for the 
    benefit of the General Motors Corporation. </strong> J. Wylie, Poletown: Community 
    Betrayed 58 (1989). <strong>Urban renewal projects have long been associated 
    with the displacement of blacks; &#8220;[i]n cities across the country, urban 
    renewal came to be known as &#8216;Negro removal.&#8217;&#8221; </strong> Pritchett, 
    The &#8220;Public Menace&#8221; of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses 
    of Eminent Domain, 21 Yale L. &amp; Pol&#8217;y Rev. 1, 47 (2003). <strong>Over 
    97 percent of the individuals forcibly removed from their homes by the &#8220;slum-clearance&#8221; 
    project upheld by this Court in <em>Berman </em></strong><strong>were black 
    </strong>. <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=US&vol=348&page=30" target="_blank">348 
    U.S., at 30 </a>. Regrettably, the predictable consequence of the Court&#8217;s 
    decision will be to exacerbate these effects. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not in Minneapolis?  Don&#8217;t kid yourselves.  We cover this extensively 
  in or chapter on housing, Chapter 8.  80% of those poor Blacks who used 
  to live there could not be found.  It is doubtful that even 10% of those 
  who lived there before were able to move back. </p>
<p>The case was from Connecticut. You have to admire the chutzpah of the Connecticut 
  state representative who said he was one of the city council members who approved 
  the development over which this ruling was made. He says he was &#8220;charged 
  with doing what&#8217;s best for the 26,000 people who live in New London.&#8221; 
  He used the notion of &#8220;enacting the eminent domain process designed to 
  revitalize a city&#8230;with nowhere to go.&#8221; He defines &#8220;best&#8221; 
  as his one man vote is best for all posture. Can you imagine the sweetheart 
  development deals between the Minneapolis city council, city planners and developers 
  that will now transpire? </p>
<p>Read my analysis in my book&#8217;s Chapter 9 on Minneapolis&#8217; corrupt construction 
  contract system.  And read again Chapter 8 and its discussion of how this 
  has been applied to Minneapolis in The Hollman/Heritage Park Project, which 
  is where Black homes were <em>razed</em> in order to raise white homes in their 
  place.  The Supreme Court&#8217;s liberal wing has now made it easier to have 
  dozens of Hollmans to displace even more Blacks for the benefit of whites.  
  This is an old game in America.  See our book&#8217;s Interlude 8, &#8220;Torn From 
  the Land,&#8221; about southern land taking on the basis of color.  Now it will 
  be easier.  This is all made possible by corrupt, boss-like big city government 
  attempts (the color of the Mayor doesn&#8217;t matter) that is enabled by single party 
  control. We live this in Minneapolis under under the DFL (See my book&#8217;s chapters 
  5 on &#8220;Justice and Fairness&#8221; and the chapters on gerrymandering, Chapters 12-13). 
</p>
<p><strong>See my column of April 20 </strong>, where I outline the nine desired 
  big projects.  Just think how easy things will be using this new Supreme 
  Court ruling on takings to make these happen for <strong>the city planner/city 
  council/DFL/developer/construction complex </strong>.  The nine projects 
  that I wrote about that represent at least a $5 billion pie to be split between 
  this unholy <strong>complex </strong>of groups that hang out &#8220;Blacks need not 
  apply&#8221; signs, are:  <strong>(1) </strong> a football stadium for the University 
  of Minnesota; <strong>(2) </strong> a baseball stadium for our beloved Twins 
  (possibly in Hennepin County behind the Target Center); <strong>(3) </strong> 
  a new casino for Mall of America Phase II; <strong>(4) </strong> major &#8220;destination&#8221; 
  development in Blaine, to include <strong>(5) </strong> a football stadium for 
  the soon-to-be-newly-purchased Minnesota Vikings, and be <strong>(6) </strong> 
  a hub to extend light rail from Minneapolis to St. Cloud, and <strong>(7) </strong> 
  a new casino in that corridor; <strong>(8) </strong> ancillary projects that 
  will be part of or next to these major projects; and <strong>(9) </strong>necessary 
  infrastructure development for them. </p>
<p>And what about the famly tradition of famly cabins by the lake? How long will 
  it take the city guys who own lake land to get a &#8220;public use&#8221; declaration 
  to enable them cobble together proprerties, promising local governments tax 
  money, and then toss families and their lake cabins out so they can build plots 
  of either lake side mansions or lake resorts? </p>
<p><strong>Here is  Jusice O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s opening statement. </strong> 
  Think Minneapolis as you read this and of all the mischief our planners/officials/developers 
  can create for Black Minneapolis (and poor and working class White Minneapolis): 
</p>
<p>Over two centuries ago, just after the Bill of Rights was ratified, Justice 
  Chase wrote: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>An <em>act </em> of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary 
    to the great first principles of the social compact, cannot be considered 
    a rightful exercise of legislative authority&#8230;A few instances will suffice 
    to explain what I mean&#8230;[A] law that takes property from A. and gives 
    it to B: It is against all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a Legislature 
    with <em>such </em> powers; and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they 
    have done it.&#8221; <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull </em>, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) 
    (emphasis deleted). </p>
  <p>Today the Court abandons this long-held, basic limitation on government power. 
    Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable 
    to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might 
    be upgraded&#8212;<em>i.e. </em>, given to an owner who will use it in a way that 
    the legislature deems more beneficial to the public&#8212;in the process. To reason, 
    as the Court does, that the incidental public benefits resulting from the 
    subsequent ordinary use of private property render economic development takings &#8220;for public use&#8221; is to wash out any distinction between private 
    and public use of property&#8212;and thereby effectively to delete the words &#8220;for 
    public use&#8221; from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Here is Justice Thomas&#8217;s opening to his dissent: </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Long ago, William Blackstone wrote that &#8220;the law of the land&#8230;postpone[s] 
    even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private property.&#8221; 
    1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 134-135 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone). 
    The Framers embodied that principle in the Constitution, allowing the government 
    to take property not for &#8220;public necessity,&#8221; but instead for &#8220;public 
    use.&#8221; Amdt. 5. Defying this understanding, the Court replaces the Public 
    Use Clause with a &#8220;&#8217;[P]ublic [P]urpose&#8217;&#8221; Clause, <em>ante 
    </em>, at 9-10 (or perhaps the &#8220;Diverse and Always Evolving Needs of 
    Society&#8221; Clause, <em>ante </em>, at 8 (capitalization added)), a restriction 
    that is satisfied, the Court instructs, so long as the purpose is &#8220;legitimate&#8221; 
    and the means &#8220;not irrational,&#8221; <em>ante </em>, at 17 (internal 
    quotation marks omitted). This deferential shift in phraseology enables the 
    Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project 
    whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, 
    but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for 
    a &#8220;public use.&#8221; </p>
  <p>I cannot agree. If such &#8220;economic development&#8221; takings are for 
    a &#8220;public use,&#8221; any taking is, and the Court has erased the Public 
    Use Clause from our Constitution, as <em>Justice O&#8217;Connor </em>powerfully 
    argues in dissent. <em>Ante </em>, at 1-2, 8-13. I do not believe that this 
    Court can eliminate liberties expressly enumerated in the Constitution and 
    therefore join her dissenting opinion. Regrettably, however, the Court&#8217;s error 
    runs deeper than this. Today&#8217;s decision is simply the latest in a string of 
    our cases construing the Public Use Clause to be a virtual nullity, without 
    the slightest nod to its original meaning. In my view, the Public Use Clause, 
    originally understood, is a meaningful limit on the government&#8217;s eminent domain 
    power. Our cases have strayed from the Clause&#8217;s original meaning, and I would 
    reconsider them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let us repeat Justice Thomas&#8217; words again, as quoted at the beginning of 
  this blog entry: </p>
<blockquote>

    decision will be to exacerbate these effects. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is he final kicker: the &#8220;fair market value&#8221; to be paid in a 
  takings is set at the <strong>appraised value five years prior</strong> to any 
  takings. </p>

<p><strong>6-24-2005/#65: Democrat US Senators, Congressional Black Caucus, and 
  Minneaplis DFL Council members have at least one thing in common: &#8220;mono-diverisity,&#8221; &#8220;mono-political culturalism&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In other words, what do DFL CM Don Samuels, Democratic National Committee 
  Chairman Howard Dean, NY Democratic Senators Chuck Shumer and Hillary Clinton, 
  Illinois Democratic Senator Barack Obama, and the Congressional Black Caucus 
  all have in common?  </strong></p>
<p>They have been engaging in racial demagoguery with a &#8220;mono-diversity&#8221;, &#8220;monoculturalism&#8221; 
  that is dismissive of true civil rights, as they openly attack and attempt to 
  politically excommunicate or eliminate Blacks that &#8220;stray&#8221; from their Democratic 
  Party Plantation. They all want power to the powerful, not power to the people, 
  hence their attacks on the Black sharecropper&#8217;s daughter, Judge Janice Rogers 
  Brown, even <strong>after </strong> they had already agreed to confirm her appointment 
  to the Federal bench.  It is clear why the White politicians do it.  
  But why does Black Senator Obama and the congressional Black Caucus, especially 
  after the book on Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1992, <em>Just Permanent 
  Interests </em>, by William L. Clay, is filled with the double crosses of the 
  Democratic Party against Blacks, from Presidential politics to local politics 
  and every level inbetween. </p>
<p>Judge Brown is a Black conservative woman.  Natalie Johnson-Lee is a 
  liberal, green party council members.  When will we stop letting them 
  define good Blacks as Democrats, even as they oppress Blacks in every urban 
  center of America, often with the help of the very organizations supposedly 
  fighting for our rights and freedom, access and opportunity.  We need 
  Black leaders willing to lead us off the plantation those who would continue 
  to attempt to herd us back onto the DFL plantation.<br>

<p><strong>6-24-2005, Blog/#64:  United We Stand, Divided We Fall, so why 
  is Doug Mann so divisive when we need success in educating our kids, success

<p>It has come to our attention that in the 6-22-05 Minneapolis Forum Internet 
  discussion group [  <a href="http://www.mnforum.com" target="_blank">www.mnforum.com 
  </a> ]  that Doug Mann, for reasons that are far from clear, 
  lumps me and others into a group that is &#8220;not keeping [our educational] eyes 
  on the prize.&#8221;  Doug wrote: </p>

  you didn&#8217;t hear any board member say, &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong here!  Our 
  plan to close the gap didn&#8217;t work! The black-white test score gap got wider. 
  The gap between high and low scoring schools got wider.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Did Randy Statten, Rev. Bethel, Natalie Johnson Lee, Ron Edwards and others

  the gap aren&#8217;t working for our kids.  What went wrong?&#8221; No. Nothing

  calls for educational change and reform mantras for years.  We have and 
  we will continue to work for closing the scandalous and near criminal gaps in 
  educational achievement between whites and students of color.  We say &#8220;DFL masters&#8221; for they are in charge of education at the legislature, in the 
  bureaucracy, in the union, and in most of the teachers.  The DFL has abandoned 
  Nellie Stone Johnson&#8217;s DFL founding credo: &#8220;No education, no jobs, no 
  housing.&#8221; </p>
<p>The purpose of this web log is stated at the top, to help bring about &#8220;Closing 
  the Gaps&#8230;in&#8230;education, jobs, housing.&#8221; Chapter 7 of our book 
  covers this ground in terms of Education. My columns and web log have continued 
  a steady drum beat on the theme that housing requires good paying jobs and good 
  paying jobs require a good education, and that education in Minneapolis has 
  always been woefully and purposefully inadequate. </p>
<p>There is no other explanation to year in and year out huge gaps between white 
  students and students of color.  But we are but individuals, as is Doug. 
   Everyone knows our positions.  We don&#8217;t have any power other than 
  to continue to shine our Beacon of light from our hilltop perspective.  
  The power is vested in the school board, the unions, the educational bureaucracy, 
  the legislature, and the DFL.  All five institutions continuously betray 
  the future of our kids with their insistence that Black kids get the worst service 
  because they don&#8217;t want Blacks to wander off their Minneapolis reservation. 
   And we Blacks continue to elect them.  And they call the people 
  of Kansas stupid. </p>
<p>To bring in spurious and blatantly false charges through innuendoes and slurs 
  suggesting we are not paying attention and not caring when the evidence is clearly 
  the opposite, instead of pointing out the obvious, that the School Board, unions, 
  DFL, legislature and educational bureaucracy don&#8217;t care to change their status 
  quo steady march to pensions, only tars us with them and makes it all look hopeless, 
  thus making the job of clubbing our cubs easier for the School Board, unions, 
  DFL, educational bureaucracy, and classroom teachers, as the sense is created 
  that no one cares and no one will do anything to stop them on their singular 
  purposeful march to benefits now and retirement later.  </p>
<p>Doug&#8217;s anger should be directed at those who would sabotage and thwart the 
  efforts of Superintendent Dr. Thandiwe Peebles to bring about the change needed 
  to upset their status quo apple carts so that there can be a closing of these 
  gaps we continually write about.  It is closing these gaps that will help 
  positively address changing the gang dynamics.  Criticizing those in the 
  forefront of attempting the change you claim to want to see will only cloud 
  the issue and continue the delaying of the closing of the gaps.  The longer 
  these gaps remain open the longer we&#8217;ll have problems on our streets with gangs. 
   With half of our kids dropping out (if not shoved out), not adequately 
  educated, what else is there than gangs?  This is calculatedly so.  
  Better this than have &#8220;them&#8221; mix with us.  Thus, at the top of each page 
  of Chapter 16, we write, &#8220;Unrest, Disturbance: The Status Quo Price Minneapolis 
  is Willing to Pay&#8221; to keep Blacks in their place.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0563b0623"></a>6-23-2005, Blog/#63:  The Re-opening of the discussion about 
  the 1992 Haaf case continues the DFL &#8220;PR Campaign&#8221; to paint Blacks as &#8220;terrorists.&#8221; 
  This time as killers of the peace.  White Minneapolis fires its shot across 
  the bow of the Black community</strong></p>
<p>Doug Grow&#8217;s 6-18-05 column title says it all, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/465/5463493.html" target="_blank">When 
  gang members killed officer at Pizza Shack, peace effort died, too. </a> 
  George Widseth and Robert Streitz, Minneapolis, assistant Hennepin County attorneys, 
  respond in the Strib to Doug&#8217;s column because Doug wrote, &#8220;Though four men are 
  serving life sentences for the killing, <strong>Moss says he doesn&#8217;t 
  believe the shooter was caught</strong>. Their column title 
  sums up their position, as the go ballistic over the comment:  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5467047.html" target="_blank">We 
  got Haaf&#8217;s killer.</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>What Widseth and Streitz don&#8217;t mention is that originally four others were 
  arrested, and then eventually let go, and then, only after six weeks of round 
  ups were the four arrested who are now serving life sentences.  Indeed, 
  it was never proved who ordered the shooting of Haaf.  They tried to make 
  it Sharif but could not prove it.  Then they tried to make it the other 
  leaders of United for Peace leadership (Spike an the Rev. Jerry Mcaffee).  
  In the end, it was pinned only on low level gang members.  The System 
  has seethed for 13 years in its desire for a showcase trial with higher level 
  Black leaders, as if community activists, as per their statement, are community 
  leaders by day and gang leader by night. </p>
<p>This is the shot they have fired across the bow of th Black community.  
  This is how you tear apart a community.  Accuse them with innuendo.  
  Scare them.  And then round them up. </p>
<p>What do these two Strip pieces tell us?  They tell us that the wounds 
  of this incident are still festering among White Minneapolis. </p>
<p>More serious are the other messages of Widseth and Streitz, <strong>(1) </strong> 
  that there is a serious question of danger for those attempting to work to save 
  young men and women from the abyss of gang activity, as they are defined as 
  being gang members too; and (2) there is a clear implication that Spike and 
  others should have been indicted for aiding and abetting the murder of Haaf. 
   Why would they write such a thing?  If they spent, as they write, <strong>&quot;thousands of hours establishing the guilt of those charged,&quot; </strong>then 
  surely they know whether Spike and other should have been indicted or not.  
  Such innuendo achieves what they don&#8217;t want:  the same questioning about 
  the guilt of the second set of men arrested as well as the first. </p>
<p>Coming as this does on the heels of the stories of Reed and Clark, it creates 
  great reasons and anxiety for those trying to bring young people back from the 
  abyss of life in a gang.  They have purposefully attempted to raise doubt 
  in people&#8217;s minds about whether one can ever do the right thing to save and 
  preserve one&#8217;s community with the statement that City Inc was a criminal hub. 
   It raises the key question: what are the ground rules?  Why do 
  the consider those working with youth to be considered gang members too?  
  Could it be that they want the gang problem contained but not ended, so the 
  internal strife continues and Black on Black crime continues, saving them the 
  effort? </p>
<p>Is that what the letter of Tyrone Terrill is about, establishing ground rules, 
  that those so labeled, and their friends and families, are to be rounded up, 
  and that the labeling is not longer to be by whites but by the Blacks they have 
  appointed to paid positions?  We in Black America have worked in all circumstances 
  with our young, dealing with the emergency among our young people.  Are 
  we now to ask permission in our endeavers to serve young people and help them 
  save their lives if we are not to be labeled gang members too? </p>
<p>We are confused, as all Spike said was what many have expressed and believed, 
  and that is this:  it was not proven conclusively and beyond a reasonable 
  doubt who the real trigger man was, regardless of how many others were involved. 
</p>
<p>A lot want to forget. But how when it has been brought up again?  Recall 
  that the group of four convicted was not the original four arrested for the 
  murder. The first four were released.  The word on street at the time 
  was that they had been cooperating with police and  in return were allowed 
  to move a significant amount of drugs through the city. </p>
<p>And how were the final four determined?  Only after over 600 African 
  Americans were rounded up and detained over a period of six weeks after Jerry 
  Haaf was killed.  </p>
<p>We do not favor gangs.  And we do not write in support of Spike, but 
  rather in support of truth and justice.  We are now faced with the fact 
  that this has opened some very deep and dangerous wounds in this town.  
</p>
<p>So again we ask, what are the rules of engagement?  What is expected 
  as appropriate efforts of a community to save lives?  If we sit down in 
  a room with the young involved will we later be indicted?  </p>
<p>It is almost as if George Widseth and Robert Streitz have been waiting thirteen 
  years for this &#8220;opening&#8221; in order to seize the moment to make their charge. 
   They issue the warning that &#8220; Moss should be more concerned that he worked 
  alongside Sharif Willis, who was a &#8220;community leader&#8221; by day and a 
  Vice Lords gang leader by night.&#8221;  Let us look at their words again:  
  they spent &#8220;thousands of hours establishing the guilt of those charged.&#8221;  
  Then why don&#8217;t they know for sure about Spike?  And what do they know 
  for sure about Jerry Haaf, who, on a patrolman&#8217;s salary, lived in a $400 thousand 
  house (that today would be worth over $600,000), and had a big boat.  
  Inquiring minds want to know if that had anything to do with his death. </p>
<p>We are also curious as to why Widseth and Streitz ignore the reality of the 
  history of the time, that Sharif Willis, who had murdered a man seven years 
  earlier, was the darling of the white corporate community and released at the 
  urging of the White communty.  We suspect that they had a &#8220;noble savage&#8221; 
  view:  in the right environment, theirs, and under the right overseeing, 
  theirs, Blacks would be peaceful.  </p>
<p>Indeed, Widseth and Streitz fail to mention that Sharif Willis was such a darling 
  of White Minnesota that he was featured on the front page of the Wall Street 
  Journal in April 1991 (their on-line archive only goes back to 1996), and was 
  part of a Peace Summit that discussed the economic plan of Dick Gregory and 
  Louis Farakahn that was to be financed by Bill Cosby.  But with Officer 
  Haaf&#8217;s shooting, Sharif was no longer the darling of the White community.  
  They tried to pin the shooting on him. </p>
<p>So let us look again at the pre-Haaf shooting landscape.  The April Wall 
  Street Jouornal article celebrated the successful Peace Summit in Kansas City, 
  a four day conference heralded and supported by Russ Ewald, Nasby and Gen Mills. 
   What Widseth and Streitz don&#8217;t mention is that 100s of gang  members, 
  asian, bk, Hispanic, native amer were celebrated their too.  Next up were 
  Cleveland, Chicago and the West Coast.  </p>
<p>Then it was on to Cleveland and hopes for Chicago, maybe West coast (Hispanics 
  wanted), etc.  We were cut out of the Cleveland meeting, with Nabe an 
  McKnight labeling me too dangerous.  Apike and McAffee agreed to my being 
  cut out. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cleveland showed great promise.  People came from New York, 
  Boston, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., etc.  Louis Farakahn would provide 
  the marketing, Dick Gregory was going to supply the property and a factory in 
  San Fernando Valley to manufacture the clothes, and Bill Cosby was going to 
  finance the plan for $2 million.  Not realizing the significance of tossing 
  overboard the author of the plan, they found themselves unable to articulate 
  the plan and were told to bring us back in to explain it. </p>
<p>But Russ Ewald remained adament that we were dangerous.  Didn&#8217;t matter. 
   Haaf was killed.  Everything fell apart.  Spike&#8217;s program 
  was ended. </p>
<p>Haaf was just one man.  How could the white community become so unhinged 
  over the death of one when they yawned at the multiple deaths of young Black 
  men?  The Whites were angry.  They blamed Spike Moss and wanted 
  him on trial as well.  It would have been a show trial to rival those 
  of the USSR.  The whites didn&#8217;t mind as long as the Blacks were just moving 
  drugs among each other and killing each  other.  Then, &#8220;bang,&#8221; literally, 
  a white cop is killed and everything comes to a screeching halt.  The 
  same occurred when a white girl was later killed in Martin Luther King park. 
   Clearly, for the Strib, for Widseth and Streitz, and the white nice Minneapolis, 
  there is greater value by for white life than Black life.  </p>
<p>Sharif, the prince of success, heralded by White Minneapolis, was arrested 
  on a weapons charge and imprisoned for life as a 3 time loser&#8230;</p>
<p>We remain mystified why Doug Grow and his editors would re-open this door to 
  damnation, to let the four horseman of the racist apocalypse ride through.  
  This episode, along with Spike now asking for more money for yet another program, 
  underscores why our book&#8217;s chapter 14 on Black organizations (NAACP, Urban League, 
  city departments of human rights) is subtitled, &#8220;Black Organzations: Now Part 
  of the Problem Rather Than The Solution.&#8221;  It is why, in chapter 16, we 
  head the pages, &#8220;Unrest, Disturbance:  The Status Quo Price Minneapolis 
  is Willing to Pay.&#8221; </p>
<p>We, as Blacks, again get the blame.  And yet the real answer is jobs 
  for which first is required education, and yet the basic skils test scores reported 
  in the Star-Tribune shows that the gaps we reported in Chapter 7 of our book, 
  have increased, both in terms of Black-white student test scores and in terms 
  of between high scoring schools (predominantly White) and low scoring schools 
  (predominantly Black).  In our book we refer to it as &#8220;clubbing the cubs 
  into inferioiorty and helplessness.&#8221;  We call, instead, for &#8220;Stop the 
  clubbing and teach skills, optimism, and hope.&#8221;  This is not done. </p>
<p>The status qo for the city is maintained.  Blacks are blamed.  
  The gaps hold or increase.  All is well with the Minneapolis separatist 
  status quo.  Job hiring compliance rules are ignored.  The rules 
  for th education of Blacks is ignored.  The status quo wins.  Our 
  kids lose.  </p>
<p>Peace initiatives remain abandoned.  Blacks remain sequestered in the 
  inner city.  All is well and right with the White communities.<br>

<p><strong>6-14-2005, Blog/#62: Altitude and Attitude: Raising Up Black Student 
  Achievement Scores and Ignoring White Attempts to Put Down &#8220;Uppity&#8221; Blacks Who 
  Need To Be Shown Their &#8220;Place.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>In our Column of October 20, 2004, on several topics regarding the &#8220;Clouds 
  of justice&#8221; theme, one of the areas in which we had a question was of education: 
<blockquote>
  <p>Is the superintendent the next target? Why is the Minneapolis Public Schools 
    Board talking about going back on its contract with Superintendent? Dr. Thandiwe 
    Peebles (who is another person standing up for the community)? When will the 
    board join her in standing up for our kids? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On page 282 of our book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> we 
  quote Minneapolis Star Tribune columnist Doug Grow (emphasis added): 
<blockquote>
  <p>My simple answer for all of this is that Minneapolis leaders have failed&#8212;and 
    continue to fail&#8212;to create any sense of trust between civic institutions, 
    especially the Police Department, and large numbers of blacks in inner city 
    neighborhoods. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we were to change that a bit, and apply it to education and to race relations, 
  we would make it read as follows: 
<blockquote>
  <p>My simple answer for all of this is that Minneapolis leaders have failed&#8212;and 
    continue to fail&#8212;to create any sense of trust between civic institutions, 
    especially the Public Schools and large numbers of blacks in inner city neighborhoods. 
  </p>
  <p>My simple answer for all of this is that Minneapolis leaders have failed&#8212;and 
    continue to fail&#8212;to create any sense of trust between civic institutions, 
    especially the politicians (gerrymanderers) and business (taxes for education 
    avoiders) and large numbers of blacks in inner city neighborhoods. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his most recent column, of June 14, Doug notes how <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/465/5455427.html target="_blank">[Dr.] 
  Peebles&#8217; defenders raise tough questions.</a> Doug writes (emphasis added): 
<blockquote> 
  <p>We learn again that all by itself Minneapolis is a twin city. North <strong>and</strong> 
    south. Black <strong>and</strong> white. <strong>Members of the Board of Education</strong> who 
    publicly suggested on Sunday that Thandiwe Peebles perhaps should be replaced 
    as superintendent of Minneapolis schools clumsily <strong>have gouged open an old 
    wound</strong> between those two cities. Understand, <strong> [Dr.] Peebles, </strong> in 
    just one year on the job, <strong>has offended many who are not used to being offended. 
    </strong> She&#8217;s dissed principals, teachers, reporters, politicians and business 
    leaders. </p>
  <p> While upsetting some, Peebles clearly was building trust among a wide spectrum 
    of <strong>black leaders who for years have been saying the school district 
    has been failing black children. </strong> They say she has shown the ability 
    to improve the performances of some of the district&#8217;s most challenged schools. 
    Person after person spoke of how the board is bending to the pressure of a 
    few. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> Person after person spoke of how the board&#8217;s complaints are about Peebles&#8217; 
  style of leadership, not the substance of her leadership. Why bend to a few 
  whites? Is it because they want this &#8220;uppity&#8221; Black woman to get back into her 
  place, even if it means clubbing yet more of our Black cubs, driving them out 
  of the schools and into gangs? 
<p> In the June 13th Strib, we read<a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/1592/5453456.html target="_blank">[Dr.] 
  Peebles&#8217; job may be on the line.</a> 
<p> Then on the 14th, the Strib prints three stories, <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5454852.html target="_blank">[Dr.] 
  Peebles decision hangs fire while supporters fire up,</a> about the community 
  concern regarding how Dr. Peebles is being treated. The Strib then lists the 
  <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5455556.html target="_blank">Key 
  issues in [Dr.] Peebles case</a>, as it notes how <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5455578.html target="_blank">Board, 
  [Dr.] Peebles square off again.</a> Finally, Doug Grow weighs in on the controversy, 
  as noted above, with a piece titled <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/465/5455427.html target="_blank">Doug 
  Grow: [Dr.] Peebles&#8217; defenders raise tough questions.</a> 
<p>We are puzzled by those community leaders who claim to have been blindsided, 
  when, as noted above, we raised the issue in our column eight months ago. We 
  know these same &#8220;leaders&#8221; check (or have someone check for them) our weekly 
  column in the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, if for no other reason in the hopes 
  of catching us in a mistake (we continue to disappoint). The story leaked then 
  (and still circulating) was that Dr. Peebles had a conflict of interest with 
  a consultant. In reality, neither knew each other. This was to discredit her 
  as efforts were made, as some have suggested, to pave the way for the return 
  of David Jennings. These innuendoes leading to race polarization were carried 
  into the community through the reporting of Steve Brandt. This not to put a 
  knock on Steve. He just carries the water of the Strib editors. 
<p>Don Samuels, carrying the DFL water, remains understandably quiet, as the DFL 
  seeks to placate the White parents and the DFL teachers union. We have covered 
  this in Chapter 7 of our book, &#8220;The Corrupt and Racist Education system,&#8221; in 
  which we discussed how &#8220;Minneapolis continues to maintain poor schools for poor 
  kids in order to keep them poor,&#8221; and thus &#8220;club the Black cubs into inferiority 
  and helplessness rather than teach skills, optimism, and hope.&#8221; 
<p>Is it any wonder some of them feel there is no hope, and turn to gang membership 
  and criminal activities as they don&#8217;t feel they are allowed to be a part of 
  our community? If Tyrone Terrill and others would write an open letter to all 
  the so-called educators about the sorry state of education and the need to really 
  and truly educate our young, there would be a much better response in curbing 
  gangs. 
<p>As Natalie Johnson Lee points out, the whites have a problem with Dr. Peebles&#8217; &#8220;attitude.&#8221; When you have principals and teachers and the DFL all dragging their 
  feet fighting reform (testing, accountability for kids not learning, and sabotaging 
  minorities&#8217; alternatives to get out of the mediocre sorry state of the Minneapolis 
  Public Schools with charter schools and vouchers), we can only conclude that 
  Dr. Peebles was getting too close to bar-b-q-ing the educational establishment&#8217;s 
  sacred cows. They are feeling the heat. If I was among that recalcitrant, hold 
  down the Black students principals and teachers, I&#8217;d feel the fear of Dr. Peebles 
  too. We are told by reporter Brandt that they &#8220;fear retribution.&#8221; This smear 
  against Dr. Peebles is understandable. It is the Strib line. But ask yourself, 
  why do they fear being held accountable? Do the good white parents of the white 
  schools on the South side fear there will be an integration involving the Black 
  students from the North side? 
<p>Again the smear from Brandt: &#8220;Some principles lived in fear of [Dr.] Peebles&#8217; 
  visit to their school.&#8221; Why? If you were a principal doing your job, wouldn&#8217;t 
  you be proud of your efforts and want to show them off? What have they to hide? 
  When subordinates fear superiors it is often because they are not doing their 
  jobs (again, see Chapter 7 of my book). 
<p>Where are the leaders standing up for our kids? Thankfully, Rev. Ian Bethel 
  (who also chairs the Police Community Relations Committee) and 5th Ward Council 
  Member Natalie Johnson Lee, are standing up for our kids. We need more. How 
  about the Mayor and the Governor? 
<p>As Rev. Bethel said: &#8220;[Dr. Peebles&#8217;] leadership style is what attracted the 
  school board to bring her here,&#8221; as he assured one and all that Black leaders 
  would rally around Dr. Peebles. 
<p>As CM Natalie Johnson Lee said: 
<ul>
  <li>Why did you hire her? They told me that they hired her, not only because 
    she was qualified, [but because] she had a proven track record of what she 
    could do and how she could deliver it. The challenge is now that she is rising 
    to her qualifications and demonstrating that she could prove, what is the 
    problem? </li>
  <li>Many of you know, when someone cannot get us any other way, it becomes, 
    &#8220;The Attitude.&#8221; We have personality differences. </li>
  <li>Well, get over it. Our children need someone with her personality to move 
    an agenda for them and you need to be clear that we are not taking this sitting 
    down&#8230;</li>
  <li>This is not a joke, we are not playing. We are serious about the education 
    of our children and we believe she is the one we need right now to move our 
    children&#8217;s agenda forward. </li>
  <li>If you&#8217;re ready for a fight [Johnson warned the board] bring it on! 
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Even<a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5454852.html target="_blank"> 
  Brandt </a>admits that in her first year on the job, Peebles has alienated some 
  parents, teachers and principals with what they describe as an intimidating 
  top-down style. But she has also taken control of the worst scoring schools, 
  and the first set of test results to be released for her watch showed marked 
  improvement in basic-skills tests for eighth-graders. 
<p> Brandt goes on to admit that Dr. Peebles&#8217; &#8220;reputation for turning around troubled 
  schools, both in Cleveland and in New York city&#8221; is why &#8220;Board members said 
  they chose her.&#8221; We must then conclude that they really didn&#8217;t expect her to 
  be successful. 
<p> When Brandt lists <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5455556.html target="_blank">Key 
  issues in [Dr.] Peebles&#8217; case</a>, he admits &#8220;she was brought in to shake things 
  up and she&#8217;s doing that&#8221; and he then goes on to write &#8220;she was brought in to 
  address the achievement of poor and minority students and she&#8217;s doing that,&#8221; 
  and &#8220;the first test results released on her watch showed marked improvement.&#8221; 
  That is three accomplishments. To us that means three strikes against the board. 
  We thus are at a loss to explain the opposition to her other than the ugly head 
  of racism making itself known: that she is being &#8220;uppity&#8221; and has &#8220;attitude,&#8221; 
  all code words for not knowing her place among her white betters. What else 
  could it be? 
<p> That she has an &#8220;intimidating top down style&#8221; is another code phrase for being 
  uppity, having attitude, not knowing her place among her betters. 
<p> Here is the sad, tragic joke. The principles and teachers want collaboration 
  with the Superintendent, another code word for letting others know that no one 
  is going to tell them what to do, that they want a veto, EVEN THOUGH they have 
  done a LOUSY job with minorities for DECADES (again, see the stats in my Chapter 
  7 on Education). 
<p> The real howler, though, is Brandt carrying the old saw about how the Board 
  questions whether Dr. Peebles can &#8220;turn around [her] shortcomings&#8221; when they 
  refuse to address their own shortcomings. The Board complains about the spec 
  in Dr. Peeble&#8217;s eyes yet cannot see the logs in their own. 
<p> Why does the Board think we are stupid? Superintendents direct, the way CEOs 
  do. They are not the chief operating officers. Others do that. Principals are 
  supposed to be managing and communicating in their schools. If there is a management 
  problem it is due to internal sabotage. The teachers unions are opposed to change. 
  Principals are all former teachers. It is a closed loop. Our kids suffer because 
  of it. If they can keep the revolving door of Superindendents going they can 
  stall any real change until their retirement. 
<p> Dr. Peebles stated very clearly what is at stake: &#8220;we have the next generation 
  to save.&#8221; 
<p>We see clearly in Chapter 7 of my book how the school system has clubbed our 
  cubs. The Black community has too long stood idly by while the white community 
  stews about Blacks actually getting educated, and grouses because it is an uppity 
  Black woman with attitude that is starting to achieve what so many have sabotaged 
  and prevented for all too long. 
<p> The Black community must stand up and not budge in the single minded goal 
  of getting the schools to stop failing to educate our kids. As Nellie Stone 
  Johnson always said, &#8220;No education, no jobs, no housing.&#8221; 
<p> pp. 2, 33, 293, and, p. 269: James Baldwin: &#8220;The big secret that all Black 
  people know is that the machinery of our country&#8217;s operations are to keep the 
  Ni**er in his place.&#8221; 
<blockquote>
  <p>Minneapolis is like the last outpost of a great experiment in how to be a 
    model to the rest of the country on how to keep Black people in their place 
    (remember that was what James Baldwin said was the &#8220;big secret&#8221; that all Black 
    people knew: that &#8220;the machinery of the country&#8217;s operations were to keep 
    the Ni**er in his place&#8221;). Minneapolis has mastered the art of doing so. Baldwin 
    also said that if you really want to know what the White power structure really 
    wanted for Blacks, just look at what they did to Indians. Too many White folks 
    in Minneapolis, as well as nationwide, accept this. That makes it easier for 
    them to go along with the exclusion of non-Whites from education, housing, 
    and economic development. <br>

<p><strong><a name="0561b0604"></a>6-4-2005/#61: Dred Scott haunts The Twin Cities: The Ghost of Judge 
  Tawny watches to see if his ruling will be brought back to life, reminding us 
  again of the power of the courts. Is the DFL trying to bring back Chief Justice 
  Tawny? </strong> 
<p>Why won&#8217;t Chuck Wexler and the General Mills Foundation, Tyrone and Randy, 
  RT and Jayne, Tim and Norm address the solutions at the top of the page? We 
  all want to solve the problem of gangs. Those solutions provide a great beginning 
  for doing so. 
<p>In our book, <a href=http://www.beacononthehill.com, target="_blank"> The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes </a> Interlude 6, &#8220;Dred Scott at Fort Snelling: The Kind 
  of &#8216;Being First&#8217; We don&#8217;t Want,&#8221; p. 117-118, refers to a dark side of our history. 
  Now it would seem that some Blacks have signed on with Whites &#8220;to be first&#8221; 
  in our Twin City community to &#8220;take down&#8221; our young men and their families and 
  friends, as is proposed in St. Paul. We are among those concerned about what 
  Chuck Wexler, Executive Director of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) 
  is up to. In this age of Star Wars III, &#8220;The Revenge of the Sith,&#8221; we wonder 
  why so many are approaching our young men from what would appear to be the dark 
  side. That is the wrong force. The force of light from a beacon of hope is needed, 
  and is listed at the top of this page. 
<p>We have addressed St. Paul&#8217;s Human Rights Department Director Tyrone Terrill&#8217;s 
  Open Letter to the community in earlier columns (May 4 and 18, June 1) and web 
  log entries (47-48, 51, 53-55, 59-60). Our Open Letter to Tyrone is Web log 
  entry #51. 
<p>We believe there are clear <strong>links</strong> between <strong> (1) </strong> the April &#8220;open 
  letter&#8221; of Tyrone Terrill, <strong> (2) </strong> his June 1st deadline to gang members 
  to stop gang banging and their their families and friends must stop supporting 
  them or they will all suffer the consequences, <strong> (3) </strong> Chuck Wexler&#8217;s work 
  with the Genreal Mills Foundation, <strong> (4) </strong> the ignoring of the Federal 
  mediation established group, the PCRC (Police Community Relations Committee), 
  and <strong> (5) </strong> St. Paul Mayor Randy Kelly launching &#8220;Operation CARE&#8221; June 
  1st (<strong>C</strong>omprehensive <strong>A</strong>rea <strong>R</strong>eclamaiton <strong>E</strong>nterprise). 
  <strong> &#8220;Links&#8221; </strong> as in close coordination between Chuck, Tyrone, and Randy (and, 
  we suspect, Governor Tiim Palenty and Senator Norm Coleman). Thus we applaud 
  Nathaniel Khaliq, head of St. Paul&#8217;s NAACP, for stepping up to challenge them 
  and ask the right questions about what they are about. 
<p>We are discussing what all the Twin Cities are talking about: Tyrone Terrill&#8217;s &#8220;open letter&#8221; to the Blacks of St. Paul, informing them that he considered Black 
  gang members &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and that friends and family that support them are 
  complicit with them, and thus all of them would face the &#8220;consequences&#8221; if they 
  didn&#8217;t&#8217; cease gang acitivites by June 1st. And Mayor Randy launched Operation 
  CARE June 1st. 
<p>Let us be clear on four things. 
<p><strong>First, </strong> none of us are in favor of &#8220;gang bangers.&#8221; None of us favor 
  or support illegal gang activities or actions that intimidate members of the 
  community or in any other way create a reduction in the quality of life or the 
  sense of safety in the neighborhood due to overt actions or due to fear caused 
  by covert acts. 
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the debate is not over whether or not to allow gang 
  members to run rampant. No one wants that. The debate is over <strong> (1) </strong> 
  who should be considered gang members, <strong> (2) </strong> how should they 
  be dealt with, and <strong> (3) </strong> how should we solve the overall problems 
  of our inner city neighborhoods. As for #3, it is simple, from our humble perspective: 
  follow the suggestions in our book (summarized in Chapter 17) and the papers 
  in our <a href= ../../tocsolutions.htm> Solutions </a> section of our web site, especially <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm"> 
  The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together </a> 
  and <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The Seven Solution 
  Areas</a> 
<p><strong>Thirdly, </strong> we stand shoulder to shoulder with St. Paul&#8217;s human rights 
  director Tyrone Terrill in wanting to see a cessation of gang activities and 
  turn them into solid, productive citizens. However, we break ranks on his definitions 
  and on his plans for how to do so. We disagree with his negative police model 
  social engineering. We disagree with the notion that you have to become a devil 
  to beat a devil. We believe the links above will do a better job than either 
  Tyrone&#8217;s &#8220;tough love&#8221; for terrorists model or Chuck&#8217;s Patriot Act terrorist 
  model. 
<p><strong>Fourthly, </strong> from our perspective, none of us are saying gang activity 
  is the result of some kind of victimhood. Conscious decisions have been made. 
  Everyone knows better. But we have to stop making it easier for them to make 
  that decision by ending the &#8220;redlining&#8221; that still goes on in the areas of education, 
  jobs, and housing (see my book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i>< 
  Chapters 7, 8 and 9). Some make the judgment that, given such &#8220;redlining,&#8221; the 
  decision is rational. We want to end the &#8220;redlining&#8221; in education, jobs, and 
  housing so that such a decision will no longer seem rational to our young Black 
  men. 
<p>Back to the ghost of <a href= http://www.historicaldocuments.com target="_blank" >Dred 
  Scott, </a> who was a Black slave who sued for his freedom in 1847, on the basis 
  that the 1820 <a href= http://www.historicaldocuments.com/MissouriCompromise.htm target="_blank"
>Missouri Compromise</a> defined him a free man as he had been in a free state 
  (Illinois). The Supreme Court ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional 
  because it deprived a person (slave owner) of his or her property (slave) without 
  due process of law. Don&#8217;t you just love great moral issues being decided on 
  such technicalities? Just like in St. Paul today. 
<p>And the Supreme Court then, knowing the nation was divided, knowing that both 
  the Constitution and the Missouri Compromises were attempts to maintain a slave 
  state/free state balance until the decision would be made one way or the other 
  by the people, decided to make it for them. Claiming to follow the <a href= http://www.usconstitution.com target="_blank"> 
  Constitution </a> the Supreme Court essentially amended the constitution by 
  itself by (a) claiming that as Negroes were not &#8220;citizens&#8221; (as stated in the 
  Constitution), they did not have the right to sue in any federal court, and 
  (b) to support that claim, had to rule the Missouri Compromise (keeping a balance 
  in the number of free states/slave states) as unconstitutional, thus essentially 
  ending the debate and paving the way for the nation to become all slave state 
  nation. This unleashed the abolitionists, especially John Brown, who then forced 
  the issue in order to cause the Civil War that they felt was the only way to 
  end slavery once and for all. 
<p>Tyrone Terill is replaying the history of that time, playing the role of Chief 
  Justice Tawny by denying the absoluteness of our civil and constitutional rights. 
  He raised his notion up the flag pole to see who would salute: that those who 
  continued in gangs and gang activity (including their family and friends) would 
  be considered to be &#8220;throwing away your civil rights.&#8221; Gang members/friends/families 
  all become Dred Scotts, Tyrone has become Judge Tawny, and Chuck, Randy, Norm 
  and Tim are his assistant judges as they have not disagreed one wit to this 
  public official&#8217;s stance. They are all saluting the flag that these &#8220;types&#8221; 
  of Blacks have no civil rights. If the hair on your back isn&#8217;t standing on end 
  and if a shiver isn&#8217;t going up your spine, you too must be saluting this flag 
  denying civil and constitutional rights on the personal whim of officials. 
<p>Having been a slave, Dred Scott had not been allowed to learn to read and write. 
  This is the same today in our inner city schools where the powers (coalition 
  of DFL teachers, DFL unions, DFL school systems, and DFL city bureaus) have 
  given us a system that blocks too many of our Black sons and daughters from 
  being able to read and write (or how else to you explain the statistics in my 
  book&#8217;s Chapter 7 on Education?), greatly reducing their options. Too many, as 
  a result, incorrectly conclude they are perceived as having no value to society 
  and choose gangs. These baby seals have been clubbed in our schools. Some choose 
  to club back. 
<p>Today we read many things about Supreme Court appointees. The court has been 
  re-politicized (or maybe its always has been, although life time tenure was 
  to prevent it). 
<p>Look at the Supreme Court that made the Dred Scott decision: Seven had been 
  appointed by pro-slavery presidents from the South and of these, five were from 
  slave-holding families. The court&#8217;s decision was written by <a href="http://www.historicaldocuments.com/DreadScott.htm#RogerBrookeTaney
" target="_blank">Chief Justice Roger Brook Tawney</a> The Western territories 
  were not yet states. If they could now become slave, the balance would be tipped 
  and the culture, mores, and morals of the South would prevail. Given the wages 
  differential between slave states/free states, the fear was that all states 
  would then eventually become slave states to be competitive. 
<p>The deal made with he devil in 1776 and again in 1820, that allowed Whites 
  only to be free was now placing whites in danger too. Once slavery was universal, 
  why not poor Whites too? The rush to the cauldron of civil war commenced. 
<p>In our book we talk about the war on young Black men (see Chapter 9) that is 
  creating a <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth.</a> Part of that, needless to say, deals with 
  decisions to join gangs and engage in gang banging acivities. And now this war 
  against our young Black men is being led by the two Black Civil Rights Directors 
  in the Twin Cities, St. Paul&#8217;s Director, Tyrone Terrill, by openly calling for 
  it in his &#8220;open letter&#8221; and Minneapolis&#8217; Director, Jayne Khalifa, who gives 
  her assent by remaining silent and not speaking up as her counter part in St. 
  Paul goes against what both of them are to help protect: the civil rights of 
  all, especially of minorities. We read nothing from her. Her silence condemns 
  her. And who else is in this assent of silence? The Mayor RT Ryback of Minneapolis 
  and Mayor Randy Kelly of St. Paul, Governor Tim Pawlenty, Senators Norm Coleman 
  and Mark Dayton, the General Mills Foundation, and Chuck Wexler and the Police 
  Executive Research Forum. 
<p>On page 118 of our book, we wrote, &#8220;The &#8216;shocks and throes and convulsions&#8217; 
  felt then [1850s] about the Dred Scott case regarding slavery are felt now in 
  the Minneapolis Black Community in the redistricting case. We will not accept 
  being treated as Dred Scots.&#8221; This is why we stand up to St. Paul and urge the 
  city to seek other ways: turn out Blacks that can read and write (<i>The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes,</i> Chapter 7), allow hiring on jobs and in contracting 
  (<i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> Chapter 9), and allow affordable 
  housing rather than gentrification of former Black homes for Whites (<i>The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> Chapter 8). 
<p>People ask how can such injustice exist. As Supreme Court Tawney wrote, &#8220;It 
  is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or injustice,&#8221; as 
  they defer to the Constitution and law makers, and yet the Court went ahead 
  and declared the work of lawmakers, the Missouri Compromise, unconstitutional 
  such that they, the Court, could then continue a situation of injustice for 
  slaves and Blacks everywhere, and then essentially took it upon themselves to 
  make the new law allowing slavery elsewhere, ignoring legislation and law makers. 
  This is the same kind of court as law makers debate that exists today. 
<p>We see all of this &#8220;definitional&#8221; work going on as we review the stories under 
  the recent headlines in the Star Tribune of Minneapolis and the Pioneer Press 
  of St. Paul (discussing the debate that continues over Tyrone&#8217;s open letter 
  in April. We understand why W.E.B. DuBois said, <a href=http://www.ncsociology.org/sociationtoday/v31/smith.htm target="_blank"> &#8220;The &#8220;Negro&#8221; is the clown of anthropology and football of politics.&#8221;</a> What 
  we don&#8217;t understand is why our two Directors of Human Rights are not standing 
  up against this in the Twin Cities, and why their mayors and the Governor don&#8217;t 
  either. Nor do we understand why Black leaders are putting up with it. This 
  is not a trend that bodes well for America, Black or White. The headlines tell 
  the story: 
<p>The Strib, June 2nd, noted in Curt Brown&#8217;s story <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5434048.html target="_blank" 
> St. Paul beefs up patrols in &#8216;hot spots&#8217;</a> that 
<p>The Pioneer Press, June 3rd, noted June in Robert Ingrassia&#8217;s story that <a href=http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/local/11801581.htm target="_blank"> 
  City official calls gang activity &#8216;terrorist acts&#8217;</a> and that this official, 
  Tyrone Terrill, &#8220;stood by his letter.&#8221; 
<p>Then on June 4th, the Pioneer Press finally reported on the &#8220;hot spot&#8221; plan 
  in the Tim Nelson story <a href=http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/local/11811466.htm target="_blank"> 
  Some in &#8216;hot spots&#8217; cool to city plan</a> The &#8220;cool to city plan&#8221; of treating 
  us as football clowns, is also reported in the June 4th Strib in Jackie Crosby&#8217;s 
  story, <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5439097.html target="_blank"> 
  NAACP criticizes city official&#8217;s letter.</a> The criticism came from Nathaniel 
  Khaliq, head of the St. Paul NAACP, who spoke truth to power when he said that 
  St. Paul was engaging in a discriminatory policy that targets Black gang members. 
<p>Is the city being discriminatory? Of course. If not, why do Terrill and Randy 
  focus on Black gang members and not gangs comprised of Asians, Mexicans, Somalis, 
  Native Americans, etc. Or is mentioning them against the politically correct 
  multicultural canon? From our perspective, we see one Trojan Horse after another 
  being rolled into our neighborhoods in the name of public safety. We don&#8217;t need 
  Trojan horses. We just need education that educates, job sites that hire, and 
  housing that is affordable. 
<p>This development in St. Paul is not new to us. Our book&#8217;s discussion of the 
  Federal Mediation Process (Chapter 16) noted that in terms of unrest and disturbances, 
  unrest and disturbances were the status quo price Minneapolis was willing to 
  pay. As Doug Grow wrote (quoted on page 284 of <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes</i>), &#8220;My simple answer for all of this is that Minneapolis leaders 
  have failed&#8212;and continue to fail&#8212;to create any sense of trust between civic 
  institutions, especially the Police Department, and large numbers of blacks 
  in inner city neighborhoods.&#8221; We can now say that this applies equally to St. 
  Paul as well. 
<p>And what is the &#8220;answer&#8221; we are given? As a result of the 9 months of Federal 
  mediation, a PCRC was formed: Police Community Review Committee. But it is ignored. 
  Instead, we are given Chuck Wexler, paid for by the General Mills Foundation, 
  working with the police without discussion with us. It is almost as if the plans 
  we have been exposing in our columns have momentarily been shifted to St. Paul. 
  Why? Because until Khaliq spoke up no one else in St. Paul had bothered to. 
<p>We see that both the Dred Scott decision and the Tyrone Terrill letter and 
  the St. Paul Operation CARE are all color blind: blind to the realities of people 
  of color in the community. 
<p>In the same way the Jewish capos in the German concentration camps were able 
  to justify how they treated their fellow Jews, we see the same now in the Twin 
  Cities with so-called Black leaders rationalizing their treatment of their fellow 
  Blacks, as if all of our kids are thugs and those related to them are thugs. 
<p>As noted above, we have dealt with this in our columns and Web Logs entries 
  (columns of May 4 and 18, June 1, and web log entries 47-48, 51, 53-55, and 
  59-60. Our Open Letter to Tyrone is Web log entry #51. We discussed the possibility 
  of certain areas being quarantined (and now that has happened to a degree with 
  the tarketing of a specific 225 block area in St. Paul). And now Project CARE 
  is sending in inspectors that can evict through condemnation, another way to 
  begin a round up. They can condemn property to force people out of neighborhoods. 
  This could be applied to any they think are gang bangers or their supporters, 
  family and friends. Hard core police could even claim White friends and supporters 
  are to be included. As one professional basketball team official said, in their 
  attempts to plug leaks to the press, said that he they had to fire ten innocents 
  to get to the guilty party they would. So what happens to those Tyrone and Randy 
  label as thugs? Do they get sent to camps? That was what was in earlier plans. 
  We keep asking what is in the plan. No one will say. 
<p>So why PERF (Police Executive Research Forum)? According to the <a href= http://policeforum.mn-8.net target="_blank"> 
  PERF web site, </a> PERF is an organization dedicated to <i>improving policing 
  and advancing professionalism through research, public policy debate, provision 
  of management services and executive development training, and publishing. </i> 
<p>That&#8217;s fine. But they are to improve policing, not education, jobs or housing. 
  Who is going to improve education, job hiring, and housing availability and 
  affordability? 
<p>PERF has a site dealing with <a href= http://policeforum.mn-8.net/default.asp?link= target="_blank"
> terrorism</a>. Is this where Tyrone gets the term? They have a series called &#8220;Protecting Your Community from Terrorism: Strategies for Local Law Enforcement.&#8221; 
  Guess what Volume Two is? It is <a href= http://policeforum.mn-8.net/default.asp?link=%2Fdocs%2Fdocapp%2Easpx%3F%5Fcommand%3Ddetail%26%5Fappid%3D5%26id%3D36306%26%5FclientInfo%3D%253cclientInfo%253e%253cfid%253e%2D1%253c%252ffid%253e%253c%252fclientInfo%253e target="_blank"> 
  Working with Diverse Communities</a> PERF then says this volume discusses how &#8220;to protect against future terrorist attacks, prevent backlash violence against 
  vulnerable groups, and sensitize officers to cultural issues that can affect 
  interviewing and information sharing. It also addresses such issues as perceptions 
  of racial profiling and the local law enforcement role in immigration enforcement.&#8221; 
<p>Is it Chuck, then, that is giving Tyrone the notion to call young Black gang 
  members terrorists? 
<p>In this PERF volume two, on page 35, we read that &#8220;every officer can&#8217;t understand 
  every nuance of every culture of every community,&#8221; so we are again left with 
  the question: why isn&#8217;t the PCRC being involved to help them understand the 
  nuances? So why, after admitting that &#8220;Law enforcement leaders don&#8217;t know how 
  valuable community leaders are to the policing effort,&#8221; does the PERF man in 
  town, Chuck Wexler, ignore the PCRC? Who better to give an outsider the nuances 
  and how to understand them? 
<p>On page 37 we read, &#8220;Diverse community leaders and law enforcement executives 
  must commit to the same goals: to rid communities of terrorists&#8230;&#8221; 
  Again, is this why Tyrone uses this term? 
<p>Page 38 says &#8220;the road to cooperation&#8221; is through &#8220;forums or councils.&#8221; So, 
  given that we have the federally mediated PCRC, why are we not included? Again 
  on p. 38: &#8220;Multiculural forums and councils are used in several communities 
  to open a dialogue between law enforcement officials and community members.&#8221; 
  So why not us at PCRC? 
<p>On page 41 we read a statement by the Chicago chief about how much they have 
  learned &#8220;to show special sensitivity&#8230; on the religion and associative 
  customs of Islam, Judaism&#8230;Hinduism and Buddhism&#8230;providing officers 
  with the tools to build and strengthen police and community relationships through 
  a better understanding of the people they serve.&#8221; Why not the same approach 
  with Blacks in general and gang members in particular? 
<p>On page 48 we may have the key statement, so key that we wonder if this is 
  what has PERF riding Tyrone and why he has said what he has said: &#8220;We have too 
  much to lose to have terrorists come from within our community.&#8221; 
<p>And as p. 48 declares &#8220;the community is a source of information,&#8221; why do the 
  powers at be continue to attempt to bypass the community information group par 
  excellence, the PCRC? 
<p>Surely Chuck Wexler should know all of this, as he is the Executive Director. 
  Just as the Jack Nicholson character in &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221; knew, Chuck knows.

  Act </a> to down load not only the Patriot Act itself, but ten articles about 
  it as well as a link page to more articles about the act. 
<p>Our concern is what is in the Plan that Chuck and Tyrone, Randy, Tim, Norm 
  and Mark have cooked up for St. Paul (not to mention RT and Jayne for Minneapolis). 
<p> Gangs committing crimes, harassing and intimidating neighbors, flauting the 
  law, spreading drugs to our kids, abusing our daughters, leading our sons into 
  crime, all need to be dealt with. We recommended the &#8220;how&#8221; method be based on 
  the guilty individuals, not the innocenet tribe or community of which they are 
  a part. 
<p> What model will be used, the tribal all are guilty Arthur Anderson model or 
  the individuals who are guilty are rounded up model used with HealthSouth, WorldCom, 
  Tyco, Adelphia, Marsh & McLennan, AIG, RiteAid, Dynergy, etc.? 
<p> Arthur Anderson was the auditing firm for Enron. When Enron, the Houston white 
  collar gangbanger was found guilty of billions of dollars worth of white collar 
  crime (fraud, cooking the books, submittting false reports, embezzling billions 
  of dollars), the government went after its biggest friend, Arthur Anderson. 
  Probably 98% of Arthur Anderson&#8217;s nearly 20,000 employees had nothing to do 
  with Enron or any other scandal. But the government rounded them all up under 
  a single indictment. They all lost their jobs. Guilt by association. The tribe 
  was destroyed for the sins of a few leaders. Should the few pirates running 
  some corporations be put in jail? You bet. Should all of their innocent employees 
  be made to suffer too? No. But that is what Tyrone and Chuck and Randy and the 
  rest are saying about those innocents who are relatives or friends of guilty 
  gang bangers. 
<p> The model example we recommend is the individual model, not the tribal model 
  (&#8221;How to Exorcise a Corporate Scandal,&#8221; WSJ, 6-4-05, p. B1). During the Inquisition 
  and other examples of our past when we worked from the dark side: guilt by association: 
  any heretic deemed guilty resulted in the whole village being punished too. 
  That is what was done with Arthur Anderson. We recommend going after only the 
  guilty and then proscecuting them to the fullest extent of the law: jail time, 
  fines, community service, etc. This is the model being used for HealthSouth, 
  Worldcom, Tyco, Adelphia, Marsh & McLennon, AIG, RiteAid, Dynergy, etc: indicting 
  and taking to court the actual evil doers (the few, e.g., who engineered HealthSouth&#8217;s 
  $2.7 billion fraud, WorldCom&#8217;s $11 billion fraud, the family that headed Adelphia 
  and the billions they looted, the lavish personal spending at the expense of 
  their &#8220;corporate community&#8221;: employees, shareholders, and taxing entities where 
  they were located or where they did business, etc.). 
<p>All the key top managers of these companies pay with their jobs when the companies 
  are then bought out by others, as has occurred with WorldCom, Adelphia, and 
  others. You can get a look at the cases/charges <a href=http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB110995911259970823,00.html?mod=2_1040_3 target="_blank">here</a>

<p>Just as corporate and government workers often don&#8217;t speak up out of fear of 
  retaliation and intimidation or from fear of losing their jobs (hence whistleblower 
  laws, immunity, new identities, etc.), so too do community members and even 
  relatives hesitate to come forward out of fear of retaliation. 
<p>During the roaring 20s of Chicago (not to mention St. Paul), the police knew 
  who the crooks were (al Capone in Chicago, John Dillenger in St. Paul), but 
  too many were on the take looking the other way. Hence, in Chicago, the need 
  for &#8220;The Untouchables,&#8221; law enforcement officials that were not corruptible. 
  If there are plans for roundups, that means our officials know who the guilty 
  parties are. We recognize the problem of the revolving door, arresting gang 
  bangers and then turning them loose. But that is not the fault of the neighborhood: 
  it is the fault of a corrupt criminal &#8220;justice&#8221; system that now want to make 
  the community pay for its own idiotic system. You can&#8217;t have ACLU sensitivities 
  toward the feelings of minorities on one day, and let them off, and then turn 
  around and get angry at their behavior and blame their community, friends and 
  relatives. 
<p> We have already listed our solutions. What we don&#8217;t understand, besides the 
  ignoring of the PCRC, is the ignoring of these solution suggestions. So, let&#8217;s 
  list them again, from the top of this page. Very simply put, to solve the gang 
  problem, start with closing the gaps: 
<blockquote> 
  <p>&#8230; the Black gaps in education, jobs, housing; the State of Emergency 
    for Black inner city Youth; the obstructing of equal access and equal opportunity 
    for minorities; and searching solutions through the use of the Golden Rule 
    (Book&#8217;s Chapter 5), the use of The Minneapolis Building Blocks and The 
    Seven Key Solutions to create fairness, justice, and reconciliation so that 
    all can acquire assets and build wealth. We can do so implementing the four 
    freedoms,&#8221; articulated in the 1-11-44 State of the Union speech, in 
    which the freedoms of speech and of religion and the freedoms from want and 
    from fear would be freedoms for everyone in this country and for everyone 
    &#8220;everywhere in the world,&#8221; offering Higher Hopes For Youth Than 
    Hip Hop by, together, working to reduce violence in our schools and communities. 
  </p>

<p>Why won&#8217;t Chuck, and the General Mills Foundation, Randy and Tyrone, RT and 
  Jayne, Norm, Mark, and Tim consider and address these?
