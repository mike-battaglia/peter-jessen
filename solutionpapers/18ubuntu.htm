<p> <strong>#163. Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu's "Ubuntu Theology of Reconciliation, 
  " Part 1 of 3 [</strong>Wednesday, October 1, 2003<strong>] </strong> 
<p> In Chapter 14 of my book, "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes," I touch 
  briefly on the experience <strong>Nellie Stone Johnson</strong> and I had with <strong> Archbishop 
  Desmond Tutu of South Africa,</strong> back in the 80s. The title of Archbishop Tutu's 
  book, <strong>No Future Without Forgiveness</strong> as well as his work on South Africa's 
  <strong>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</strong> have many good things to say to us 
  that relate directly to the current firestorms in Minneapolis, and, in particular 
  the one regarding the firestorm over the appointment of Superintendent of the 
  Minneapolis Public Schools. <strong>Once again, we have been diverted by old hatreds 
  of yesterday that prevent us from doing good today so that we can't create the 
  future we want. </strong> Our topic should be how poorly Minneapolis (and every other 
  city in this country) educates inner city Black kids. That the NAACP has backed 
  the appointment is really not the issue (it has long stood for the status quo 
  and going along with the Masters in their big house as it stays away as much 
  as possible from the fields). <strong>The issue is the fact that the NAACP hasn't 
  stood up to the district as a whole over its poor perfomance with Black kids, 
  </strong> especially during the tenures of Black superintendents. The man the board 
  wants once opposed making Martin Luther King's birthday as a national holiday 
  (but so did President Jimmy Carter, and thus it was that it was Ronald Reagan 
  who signed it into law). He was also opposed to divestiture as the way to fight 
  apartheid in South Africa (which was also the position of the University of 
  Minnesota and many in the DFL, so he again was in a large company). I am nervous 
  when we hold specific views of the past against people selectively, as some 
  are held up and others are given a pass. 
<p> This needs to stop. Why? Because our kids are the ones who pay for the hatreds 
  of their parents. And don't forget that even though the Repubicans get the blame 
  for the flag of the Confederacy flying over the Capitol of South Carolina, it 
  was a Democratic Governor, Fritz Holllings, who put it up there (incidentally, 
  I like Hollings current web site slogan: "Performance is better than promise" 
  and recommend we apply it to the MPS). And I don't hear any in the Black community 
  taking Senator Robert Byrd to task for his past membership in the Ku Klux Klan 
  nor for his recent use of the "N" word.
<p> Earlier I talked about the need to use <strong>specific tools of conflict 
  resolution, </strong> of which a list is on my web site in the paper on "Conflict 
  Resolutions Models" posted in June 2003. We have just added two more, including 
  the model used by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. As I explain in my book (Chapter 
  14) <strong>Nellie Stone Johnson and I had several telephone conversations with 
  Archbishop Tutu. </strong> We were going to bring him to the campus of the University 
  of Minnesota. Tutu urged divestiture (to fight apartheid by selling stocks of 
  companies that do business in South Africa). Nellie and I supported that. Others 
  felt it would delay not hasten the end of apartheid. And just as there was White 
  fear and Black anger in South Africa, we had them here too (still have them 
  in Minneapolis). We also talked with the journalist Eric Duma. Their phones 
  were tapped. The government of South Africa called the U.S. which in turn called 
  the University of Minnesota. The University Board of Governors had refused to 
  apply sanctions. The university denied our request to have Tutu speak at the 
  University. Read about it in my book: p. 222: <strong>"Local officials, public 
  and private, didn't want Bishop Tutu because&#8230;they didn't want a campus 
  movement in favor of disinvestments when the University had already determined 
  it would not divest nor favor divestment." Not the University's finest hour. 
  </strong> 
<p> In my next Blog entry, I'll explain Archbishop Tutu's philosophy behind his 
  theology of reconciliation for integrating South Africa after apartheid and 
  how it can be used today in Minneapolis. 
<p> <strong>#164. Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu's "Ubuntu Theology of Reconciliation. 
  " Part 2 of 3. [</strong> Thursday, October 2, 2003, 12:25/5:20 p.m. <strong>] </strong> 
<p> Part 1 is #163. Some ask why I keep mentioning in public the fact that some 
  of the local Black leaders harangued my book for over an hour a year ago demanding 
  no one read it, no one buy it, just as they demand from our young Blacks to 
  get permission from them before they do anything (even though when they were 
  young they themselves didn't ask permission; see the moving story on this in 
  the Spokesman-Recorder (9/18-24/03, p. 1). Our local Black leadership are people 
  Archbishop Desmond Tutu would say are deeply in need of his "Ubuntu Theology 
  of Reconciliation." Too often, like the religious leaders in the story of the 
  Good Samaritan, they have passed by on the other side and not attended to the 
  broken ones in our community, preferring instead that the broken ones come to 
  their doors first. Their record is a scandal to those who follow Archbishop 
  Tutu (which I discuss in Chapter 14 of my book). And in Chapter 5 of my of my 
  book, I call for a common approach to use to resolve our conflicts and solve 
  our problems: apply the Golden Rule. At the heart of "justice and fairness" 
  (the title of my Chapter 5) is how we treat each other in order to give all 
  "equal access and equal opportunity." The leadership of the NAACP continues 
  to fail to apply the Golden Rule. In my book, on p. 99, I raise three questions:
<p><strong>First: </strong> To be fair or not to be fair, especially in education, 
  housing, and economic development (including jobs, living wages, and Black entrepreneurial 
  growth)? <strong>Second: </strong> To determine what the "do" is that we want 
  everyone to do unto everyone else: What is it? <strong>Third: </strong> Are 
  we willing to practice this individually and collectively? In other words, are 
  we willing to treat others in education, housing, jobs, wages, entrepreneurial 
  activity, the way we want to be treated? 
<p>In terms of the first one, what I see in terms of the Black community, is that 
  we are not being fair to our kids because of how we fight each other or fight 
  Whites from the stand point of what we as adults want not from the stand point 
  of what is good for the kids. In terms of the second one, I have answered "what 
  to do" by gathering all of my solutions in my book into Chapter 17 and in a 
  new paper, my &#8220;7 Solutions&#8221; in the Solution Papers section of this web site. 
  The seven areas are education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, and ethics. In terms of the third one: our treatment of each other 
  and of those outside our community has not followed either Rev. Leon Sullivan 
  (see Chapter 14 and 17) nor Archbishop Tutu (see Chapter 17), and for this any 
  person of conscience should feel shame. We can learn from them. In a nutshell, 
  unless we start practicing the Golden Rule, let go of the past but not forget 
  it, and focus on how to bring all up to speed in terms of education, jobs, housing, 
  public safety, etc., then we are all less. However, by working together to bring 
  these opportunities to everyone, to be sure that all are invited to the table, 
  we can all be more than we are. As Tutu says in his book No Future Without Forgiveness: 
<blockquote>
  <p>I am because we are. We belong together. Our humanity is bound up with one 
    another. We say in our languages, a person is a person through other persons. 
    A solitary being is a contradiction in terms. I learn how to become a human 
    being through association with other human beings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Tutu chaired the South Africa's <strong>Truth and Reconciliation 
  Commission. </strong> The Commission was a pioneering international event. Never 
  before had any country sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both 
  by exposing the atrocities committed in the past and by achieving reconciliation 
  with its former oppressors. This is a model, surely, for use in Ireland and 
  the Middle East. He emphasized restorative justice, not retributional justice. 
  As he says, "The future cannot be without forgiveness." Thus, "To forgive is 
  indeed the best form of self-interest, since anger, resentment, and revenge 
  are corrosive of that summum bonum, the greatest good." This is why, in Chapter 
  5 of my book, I demonstrate why the best response to each other is the Golden 
  Rule. The more we can do that the more we can respond with Dr. Martin Luther 
  King, Jr.'s non-violent responses, so we can stop the deferment of our dream, 
  and hasten the day when we attain the prize on which we all must keep our eyes. 
<p> <strong>#172. Minneapolis needs Archbishop Desmond Tutu's "Ubuntu Theology 
  of Reconciliation, " Part 3 of 3. [</strong> Saturday, October 4, 2003, 8:55 
  a.m. <strong>]</strong> 
<p>Here I let the Kirkus Review of Archbishop Tutu's book, No Future Without Forgiveness, 
  speak in this third statement (emphasis added): 
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>No Future Witout Forgiveness </strong> is the "&#8230;story of South 
    Africa&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a meditation 
    on evil and forgiveness from Nobel laureate Tutu (The Rainbow People of God: 
    The Making of a Peaceful Revolution, 1994). In 1994, South Africa faced a 
    historically unique situation. A long-oppressed majority had peacefully taken 
    power from its minority oppressor. As Tutu explains, <strong>the question 
    facing the nation was, What then to do? Should Nuremberg-like trials be held 
    against those who had maintained the ghastly system of apartheid? Or, as many 
    whites wished, should the past be forgotten, let bygones be bygones? </strong> 
    The new regime found what Tutu calls <strong>&#8220;a third way&#8221;</strong> 
    to deal with the past: the TRC. Those who had committed politically motivated 
    crimes during the apartheid era would receive <strong>amnesty if they made 
    full and truthful public disclosures. </strong> In turn, <strong>the victims 
    of such acts would be allowed to tell their stories</strong> in the hopes 
    that this would restore a measure of their human dignity. <strong>Over 18 
    months some 20,000 victims</strong> appeared before the commission, imparting 
    their tales of personal anguish--of torture, rape, imprisonment--but also <strong>exposing 
    a system perpetrated and supported by the highest levels of government, military, 
    and police. No longer could anyone deny knowledge of the past, as so many 
    whites had; never again would such an evil be allowed to exist in South Africa.</strong> 
    Yet it would be not only supporters of apartheid answering for their deeds. 
    <strong>Those who had committed crimes in the fight against the system, including 
    Winnie Mandela, would answer for their acts as well. </strong> Tutu&#8217;s 
    writing on this process is nothing short of miraculous. He is strong in his 
    defense of the commission that so many doubted as either too harsh or too 
    lenient. He is also anguished by the depths of human depravity the commission 
    hearings revealed, but passionately hopeful that human <strong>caring and 
    unity might prevail, in South Africa and the world. [a] sober depiction and 
    searing</strong> indictment of evil and [a] never-maudlin <strong>advocacy 
    of love." </strong> </p>
