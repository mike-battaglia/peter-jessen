<p><strong>5-27-06, Blog entry #5: <a href="http://www.yearlykos.org" target="_blank">BLOG CONVENTION</a>. </strong> <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/abt_ronedwards.htm">We</a> are proud to announce that our Publishing Company, <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com" target="_blank">Beacon on the Hill Press</a>, will be joining with other <strong>Independent Thinking and Freedom Seeking Bloggers</strong> to share ideas about the future. The alarm bells should be tolling in our minds anytime one community takes it upon itself to side step the Individual Rights of other communities, blocking their opportunities by denying them equal access to <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">America's Big 7</a>:</strong> <strong>E</strong>ducation, <strong>J</strong>obs, <strong>H</strong>ousing, <strong>P</strong>ublic <strong>S</strong>afety (including tracking <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionspapers13emergency.htm">the war on young Black men</a>), <strong>E</strong>nvironment, and <strong>E</strong>thics (of access and opportunity, of liberty and justice for all). <strong>The goal of <a href="#top">Tracking the Gaps</a> blog:</strong> <strong>to influence public policy and personal morality</strong> in order to contribute to ending the access/opportunty gaps  imposed on inner city minorities, and to positively influence Black organizations (even <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">the NAACP has taken its eye off the prize</a>) and to <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/19higherhopes.htm">positively impact Black males</a>. In our book, <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/pages/order.htm" target="_blank"><strong>The Minneapolis Story, through our eyes</strong></a>, we describe in detail how Minneapolis works to keep inner city Blacks &quot;in their place&quot;. Minneapolis is not alone. Minneapolis is  showing Seattle, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., S.F., New Orleans, Newark, etc. how to do so. Our book, stands for <strong>TRUTH &amp; <a href="http://www.citizensforfairnessandjustice.com/" target="_blank">JUSTICE</a>, FREEDOM &amp; LIBERTY.</strong> Our book and web site's unique approach to tracking the gaps through our site's <strong><a href="#top" target="_blank">Blog</a></strong>, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocarchives.htm">weekly columns</a> , and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocsolutions.htm">solution sets</a>,  will continue to tell the story of Minneapolis, which is also <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/03minnstory.htm">America's story</a>. Which cities will lead in tearing down the &quot;walls&quot; and machinery that work to keep minorities &quot;in their place&quot;? Which cities will continue to erect such &quot;walls&quot; and machinery to sustain and increase the gaps? Use our <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/pages/order.htm" target="_blank">Book</a> and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/music/pages/story_selections.html" target="_blank">CD</a> and<strong><a href="#top"> Blog</a></strong> and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">Building Blocks</a> and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Solution sets</a> to impact your global concerns (including <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/15nineeleven.htm">9/11</a>) where it counts: in your city, so together, we can all be part of the solution and challenge those who remain part of the problem to work with us to <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/08conflictresmodel.htm">resolve</a> conflict, to <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/18ubuntu.htm">reconcile</a> solutions and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm">achieve the dream.</a> <br>
