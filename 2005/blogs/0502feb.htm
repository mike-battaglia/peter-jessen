  <br>
  <strong>At the Super Bowl 2005,</strong> Commissioner Paul Tagliabue admitted 
  that the NFL had not done enough in terms of hiring Black executives. He promised 
  to move forward. We know that the NFL wants to do the right thing: not deny 
  a qualified bidder, not deny the property rights of Red McCombs. <br>
  The Strib issued a <a href="http://startribune.com/stories/1519/5252797.html" target="_blank">&#8220;what 
  Reggie needs to know about the Vikings&#8221;</a> piece. So we wish 
  to respond in kind and issue this &#8220;What the NFL and the NFL owners need 
  to know about Minnesota.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  We know Reggie Fowler Is qualified to own the Vikings. We also know of the obstacles 
  being tossed into his path by Minnesotans, especially those of the Twin City 
  variety, obstacles due to his color, hiding behind false statements and innuendoes 
  regarding his finances, qualifications, and stadium building abilities.<br>
  <br>
  As discussed below, there is a new elephant in the Minnesota living room: Red 
  McComb&#8217;s acceptance of Reggie Fowler&#8217;s bid for the Vikings. Minnesota 
  wants to get ride of this new elephant. It prefers its rhinoceros in its Minnesota 
  living room: the rhinoceros of racism. We have dealt with this before on our 
  2002 web page, <a href="http://www.citizensforfairnessandjustice.com" target="_blank">Citizens 
  for Fairness and Justice</a>. And we have dealt with it in our book 
  <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>. Chapter 15 dealt with the preference 
  of Minnesota to kick the Vikings out of town, a thesis that is also in the book 
  by Strib reporter Jay Weiner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0816634343/qid=1109568458/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4824662-8252627?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Stadium 
  Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and bush League Boondoggles.</a> 
  We have also developed a &#8220;roll call&#8221; of those trying to get rid 
  of the team or threatening to. <br>
  <br>
  Red and Reggie are on the right track. Numerous owners have stated the deal 
  is good. But Minnesotans are trying to sabotage it. We write in defense of the 
  bid, not because Reggie is Black but because he is qualified, and that despite 
  his being qualified, he is being sabotaged just because he is Black. Certain 
  Minnesotans are trying to discredit his qualifications because they don&#8217;t 
  want a Black owner EVEN THOUGH FOR THREE YEARS they have had a chance to make 
  an acceptable bid and have not. Now that a Black has made a bid they are rushing 
  to anoint Glen Taylor instead. This piece, then, is about what the NFL needs 
  to know about Minnesota.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Let&#8217;s review.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Spring 2002: Red McCombs</strong> of San Antonio, Texas, Spring 2002, 
  put his NFL football team, The Minnesota Vikings, up for sale. For nearly three 
  years no one was willing to meet his <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/sport/2004/09/01/04nfland.html" target="_blank">fair 
  market price.<br>
  </a><br>
  <strong>February 2005: Reggie Fowler</strong> of Phoenix, Arizona bid the fair 
  market price Red wanted, proved to Red that he and his partners could complete 
  the sale, and had his bid accepted by Red. <br>
  Reggie Fowler becomes the first Black owner of an NFL team. And therein lies 
  the rub.<br>
  <br>
  And even though USA Today printed a story declaring that<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank"> 
  &#8220;League owners optimistic Vikings sale will go through,</a> we 
  are seeing evidence that there are those behind the scenes who are hiding behind 
  contrived technicalities to make sure that the NFL and the Vikings ownership 
  remains <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/507/5212396.html" target="_blank">Whites 
  only: Blacks need not apply.</a> In other words, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">Glen 
  campaigned against Reggie, with Sid Hartman serving as Glen&#8217;s mouthpiece</a>. 
  The major &#8220;carrot&#8221; held out to the NFL is a bribe: deny Reggie, 
  accept Glen, and Glen will get the league a new stadium. This is a contemptible 
  straw man: the new stadium will be built, but in Minnesota&#8217;s time frame. 
  No one but Reggie has declared a willingness to abide by that time frame (NLT 
  2011) except Reggie IF he is unable to get movement before that (now in order 
  to effect a new stadium opening to dove tail with the St. Cloud corrido: 2008).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Bottom line, </strong>with media based evidence listed below and from 
  40 years of community activist work and experience such that &#8220;we have 
  practically seen it all,&#8221; it is our contention that Reggie Fowler can 
  make the application because he is qualified to be the Vikings owner, as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>He meets the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5239946.html" target="_blank">financial 
    strength</a> required by the NFL. </li>
  <li>One of his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5238724.html">partners</a><strong> 
    </strong>has professional (NBA) team ownership experience. </li>
  <li>Two of his closest <strong>aides</strong>, Kevin Warren and John Misler, 
    are old NFL hands as former players or executives in the NFL. </li>
  <li> He is <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">an 
    experienced businessman who knows how to put a deal together,</a> having begun 
    businesses in packaging, aviation, construction, broadcasting, banking, real 
    estate and a Disney theme park, and his Spiral, Inc. is ranked 11th among 
    the top 100 black businesses specializing in industrial/services in 2004, 
    according to <a href="http://www.blackenterprise.com/BE100sItem.asp?Id=is20041011&txtSearchFor=Spiral%2BInc%2E&MaxResults=0&YearBegin=0&YearEnd=7&onLineInfo=Yes" target="_blank">Black 
    Enterprise magazin</a>e, and as also reported <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank">in 
    USA Today</a></li>
  <li> He has a process for solving the stadium question. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Four sets of &#8220;signals&#8221; give us pause:</strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li> The Glen campaign signals</li>
  <li> The Strib discredit campaign signals</li>
  <li> The Randy trade signals</li>
  <li>Tthe Winter Park leak signals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Glen Signal</strong> is first seen in two articles even before 
  the press conference announcing the deal is held, one by Reusse and the other 
  by Weiner, on the 13th, as <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236647.html" target="_blank">Glen 
  foretells the future as he sees it</a><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236647.html" target="_blank">: 
  </a></strong>Red will accept Reggie&#8217;s bid to put a floor under his price; 
  Reggie will fail; and Glen will pick up the Vikings ball, and, as he is the 
  only one who do so, will can get a stadium out of the legislature (but if they 
  don&#8217;t give him a tax subsidized stadium Glen said he would move the team, 
  so the only hope the NFL and the state have to keep the team, according to Glen, 
  is through a deal with the legislature that Glen&#8217;s past experience in 
  that body ensures). And in case anyone misses this point, in the Weiner article, 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.htm" target="_blank">Glen 
  made it clear he is has accepted his anointed</a> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.htm">one 
  to buy the team</a><strong>,</strong> or, as would put it, as the Great 
  White Hope saving the locals, saving Red, and saving the NFL from the Black 
  buyer. And how does the &#8220;official&#8221; sports voice of Minnesota put it, 
  the day after the announcement of Reggie buying the team? He sets the stage 
  for the later resume flap by flat out sayng in his headline that<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.html" target="_blank"> 
  Franchise could be moved,</a> which sets up his later pieces saying 
  that only Glen can be a stadium out of the legislatuare, which is his signal 
  to to the NFL to turn Reggie down so Glen can have the team and get them a stadium. 
  It is also a thinly veiled statement not to believe anything Reggie says.<br>
  <br>
  The Strib signals came before and after the press conference in which Red said 
  he accepted Reggie&#8217;s bid. The Strib really piled it on, publishing numerous 
  innuendoes, making the flat out statement before hand that <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">&#8220;</a></strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">Clancy 
  didn&#8217;t buy the Vikings, and neither will Fowler&#8221;</a><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">. 
  </a></strong><br>
  <br>
  The Strib has constantly declared in numerous articles that Reggie doesn&#8217;t 
  have the money, following Glen&#8217;s statement that Reggie didn&#8217;t have 
  the money, and says <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">&#8220;There 
  isn&#8217;t any doubt that the league will do all it can to make sure Taylor owns 
  the team, if there is going to be a change in ownership.&#8221;</a> 
  Indeed, Weiner admits, the day after Red announced he accepted Reggie&#8217;s 
  bid, that &#8220;during a round of media interviews last week,&#8221; Glen &#8220;aggressively 
  questioned Fowler&#8217;s ability to gain approval from the NFL because he wanted 
  to give McCombs time to respond before going public.&#8221; In other words, 
  he was trying to sabotage Reggie&#8217;s deal and at the same time sabotage 
  Red by trying to force him to take his offer which Red has already told him 
  numerous times that he would not accept. With friends like Glen, you certainly 
  don&#8217;t need enemies.<br>
  <br>
  The NFL needs to stand up to that damning statement of the Strib. The Strib 
  is signaling to the NFL that it is &#8220;OK&#8221; to deny Reggie as Glen will 
  pick up the ball and all will be well. And for those who maybe didn&#8217;t 
  get it, they published a condescending editorial called &#8220;<a href="http://startribune.com/stories/1519/5252797.html" target="_blank">A 
  few things Fowler needs to know,</a> in which the Strib hides behind 
  the anonymity of being an &#8220;editorial,&#8221; offering all that it hates 
  about the Vikings going back to 1970. And who are most of the villains of their 
  piece? Black men, singling out a Black player, Brent McClanahan, and a Black 
  Coach, Dennis Green, as if all that is wrong with the team is summed under the 
  color Black. The inference is clear: steer clear of trouble by steering clear 
  of this Black owner. How contemptible. The low regard in which the team is held 
  by the Strib is seen in the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5247482.html" target="_blank">Nick 
  Coleman negative piece</a> that manages to attempt to discredit not 
  only Reggie, but the Vikings, Red, and Dennis Green.<br>
  <br>
  What shocks about the Strib that they have allowed their hatred and bigotry 
  to dump all over the Minnesota Vikings fan as if they are dumb and stupid. What 
  a love hate relationship the Strib has, calling the team &#8220;an irreplaceable 
  asset to the region&#8221; and yet calling it a team that people want to love 
  but really don&#8217;t, and then bolster&#8217;s Glen&#8217;s stadium claim 
  by saying Minnesotans are against public monies for a stadium but constantly 
  providing space for the notion that only Glen Taylor can get a tax payer subsidized 
  stadium out of the legislature. The Strib also provided a gratuitous advice 
  on PR to Fowler that goes beyond advice: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/357/5243089.html" target="_blank">it 
  attempts to discredit Fowler</a>. Through all of these it is almost 
  as if is preparing the way for the eventual announcement that Fowler has been 
  denied and they can say I told you so. The Strib even tries to discredit Reggie 
  in their piece that would seem, from the title, to be positive, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5250622.html" target="_blank">Fowler 
  proves he can tackle big challenges. </a>When Reggie&#8217;s PR firm 
  put out a company bio without checking with him (company bios are different 
  from job hunting bios) the Strib released a hurricane of articles about it using 
  them to &#8220;prove&#8221; that Reggie is not qualified. They tried to make 
  it a Notre Dame moment, as if this was an &#8220;O&#8217;Leary Affair.&#8221; But it clearly was 
  not. Was it bad PR? Most certainly: when they can&#8217;t &#8220;get you&#8221; on the big issues 
  that count they go after you on the little ones that are irrelevant. Does it 
  discredit Reggie? Most certainly not. But it is used to &#8220;justify&#8221; questioning 
  everything and tar him with a very broad brush suggesting questions where none 
  really exist. It gives those who want to the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5247482.html" target="_blank">excuse 
  to say &#8220;This kind of thing casts doubt on everythingb about him and everything 
  he says from now on.</a>&#8221; That&#8217;s about as broad a brush as you can 
  use. And please note: it kept O&#8217;Leary out of Notre Dame, but most assume something 
  else was involved. Note it had absolutely no impact in terms of his joining 
  the staff of the Vikings. Does it teach Reggie a lesson about Minneapolis media? 
  How could it not?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Randy signal</strong> came in the form of the Strib article of 2-17-05 
  reporting <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5251651.html" target="_blank">Reggie 
  saying he would not trade Randy Moss,</a><br>
  only to be followed up six Strib articles on February 24 by the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5256783.html" target="_blank">Vikings 
  announcing a trade of Randy to Oakland</a> (see also <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5257573.html" target="_blank">here</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5257551.html" target="_blank">here</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5256817.html" target="_blank"> 
  here</a>, and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5257590.html" target="_blank">here</a>). 
  This is way too much detailed information in so short a time: they were obviously 
  working on this, meaning that the old &#8220;leak machine&#8221; from inside 
  Winter Park to the Strib is alive and well. And even though it is Red&#8217;s 
  machine, and even if it is acting in &#8220;rogue&#8221; fashion, it ultimately 
  required his decision, which raises the interesting question in the Collins 
  bylined article, &#8220;Who the heck signed off on this?&#8221; No one is taking 
  credit. And Fowler remains quiet. In the Scoggins and Zulgad piece the Packers 
  take this as a great gift to them. Surely Viking executives facing a new owner 
  would not go against what they read he wanted. This suggests that a behind the 
  scenes &#8220;deal&#8221; has been concluded that will enable them to deny Reggie 
  what is now legally and rightfully his.<br>
  <br>
  This episode (actually a continuation of others) also suggests that no matter 
  who the new owner is, they may well have to fire many of the old &#8220;veterans.&#8221; 
  If the Strib stories are true, Winter Park employees can&#8217;t be trusted 
  with company information. They knew Glen kept getting turned down. They knew 
  Reggie was working on a bid that was designed to meet Red&#8217;s price, and 
  yet they continued to provide &#8220;inside information&#8221; to Glenn and 
  his people. As Weiner reported February 11, 2005, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5234939.html" target="_blank">&#8220;</a></strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5234939.html" target="_blank">Taylor 
  said that employees of the Vikings who had been working with him in sharing 
  financial information told him they could no longer &#8216;helps us because 
  they&#8217;re working with the other group,&#8217; Taylor said</a><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5234939.html" target="_blank">.&#8221;</a></strong> 
  The Winter Park crowd obviously got cold feet as they learned Red was going 
  to accept Reggie&#8217;s bid. The question now is, who&#8217;s side will be they on 
  with the new owner?<br>
  <br>
  This all adds up to why we say the finances are easy but the color is hard. 
</p>
<p><strong>Red has one of the smartest financial men in Gary Woods</strong>. Red 
  is shrewd businessman (San Antonio Express-News, August 5, 2002, p. 1A; requires 
  registration and payment to see article, entitled &#8220;Is stadium McCombs&#8217; 
  goal?&#8221;) who has owned professional teams before. Red and Gary wouldn&#8217;t 
  make a deal if they didn&#8217;t think it could be done. Reggie is a fellow 
  businessman and millionaire. His millionaire partners would not have joined 
  him if they didn&#8217;t think it could be done. Red and Gary and Reggie&#8217;s 
  partners are not in the business of making themselves look either stupid or 
  foolish. But there are those who would do so (try to make them look silly and 
  stupid) to block the sale. So &#8220;whither goest thou, NFL?&#8221; Like everyone 
  else, we&#8217;ll stay tuned to see what flag they run up the flagpole: the 
  NFL claims they will display the U.S. flag. Minnesota wants them to display 
  the &#8220;Blacks need not apply&#8221; flag. What the Minneapolis anti-Reggie 
  group is left with is &#8220;the stadium defense&#8221; for denying Fowler: 
  only Glen can get the money out of the legislature, which is stuff and nonsense. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Our clear response: Reggie has made the deal</strong>. Turn the keys 
  over to him. He meets the financial requirements. &#8220;<strong>Overcome</strong>&#8221; 
  and <strong>&#8220;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1890434523/qid=1109640837/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4824662-8252627?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">overcoming</a><strong>&#8220; 
  </strong>(as in &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221;) are words that again come into 
  play. <strong>Reggie must overcome</strong> those trying to block him from owning 
  the team. <strong>Red must overcome </strong>those who would try to control 
  what he does with his private property. <strong>The NFL must overcome</strong> 
  &#8220;Minnesota ice&#8221; and play by the &#8220;fairness and justice rules.&#8221; 
  As we do with any racist blocks we see thrown at any Black American in Minneapolis, 
  we &#8220;pull the covers&#8221; off to expose it as we continue our battle 
  against any who would deny qualified others equal access and equal opportunity. 
  Any thing we can do to encourage all involved to do the right thing we will 
  do. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Be very clear</strong>: we do not take up this challenge because Reggie 
  is Black but rather because although Reggie is a qualified buyer, the obstacles 
  thrown in his path are because he is Black. We fight red lining (the practice 
  of denying service to any living within a given areas) in all its forms, whether 
  the banking redlining related to denying mortgages to those with their map&#8217;s 
  redline circles or blocks, or whether related to viewing those within the color 
  red line of &#8220;not the same&#8221; or &#8220;dumber&#8221; and thus deny 
  quality education, jobs, housing, and public safety, or, in the Minnesota case 
  of Reggie, defining a Black person as a walking red line. We see signs that 
  Reggie is being redlined by racist innuendoes and shadow remarks and different 
  rules, just as Blacks were given different rules for qualifying to vote during 
  the jim crow days. This book, column, and web log fight racism and for any who 
  are under siege, White or Black, male or female, rich or poor, as continue to 
  stand up for equal opportunity against any who would deny it, be it the White 
  owners of the NFL or the Black officer of the NAACP. <br>
  <br>
  In other words, as Fowler is qualified, <strong>we&#8217;ll now find out the 
  true hand of the NFL</strong>: will it take this long overdue step of no longer 
  blocking Blacks from being owners or it will it show its own segregationist 
  colors and hide behind the false and and inaccurate racist statement that they 
  have no bench depth in terms of Black executives? <br>
  <br>
  In saying this we recognize that we will be accused of &#8220;playing the race 
  card.&#8221; Of course. You can&#8217;t win a card game without playing all the cards. 
  It is due to an obsession with political correctness that brings the blindness 
  to racism to the table. As we should have no racism and as we are good people 
  we can&#8217;t be racist. I pull the covers off this in my book in regards to education, 
  jobs, housing, etc. The contnued bottling up in our inner cities of a population 
  provide poor education, poor jobs (or none), and poor housing, is either out 
  of cruelty or out of a racist belief that they are not of any value above these 
  levels. So let us reword this: we are playing the &#8220;observe the racism&#8221; 
  card. The Strib itself published a series on racism in 1990 about the rampant 
  racism in the Twin Cities and Minnesota, as did the Mpls.St. Paul Magazine (see 
  my book&#8217;s Interludes 2 and 10). In a 2000 cover story on Dennis Green 
  the magazine noted the racism of Minneapolis was still well and very much alive. 
  Indeed, we made he case in our Column 2004/#25, December 2, 2004, discussing 
  the racist skin head company known as Panzerfaust records in S. Paul, the state 
  capital, makes and distributes racist CDs to middle and high school kids, bragging 
  proudly that &#8220;we don&#8217;t just entertain racist kids. We create them.&#8221; 
  So far, in the local White media: mum&#8217;s the word, although Panzerfaust 
  was covered by national TV news. Think about that: &#8220;we don&#8217;t just 
  entertain racist kids. We create them.&#8221; And the Twin Cities remain silent. 
  We believe the NFL will not be held to the racist blackmail offered by the so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; trying to discredit Reggie Fowler.<br>

<p align="left"><strong>2/24/05/#20: Column #4 Follow-up: Major Incident at Franklin 
  Middle School yesterday. See Today&#8217;s column, 2005/#4<br>
  </strong>The violence at Franklin Middle School discussed in today&#8217;s column 
  is still ignored by the Star Tribune which continues to refuse to report it, 
  despite my giving the information to the Star Tribune reporter early last. The 
  problem boiled over again Wednesday, 2-23-05, when a major incident took place, 
  in which a number of students were fighting, a counselor was injured, and several 
  squad cars had to be called to help restore order. The Strib continues its ethically 
  challenged response of silence as it ignores our own Berlin Wall of lousy schools, 
  jobs, and housing for inner city minorities.<br>

<p align="left"><strong>2/24/05/#19: Column #3 Follow-up: Berlin Wall Falls in 
  Beirut. When will the wall fall in Minneapolis?<br>
  </strong>Those caught up in &#8220;anti-war vs. pro-war&#8221; rhetoric miss the 
  point. No one is for the war. Most of us wich the Iraq war could have been avoided. 
  We all wish the UN had followed through on the many resolutions ignored that 
  led to it. And we wish the bribery and other scandals that caused the UN to 
  look the other way regarding the war as well as other matters had not happened 
  as well. But to those of us for whom Black History Month means something, we 
  cannot but pause to ponder the significance of the Lebonese leader who up until 
  now suppored Syrian occupation, to stand up against it and call for the liberation 
  of his people. In his Washington Post column Wednesday, 2-23-05, David Ignatius 
  writes of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45575-2005Feb22.html" target="_blank">&#8221;Beirut&#8217;s 
  Berllin Wall</a>&#8221;. He quotes one of the anti-Syrian leaders, Walid Jumblatt, 
  who the Strib acknowledges exists but treats as routine rather than as stunningly 
  significant. Here is what Jumblatt said that the Strib ignores: &#8220;It&#8217;s strange 
  for me to say it, but this process of change has started because of the American 
  invasion of Iraq. I was cynical about Iraq. But when I saw the Iraqi people 
  voting three weeks ago, 8 million of them, it was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45575-2005Feb22.html" target="_blank">the 
  start of a new Arab world</a><strong>.</strong> The Syrian people, the Egyptian 
  people, all say that something is changing. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45575-2005Feb22.html" target="_blank">The 
  Berlin Wall has fallen.</a> We can see it.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/5253072.html">Strib</a> 
  didn&#8217;t even get the importance of this in its own story, and especialy missed 
  the significance of its own statement that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/670/5251962.html" target="_blank">&#8221;some 
  protesters held a copy of the Quran in one hand and a cross in another.&#8221;</a> 
  Just as the Strib remains silent about the violence in Minneapolis it keeps 
  silent about the violence of the Syranians in Lebanon. When will the Strib bring 
  judgment about the tyranny of Syria and stop writing as if Syria represents 
  stability? Why the support of a country that holds another in tyranny? Why can&#8217;t 
  the Strib recognize what the Lebanese and Egyptians are saying? When will the 
  racism that Arabs can&#8217;t handle democracy end? When will the racism that Blacks 
  can&#8217;t handle large enterprizes or live free without needing government direction 
  end? With Iran poised to have missiles that will reach Berlin, it may be that 
  this democracy thing just might be a great help to world peace and stability. 
  Don&#8217;t we all agree that 11 million dying in Nazi concentration camps (6 million 
  Jews, 5 million other &#8220;undesirables&#8221;) was too high a price to pay 
  as the only way to ethically ignore genocide? The Berlin Wall fell in Berlin. 
  It has now fallen in Beirut. <a href="http://dsadevil.blogspot.com"> David Schraub</a>, 
  graduate student at Carleton Collgege in Northfield, suggests the excellent 
  question of why the world is not, to use our phrase, pounding on the Berlin 
  Wall of Genocide in Darfur and the Sudan? Ethics is our &#8220;issue #7.&#8221; 
  We agree with David when he says whoever in &#8220;the US, the UN, the EU, and 
  the Arab League&#8221; doesn&#8217;t respond to Darfur and the Sudan &#8220;permanently 
  forfeits any claims to moral leadership in the world.&#8221; We&#8217;ll address later 
  our thoughts regarding Minneapolis&#8217; Belin Wall of lousy inner city education, 
  jobs and housing in a later post within the next week.<br>

<p align="left"><strong>2/12/2005/#17: Strib & the Bosses Play the Race Card: 
  Put Fowler in his place.</strong> 
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> only Fowler promises to keep the Vikings in Minnesota, 
  regardless of who pays for a new stadium. Taylor, the Great White Hope, in conjunction 
  with the Strib, intimidates and threatens Vikings fans by saying if they don&#8217;t 
  pay for a new stadium the team leaves. Their response to Fowler: smears and 
  sneers. So ask yourself, Minnesota, what&#8217;s more important: keeping the team 
  in Minnesota or having a potential White owner who is threatening to move the 
  team even before he buys it? Is Minnesota so racist it is willing to risk cutting 
  off its Vikings nose to spite Black faces? Taylor says he&#8217;ll play Fagan and 
  send out his legislative kids to pick the taxpayers&#8217; pockets. Fowler promises 
  to run the team like a business and will make it work either way, with or without 
  legislative participation. Do you appreciate the irony of the White guy Fagan 
  asking for government welfare pick pocketing the taxpayer and the Black guy 
  saying he can make it on his own? 
<p><strong>Fowler as a hitching post. </strong> In their piece today, 2-12-05, <a href= http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236647.html > 
  Taylor hopes to hook Vikes, </a>the Star Tribune acts as if Reggie Fowler, 
  the Black bidder for the Vikings, is but a hitching post at the river&#8217;s edge 
  to which Glenn Taylor can tie his Vikings ship. The article makes clear that 
  between Taylor and the NFL, Taylor can confidently state that after the NFL 
  slaps down any Fowler deal with McCombs, “he anticipates he eventually will 
  be the next owner of the Vikings.” 
<p><strong>Minneapolis: Fagan&#8217;s school for thieves. </strong> In Oliver Twist, Fagan teaches 
  young boys how to be great pickpockets and keep society in its place. In my 
  book I write about how Minneapolis is out to teach America how to raise taxes 
  to enrich the powers while at the same time how to keep the powerless minorities 
  in their place “in terms of education, housing, jobs and the war on young Black 
  men,” determined to show America “how to control a city.” Now it is going to 
  put the Vikings fans in their place: Taylor says when he buys the team and fans 
  don&#8217;t pay new taxes for a new stadium he&#8217;ll move the team out of town. 
<p><strong>Minnesota nice or Minnesota racism? </strong> I write this to again bell the 
  racist cat, and create awareness for Minnesotans that if they allow Minnesota 
  racism to rule, they could lose their team. Taylor has an out of state investor 
  axis. This leaves the team in peril. Fowler is using local investors in his 
  group, all of whom have pledged to keep the team in Minnesota. The Strib has 
  again stooped to propagandizing and smearing. 
<p><strong>Taylor suggests that the fix is in. But we can fight the fix. </strong> What 
  is galling is the bragging that the “fix” is already in. No subtlety, no euphemism. 
  The Strib is showing how the “powers” run the place the way they want. They 
  are so sure no one can stop them that they announce what they have planned in 
  advance. Note that Taylor says he has already met with the NFL, that the upcoming 
  Fowler deal with Red will be slapped down by the NFL “when it gets to the league 
  office,” and thus the article triumphantly announces that Taylor “anticipates 
  he eventually will be the next owner of the Vikings.” 
<p><strong>Taylor: Twins lover says taxpayers pay or the Vikings leave. </strong> Taylor 
  admits his preference is to buy the Twins. So why the switch? We see three reasons: 
  to block, to Augusta, to greed. 
<ul>
  <strong>To Block</strong> a Black owner (Fowler), and to block a guy (Fowler) who does 
  not and will not threaten to move the team if he doesn&#8217;t get a new stadium as 
  he says he can get it done either way.<br>
  <strong>To Augusta</strong> (as in the Georgia golf club), Minnesota style, NFL style: 
  no Black members get in to the white male owner&#8217;s club under any circumstances. 
  <br>
  <strong>To greed: </strong> Taylor believes he can get the legislature to pony up taxpayer 
  money for him for a new stadium as he used to be a legislator. What is he, Fagan, 
  sending out the legislators to pick the pockets of the fans? 
</ul>
<p><strong>Stadium intimidation and the greed factor. </strong> Fowler says he can get a 
  stadium built even if there are no new taxes raised. Taylor says raise taxes 
  for his new stadium or the team leaves town. Fowler says he can work it out 
  (and certainly the models are available to enable that). Taylor suggests work 
  is too hard, and instead finds threats and intimidation easier: if the taxpayers 
  don&#8217;t foot the bill for a new stadium, the team moves (he is not interested 
  in the models that would enable building a new stadium without new taxes). And 
  how “poor” is Taylor? He admits he has more than the $1.9 billion estimated 
  by Forbes. Imagine: the 118th wealthiest guy in America and he already is threatening 
  to move the team if the legislature doesn&#8217;t provide tax payer dollars to build 
  him a new stadium for a team that has been in existence for over 40 years that 
  he has had nothing to do with. And the Strib sits by and raises no moral or 
  ethical question about a guy buying and immediately threatening to move the 
  peoples&#8217; team. Fowler says he can build a new stadium without needing new taxes. 
  This tells me that Taylor is a fair weather fan and is willing to sacrifice 
  Minnesota&#8217;s beloved Vikings if he has to put up a nickel. Fowler will fight 
  for the fan. This also tells me that Fowler is the Vikings fans hope: he&#8217;ll 
  find a way because he wants to and because he is willing to follow models that 
  already exist that will enable it to be done that Taylor won&#8217;t look at. 
<p><strong>Why have the Vikings, the Twins, the Strib, and the legislature ignored 
  models that provide for stadium construction without new taxes? </strong> In my Column 
  of January 26 (2005/#2) I point out the legislature and the teams in 2000 received 
  models for how to build new stadiums without new taxes. None were interested. 
  They don&#8217;t want to run it like a business but as a welfare entitlement. I trust 
  the reader is aware of the irony here: the White guy says he needs a government 
  handout, the Black guy says he doesn&#8217;t. 
<p><strong>The intimidation and threat to leave is seamlessly woven together with the 
  collusion of the NFL to put in the fix. </strong> Some people feel I was being too 
  harsh in my earlier column (January 26, 2005/#2). Read the “roll call” of threats 
  at the end of the column in my online version (in the column to the left) and 
  ask yourself: was I too harsh or not harsh enough? Taylor says “The NFL will 
  make it clear that Minnesota will have to make a commitment to a new stadium 
  if we we&#8217;re going to keep our team.” Thus, says Taylor, without such a commitment, 
  “The NFL would insist the team be moved, or the franchise would be dissolved.” 
  Does Taylor stand up to that? No. He agrees: no taxpayer paid stadium means 
  no team. Fowler stands up? Why? Because he is bold enough to do so, because 
  he has vision, and because he knows there are models and other resources to 
  enable him to be successful. 
<p><strong>Why LA. Over Minnesota? </strong> How can the NFL offer $500 million to build 
  a new L.A. stadium and not do so for Minnesota? Is the team to move anyway? 
  Taylor says he is OK with that. Fowler says no: the team stays, as he can make 
  a stadium happen. I believe Fowler. Any Black man in America who becomes a millionaire 
  can probably achieve whatever it is he wants regardless of the roadblocks thrown 
  up to try to stop him. I understand that Fowler is also a pilot with two planes. 
  Obviously Fowler is no cotton picker. Note that Taylor doesn&#8217;t take Fowler on 
  one-on-one, mano a mano. Rather Taylor gangs up on Fowler with NFL help. That 
  is not sportsmanlike. That tells me Taylor wont&#8217; be a sportsman with the fans 
  either. 
<p><strong>The NFL does not have the power Taylor says it does. </strong> Fowler is being 
  a gentleman. Why can&#8217;t Taylor be? Fowler sounds like the kind of guy you&#8217;d like 
  to do business with. I used to think that of Taylor but now I&#8217;m having my doubts. 
  Anyone who will not stand up for the team is not to be trusted. Do you want 
  to do business with a guy who says if he can&#8217;t get his way he&#8217;ll take his team 
  and leave? I don&#8217;t. Taylor wants to be part of an old boys&#8217; club that tells 
  others what to do. Fowler says it is the fans who are the most important. Fowler 
  stands up for the fans and says he&#8217;ll keep the team here regardless of what 
  the legislature does. Fowler knows that the NFL can&#8217;t make an owner sell or 
  dissolve his team if it is being profitable or if the owner wants to absorb 
  the losses. To do otherwise would mean that the NFL would be breaking anti-trust 
  laws. Why does Taylor paint the NFL as all-powerful? Because by doing their 
  bidding he gets what he wants, the Vikings and membership in an all White, all 
  male exclusive club. Why does the NFL say nothing when Taylor talks that way? 
  Because they are in on it. It is theit new taxes. Yet Taylor, worth over $2 
  billion, and the league want the fans to pay. Have Taylor and the NFL no shame? 
  Why do they want to play Fagan? And why do they think the legr wink to the insiders 
  acknowledging that even though they are like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, 
  they can still make people believe they are all powerful. Here we see that the 
  true NFL man is Fowler, not the NFL heads who would let the team go or Taylor 
  who would join them. Fowler stands for the league and the fans. Fowler knows 
  there are models available for building new stadiums withouislature will play 
  pickpockets when they have steadfastly refused so far to do so? And why do they 
  think the legislators don&#8217;t want to get re-elected? 
<p><strong>The Strib</strong> smears Fowler and propagandizes for Taylor all the while knowing 
  they are purposefully skewing the truth. They know everything I have written 
  here and in my columns is true. Why does The Star Tribune want to join the biased 
  journalism slanted reporting that has been the hallmark of CBS (think Dan Rather) 
  and CNN (think Eason Jordan)? 
<p><strong>Innuendo, smears, sneers. </strong> The Strib presents Fowler as just a little 
  Black “boy” out of his depth. Taylor makes it clear he feels he is better than 
  the Black man when he makes it clear he kept Fowler in his place. Rather than 
  meet in Taylor&#8217;s office, the Strib reporter, sitting in Taylor office with Taylor, 
  reports that “Taylor said Fowler had been in the conference room next door …to 
  discuss….” And Taylor makes it clear he won&#8217;t participate if a Black man is 
  the General (in control) Partner. And Taylor smears Fowler by saying that as 
  he, Taylor, wasn&#8217;t as willing to pay as much as Fowler, that he, Taylor, “suggested 
  that Fowler take the first shot at making a deal with McCombs,” so confident 
  is Taylor in the fix. And he admits that the fix involves the NFL as he admits 
  he “will now go to the high 500s after discussing the situation with the NFL.” 
<p><strong>If the NFL helped Red financially, why won&#8217;t it help Fowler? </strong> The NFL 
  loaned McCombs $100 million so he could outbid our local bidder. The NFL is 
  going to put up the $500 million needed for a new stadium in L.A. Why not for 
  Minnesota? So why can&#8217;t it help Fowler in this historic moment? Is it because 
  the NFL doesn&#8217;t want history to happen? The rumors are that the NFL also helped 
  Arthur Blank in Atlanta. Why? Because, as Taylor says, “the league wants franchise 
  prices to be as high as possible.” So what other owners have they helped and, 
  thus, again, why can&#8217;t they help Fowler as they helped the others. What can 
  be the only independent variable here? That Fowler is Black. 
<p><strong>The wild card: Red. </strong> The Strib has reported Red is eager to sell. Red&#8217;s 
  wife Charline has said that the Vikings belong to Minnesota. Will Red go against 
  this? This is America. Red is a proud American. If someone can pay Red&#8217;s price, 
  that is between he and Red. Why wouldn&#8217;t Red want to be part of a historic deal 
  that would ensure that his beloved Vikings would stay with their beloved fans? 
  Can others just step in to tell Red he can&#8217;t sell his property? In America? 
  They want us to think so. But Black men know that is usually just for Black 
  men. Which is why we have to work harder to succeed. That is why Reggie Fowler 
  will be good for the NFL even if they can&#8217;t see it yet. To block Reggie the 
  NFL would have to block Red. Is Red going to roll over and play dead for the 
  NFL and leave money on the table simply because the NFL doesn&#8217;t want a Black 
  owner? The NFL would be interfering with interstate commerce and breaking anti-trust 
  law. Does the NFL really want all its internal workings behind its curtain exposed 
  for all to see their collusion with Taylor against Fowler? Are they so against 
  a Black owner that they are willing to break the law as well as the ethics of 
  business to block the Black guy and threaten Minnesota fans with moving their 
  team if they don&#8217;t pony up more taxes for a rich owner? 
<p><strong>Where are Minnesota&#8217;s leaders in all of this? </strong> Taylor admits that ALL 
  of his investor partners are from outside Minneapolis. Answer this: why have 
  no other Minnesotans, in two years, stepped forward to put together a buying 
  group for the team unless the plan is still to send them out of town? Why has 
  it taken Fowler to involve locals? It would seem that if he can do that and 
  others cannot that Fowler would also have greater success with getting a stadium 
  than Taylor. Note that Fowler has uttered no threats. Indeed, Fowler has been 
  very clear that he can make it happen. He is acting like a gentleman. Taylor 
  is acting like a bully. Taylor says he can&#8217;t make it happen unless the legislature 
  plays Fagan and sends the legislators out to pick the pockets of the Minnesotan 
  taxpayer.

<p><strong>2/12/2005/#16: It looks like the Vikings will remain in Minnesota under 
  Fowler.</strong> [2-12-05, 10:30 pm: I may have spoken too soon. See #17 above]

  “powers” wanting the Vikings to leave town. My goal in writing about it was 
  in the hopes of creating a self-defeating prophecy: report the possibility of 
  something bad so someone would come along and prevent it. WCCO&#8217;s Mark Rosen 
  and the Strib&#8217;s Sid Hartman have all of a sudden begun to worry not about the 
  Vikings leaving (which until now has not been a problem for them) but about 
  Reggie Fowler buying the Vikings. It is ironic that despite the evidence of 
  even the Strib and the book “Stadium Games,” in two years no White man has come 
  forth to save the Vikings. The Great Saving Hope for the Vikings fans is the 
  Black man, Reggie Fowler. It has come to our attention that since our Column 
  #2 of January 26, things have started to change. Coincidence? We don&#8217;t know. 
  Doesn&#8217;t matter. All we know is that we now feel we can for the first time, state 
  believably that the NFL does not want the Vikings to leave town and move to 
  L.A. (not that it could stop them, as they could not). And instead of the “wish 
  world” fantasy of WCCO&#8217;s Rosen and the Strib&#8217;s Hartman that Fowler get knocked 
  out of the box, it now looks as if the new “is world” is that the Fowler deal 
  just might happen. That would be great. Time for the NFL to move into the 21st 
  century. Minnesota too. It is also time to lay to rest the question of whether 
  the team stays or moves. We know with Fowler the team will stay.<br>

<p><strong>2/12/2005/#15: Are cuts in Communty Development Block Grants good or

  denies it and still refuses to allow a release of the video tape. Why are you 
  hiding Eason? Is this an isolated incident or will we soon get accountability 
  from the Strib as well?<strong><br>

<p align="left"><strong><a name="0513b0208"></a>2/8/2005/#13: Truth a Star Tribune casualty again. It 
  doesn&#8217;t believe in the morning. With &#8220;There is No Tomorrow&#8221; it slanders 
  for ideology.</strong> 
<p align="left">Bill Moyers made a slanderous statement. The Star Tribune &amp; 
  Washington Post, among others, printed it as truth. The blogosphere (incuding 
  <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com" target="_blank">Powerline</a> 
  of Minneapolis) exposed it. The Washington Post printed a &#8220;correction&#8221; 
  7 days after the slander. The next day Bill Moyers &#8220;apologized profusely.&#8221; 
  9 days later The Star Tribune remains mute. Why? 
<p align="left">Those who have followed our columns dealing with the poor environmental 
  quality of low income housing sites such as our Heritage Park/Hollman (see Chapter 
  8 of our book) know clean ground, clean water, and clean air are high on our 
  list of priorities, as we believe it is for most Americans. Indeed, it is a 
  common ground place of most Americans, regardless of party. So we pause to congratulate 
  Bill Moyers, who called Reagan&#8217;s EPA Secretary James Watt today (Tuesday) and 
  <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009498.php" target="_blank">&#8220;apologized 
  profusely&#8221;</a> for having slandered Watt, claiming he hadsaid it was OK 
  to destroy the environment because of the pending end of the world was near. 
  That Watt never said it was not important to Moyers nor did Moyers feel he should 
  &#8220;fact check&#8221; before making his claim. We don&#8217;t want to seem churlish 
  but feel it important to point out that Moyers&#8217; apology didn&#8217;t come until after 
  the Washington Post, on Monday, the day before, printed a <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009475.php" target="_blank">correction</a> 
  indicating Moyers was wrong. 
<p align="left">This is the kind of ideological divisiveness sung as a Robin Hood 
  troubadour regaling the people about the Sheriff of Nottingham, except Watt 
  was not from Nottingham. This has no place in public policy debates, and divides, 
  not unites us in an area where we have great agreement (how well our elected 
  officials follow through to meet our shared ideal is another question, which 
  we address in chapter 8 of or book). So why does the Star Tribune play the role 
  of a troubadour making ups songs about people they don&#8217;t like? 
<p align="left">On January 30th, the Star Tribune printed Moyer&#8217;s piece, 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5211218.html" target="_blank">There 
  is no tomorrow</a><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5211218.html" target="_blank">. 
  </a></strong>Did no fact checking. Accepted it as gospel because it was from 
  a fellow liberal. As we have pointed out throughout our book, neither liberals 
  nor conservatives have a monopoly on truth. Both, in our messy democracy, are 
  duty bound to search for the truth not for false negatives to use as a club 
  rather than trying to solve a public policy problem. <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com" target="_blank">Powerline</a> 
  (our Minineapolis based Time Magazine blog of the year) gives a moving <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009475.php" target="_blank">account</a> 
  of this episode and provides a detailed analysis of why Moyers was slanderous 
  and a perveyor of falsehoods. <br>
  <br>
  So why, 9 days after printing the article and 2 days after the Post printed 
  its correction hasn&#8217;t the Star Tribune published its correction? Powerline offers 
  an <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009491.php" target="_blank">explanation</a> 
  as to why the Strib has not that rings true to us: &#8220;the Minneapolis Star 
  &#8230; has kept its readers in a cloud of unknowing&#8212;ignorance being conducive 
  to the Star Tribune&#8217;s liberal rapture.&#8221; We have felt that sense many times 
  as we have commented in our columns and blog entries. Because we all have common 
  cause in having the best for Minneapolis, we need to have all parties speaking 
  from the standpoint of objective reporting, not ideological celebrations that 
  condemn fellow citizens and cause them to be divided rather than united. 
<p align="left">This raises the question of how many other people has the Strib 
  slandered or falsely reported about simply because they don&#8217;t agree with them. 
  Why doesn&#8217;t the Strib care about and protect its credibility? Why does truth 
  continue to be a casualty at the Strib? 
<p align="left">We will continue to urge the Star Tribune to be accurate in its 
  reporting, and not slant every analysis and solution to a liberal only agenda, 
  as if our conservative friends and fellow citizens have nothing to offer. We 
  wonder if any circulation delines are due to this purposeful creation of a credibility 
  gap with its readers, even among its own liberal readers.<br>

<p><strong>2/7/2005/#12: Reading the Vikings tea leaves as served up by Red, the 
  NFL, and Sid Hartman.</strong> 
<p>Something is brewing? What? Sid Hartman describes some of the tea leaves brewing 
  in the bottom of our Vikings tea cup. Let&#8217;s see what they really say. 
  Sid, in his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/507/5225200.html" target="_blank">column</a> 
  of Sunday, Febraury 6, 2005. Let&#8217;s see what they really say. 
<p>Sid again raises the image for a Great White Hope. Nothing he says changes 
  anything we wrote in our last column (posted on this site as 2005/#2: &#8220;I 
  Told You So. Now Let&#8217;s Save the Vikings!&#8221;) or in our recent Blog 
  entry (2005/#9: &#8220;We can solve the NFL&#8217;s lack of depth in their managerial 
  Black bench. Sell to Black Fowler.&#8221;) 
<p>It is clear that Reggie Fowler really has Sid and the NFL worried. Imagine: 
  a Black man owning the team. About time, says I. Sid describes 7 tea leaves 
  brewing in the sale cup, to which we comment <strong>(Cmt</strong>): 
<p> <strong>(1) </strong>Fowler is close to making an offer. <strong>Cmt:</strong> 
  you can just hear them circling the wagons. Our response: excellent: we wish 
  Fowler well. <br>
  <strong>(2)</strong> The NFL Finance committee Chairman (New Orleans Saints 
  owner Tom Benson) says, &#8220;we are not going to admit owners who are not 
  100 percent qualified like some other professional leagues have done.&#8221; 
  <strong>Cmt:</strong> Really? Then why did the NFL loan Red McCombs $100 million 
  to buy the Vikings so he could outbid our local guy, a fact that was kept secret 
  and did not emerge for four years? And what about the rumors of other sweet 
  heart deals for other recent buyers? Why them and not Fowler? <br>
  <strong>(3)</strong> Benson says the general partner must own 30% of the purchase 
  amount. Sid quotes Benson as saying, &#8220;he can&#8217;t use the team as a 
  collateral to borrow more than $125 million of the purchase price. <strong>Cmt:</strong> 
  Really? Again, what about the $100 million the NFL loaned Red on top of his 
  collateralization? It sounds like the NFL is using Benson to &#8220;stiff arm&#8221; 
  Fowler. So lets look at the numbers: $100 million is NFL money; that leaves 
  $500 million of the $600 million asking price; $125 million can be used to collaterlize; 
  so that leaves $375 million; 30% of that is $102,500,000. But wait. Finance 
  is a game the White boys have played. Why not Black guys? Banks often use a 
  factor of 10 for enabling debt multiples. This suggests that all Fowler needs 
  is $10.2 million to factor to get his $102 million to close the deal (leaving 
  $162,500,000 for the limited partners to put up). So why is the NFL &#8220;stiff 
  arming&#8221; Fowler, &#8220;crack blocking&#8221; him, &#8220;interfering&#8221; 
  with and &#8220;holding&#8221; him? That&#8217;s four yellow flags that should 
  be on the field against Red and the NFL for the way they are treating Fowler. 
  And Fowler needs to throw out the red flag to challenge the &#8220;call&#8221; 
  Benson is making against him. <br>
  <strong>(4)</strong> Sid reports that the actual cash figure is $475 million 
  to meet the $600 million asking price. <strong>Cmt:</strong> This fits what 
  we said in our January 26th column and as we just discussed above. <br>
  <strong>(5) </strong>About Glenn Taylor, Sid writes, &#8220;there is no doubt 
  that the league wants him to own the Vikings&#8221; <strong>Cmt:</strong> Really? 
  Why would the NFL all of a sudden want a guy who has refused to cooperate with 
  their asking price unless it is an underhanded attempt to block Fowler? Or is 
  there a &#8220;fix&#8221; in already to block Fowler? <br>
  <strong>(6)</strong> Sid claims that Cris Carter says that the McCombs family 
  may not want to sell. <strong>Cmt:</strong> Say what? The team has been on the 
  market for two years; Red needs money for his Colorado development. So why are 
  Sid, the NFL, Taylor and who ever else to block Fowler? This looks to us like 
  another &#8220;holding&#8221; penalty to commit in case Fowler makes a bid so 
  Red can say no for now to avoid selling to a Black man. Sounds like Fowler needs 
  to toss out another red flag. We always thought Red was his own man. Is he a 
  puppet of the NFL? Isn&#8217;t that against the monopoly rules? <br>
  <strong>(7)</strong> The most preposterous claim of Sid is this, that &#8220;The 
  NFL knows that Taylor has the best chance of getting a new stadium built for 
  the team.&#8221; <strong>Cmt:</strong> Why Sid? If the 10 rich White Minnesotans 
  before Red couldn&#8217;t get it done, and the White Red can&#8217;t get it 
  done, then maybe the problem is that it is White guys trying. If rich White 
  guys can&#8217;t figure it out, can&#8217;t manage the hurdles, lets change 
  the common denominator from White to Black. Who better in America know how to 
  overcome hurdles and obstacles if not Black millionaires, guys who have overcome 
  hurdles and obstacles that would make the White guys collapse in a heap? 
<p>And as the Strib has reported that Fowler has stadium funding plans, which 
  is more than White Red or his White 10 predecessors had, why not sell to the 
  guy who isn&#8217;t holding his hand out for a tax payer hand out, Fowler? As 
  Fowler&#8217;s development plans don&#8217;t rely on new taxes, what&#8217;s 
  not to like? So, as the past and current team owners have threatened to move 
  the team unless tax payers pony up for a stadium (backed by NFL saying the same: 
  no stadium no stay), and as Fowler has pledged to not only keep the team here 
  but move here personally and not be an absentee landlord, shouldn&#8217;t he 
  be the one both the NFL and Minnesota should be bending over backwards to make 
  his bid happen, given that all the White guys have failed? 
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s get &#8220;real world&#8221;:</strong> we&#8217;d like 
  to know how much the NFL has loaned other recent buyers, (all White guys) And 
  we&#8217;d like to know which White boys will benefit from the fact that the 
  NFL, as reported on ESPN radio last May, is going to put up $400-500 million 
  for a new L.A.Coliseum. And if, as Sid reports, it will be an expansion team 
  (which, by the way, we are not yet ready to believe), what White guy will be 
  given that gold mine? And why is it that if the NFL can loan Red money to buy 
  the Vikings and it can front the money for the new stadium in L.A., it can&#8217;t 
  front (that is, finance, not fund) a new stadium for Minnesota? 
<p>The NFL lame blamed (during Super Bowl week in Jacksonville) their lack of 
  Black executives (NFL and teams) on the colleges and universities for not providing 
  them (as if the colleges and universities were their managerial farm club just 
  as they are for player). See our Blog #9. Now we ask you, isn&#8217;t the NFL 
  a big boy, able to train its own? Why must we ask the oh so obvious of why hasn&#8217;t 
  the NFL stepped in to do so? As it obviously doesn&#8217;t want to, what could 
  be better than having a Black owner of a team, in this case the Vikings, and 
  have him jump start the process of developing them? Or is the NFL of the mind 
  that it can somehow hide behind the skirts of history, as so many do, blaming 
  the victims, claiming their past makes them unqualified. 
<p>As Martin Luther King used to say, we may not be qualified but we are definitely 
  qualifyable. See this at work in the upcoming PBS special &#8220;Slavery and 
  the Making of America&#8221; (see Blog #11 below). 
<p>The NFL is obviously trotting out the old and lame excuse that &#8220;they 
  are not ready&#8221; (&#8220;they&#8221; meaning Blacks). Really? Martin Luther 
  King, Jr. who wrote a book entitled &#8220;Why We Can&#8217;t Wait.&#8221; In 
  his letter from the Birmingham jail, April 16, 1963, he wrote, &#8220;Perhaps 
  it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to 
  say, &#8216;Wait.&#8217; But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers 
  and father at will and drowned your sisters and brothers at whim&#8230;&#8221; 
  etc., why wait more? As King then went on to say, &#8220;when you are forever 
  fighting a degenerating sense of &#8216;nobodiness&#8217;&#8230;then you will 
  understand why we find it difficult to wait.&#8221; Remember, that was 1963. 
  40 years ago. This is 2004. 40 years later. 140 years after the Emancipation 
  Proclamation. What possible excuse can the NFL still entertain other than covert, 
  defacto racism? 
<p>The modern NFL has been constructed on the backs of the Black players on the 
  field. And they are wonderfully delighted at that and at being paid handsomely, 
  so they are delighted to fulfill this role. But what about ownership? Management? 
<p>Emancipation was 140 years. As the kids say on long drives, &#8220;Are we there 
  yet?&#8221; We say to the NFL: its time. We are there. No more waiting. Time 
  to move Blacks into the ownership circle. The NFL is beginning to sound like 
  the good old White golfer guys of Augusta. But Augusta is private. The NFL lives 
  off tax payers and TV revenue money that sells commercials to ordinary Americans 
  not outfitted in bling. American cities need to stand up to the NFL&#8217;s 
  &#8220;Augusta syndrome.&#8221; 
<p>NFL football is the American game. It belongs to all Americans, not just owners 
  and players. The owners have a stewardship to exercise, not a right, an obligation 
  and duty to perform, not an entitlement. Its time for a Black owned team. We 
  know it. They know it. Not out of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; and a &#8220;hand 
  out,&#8221; but because it is right and way over due. What message is the NFL 
  sending its Black players by keeping Blacks out of ownership and management? 
  Aren&#8217;t they aware how this could impact their union negoatiations? Even 
  more astounding: why doesn&#8217;t the NFL care? 
<p>The Strib says Reggie is a millionaire. No other Black has come forward. That 
  must be just how White the block seems to be in the perceptions of wealthy Black 
  Americans. But Reggie Fowler has a vision, is bold, and is a Black millionaire. 
  From Strib reports appearently he and his associates all have some kind of NFL 
  experience. Again, what&#8217;s not to like? White millionaires have obviously been 
  allowed to leverage financially to purchase their NFL teams. Time to stop blocking 
  a Black millionaire from doing so.<br>

<p><strong>2/7/2005/#11: &#8220;Slavery and the Making of America,&#8221;<br>
  </strong><strong>PBS, Feb 9 &amp; 18</strong>. 
<p>Most take for granted that slavery was bad, unjust, and brutal. Too many think 
  that because fire hoses and dogs and lynching are no longer a part of the taken 
  for granted landscape, that the racism that enabled slavery is over. As the 
  Strib wrote in its 1990 series and as outlined in &#8220;the Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes,&#8221; racism is still with us. We haven&#8217;t seen this 
  program yet. But we like the title of the four parts of this practice that moved 
  from a piecemeal practice to a highly codified structured system, &#8220;1: 
  The Downward Spiral,&#8221; &#8220;2: Liberty is in the Air,&#8221; &#8220;3: 
  Seeds of Destruction,&#8221; and &#8220;4: The Challenge of Freedom.&#8221; 
<p>As terrible as it was, and it was terrible, it is all the more remarkable to 
  consider that for a system, slavery, that was a world wide phenomenon, that 
  it was the &#8220;least&#8221; dangerous and &#8220;least&#8221; oppressive 
  in the modern world of its day, in that here we reproduced ourselves whereas 
  in South American and the Caribbean, slaves were routinely worked to death, 
  replaced by more worker males imported from Africa (many more were sent to South 
  America and the Caribbean than to the US). 
<p>We will watch with interest and look for parallels to our inner city Minneapolis 
  situation and the lack of opportunity for our worker males. We haven&#8217;t 
  forgotten that both political parties participated in 1876 to break the promise 
  of Reconstruction, which began with freed Black slaves elected to Congress only 
  to devolve into the Democrats action, with Republcan acquiescence, to unleash 
  Ku Klux Klan terrorism in the South and Middle West. We will comment after each 
  show. For more on the economic consequences see The <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/appendd.htm" target="_blank">Economics

<p>We are interested solely in Minneapolis, and so we get involved in topics outside

  on issues we are covering regarding the gaps caused by racism in education,

  in particular, as it will be impacted by how we respond to the emergency regarding 
  our inner City Black Youth. For those who will want to follow-up on the Eason

<p><strong>2/6/2005/#9:</strong> <strong>We can solve the NFL&#8217;s lack of depth 
  in their managerial Black bench. Sell to Black Fowler.</strong> 
<p>NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the Rooney Rule (including Blacks in the 
  hiring interview) doesnt apply to the NFL office nor to team front offices. 
  He blames the lack of Blacks in executive positions due to the stranglehold 
  of White men on the top spots on the colleges and universities. 
<p><strong>Hey Paul: </strong>we offer a solution here in Minnesots. Instead of 
  conspiring to move the Vikings (See our Column #2 of January 26, 2005), help 
  Red sell the vikings to Reggie Fowler, a Black man, who will have no problem 
  finding and hiring Black talent and begin to develop the Black managerial bench 
  of the NFL. Then we will know you are serious.<br>

<p><strong>2/4/2005/#8. Why does truth continue to be a casualty of journalism?</strong> 
  <strong>CNN at Davos</strong> <br>
  It is said that there are two type of lies: lies of commission (purposefully, 
  intentionally) and the lies of omission (purposefully, intentionally). We would 
  add lies of selectivity, so that rather than get the truth, the whole truth 
  and nothing but the truth, we get perception masking truth. The great tragedy 
  is that most journalists of the &#8220;truth is my perception&#8221; school 
  of reporting, like the Star Tribune, actually believe what they say, and actually 
  can&#8217;t see the damage they cause with their &#8220;my perception is truth&#8221; 
  approach. <br>
  Followers of our columns, papers, and web log know that we always provide proof 
  of our statements, documents behind what we report. Even when we give the documents 
  to the Star Tribune, of which we have written before, they still often ignore 
  it because it doesn&#8217;t fit into their perception of truth. <br>
  Now we come to CNN and their news head, Eason Jordan. Over a week ago in Davos 
  Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum attended by major corporate leaders 
  (Bill Gates) and current and past heads of state (Bill Clinton), Eason said 
  that there were 12 journalists that were not only killed in Iraq by the U.S. 
  military, but were actually targeted for death. It has been over a week and 
  still we hear nothing about what should be the biggest story of the year. As 
  one blogger (www.hughhewitt.com) put it, CNN&#8217;s Eason Jordan slandered 
  the American military as journalist killers, and Main Stream Media doesn&#8217;t 
  care.&#8221; He answers the &#8220;why?&#8221; question with what is becoming 
  more and more obvious: that &#8220;this is a completely groundless and utterly 
  false slander,&#8221; meaning on purpose. <br>
  The official World Economic Forum blogger <a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2005/01/do_us_troops_ta.html" target="_blank">report</a> 
  is responded to by other bloggers. As blogger <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020917.php" target="_blank">Instapundit</a> 
  wrote &#8220;HAVING KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT on things he knew were true, it would 
  behoove Eason Jordan not to blather about things that he doesn&#8217;t know are true. 
  Really.&#8221; Also the Mineapolis based <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009414.php" target="_blank">Powerline</a> 
  also commented. <br>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/opinion/11JORD.html?ex=1107406800&en=462ccf8e77583a6d&ei=5070&oref=login" target="_blank">Jordan</a> 
  himself stated in 2003 that he didn&#8217;t report everything because of how 
  bad Saddam was and he felt journalists wouldn&#8217;t be safe if they reported 
  the truth. He also made a statement that he was waging peace and didn&#8217;t 
  want war and was afraid if he reported the truth Americans would want to invade.<br>
  Why won&#8217;t CNN report on Eason Jordan&#8217;s comments at Davos? Why won&#8217;t the 
  Star Tribune? When will CNN really wage peace rather than an Anti-American war 
  against ourselves? How many more will die and how many more will have to live 
  under tyranny because of the reporting like CNN&#8217;s? The absolute racism of CNN 
  and the so-called Main Stream Media means its OK for Arabs to live in tyranny 
  (and by the way, pay us a lot so we can live in luxury and enjoy the travel, 
  etc., to be voyeurs to report on murder and mayhem). Truth knows no ideology, 
  no party. Truth is not the servant of any news organization, newspaper, or blog. 
  It is ironic that as America tried to prevent war it gets sucked into it by 
  the likes of CNN. We are at war in Iraq for one other reason: the UN is so corrupt 
  that 3 of the 5 security council members could be bribed by the man who created 
  so many mass graves as CNN stood silently by, and prevented having the UN follow 
  its own resolutions, so Saddam thought he could do as he wanted. <br>
  No wonder America is confused by the war. After 9/11, what we all heard on CNN 
  differed from what we saw/read/heard in the world as the global war against 
  the terrorism unleashed by radical Islam struck places unrelated to the US, 
  as in Bali and Beslan. Ever since we heard Eason Jordan say CNN didn&#8217;t report 
  all it knew as America would then immediately want to invade, we have had this 
  lingering, sick feeling about CNN. We know some who no longer watch CNN for 
  this reason. Why does CNN continue to forfeit the truth and, in the process, 
  contribute to forfeiting of the lives of Ameican soldiers? And why does the 
  Star Tribune stay silent. Is the hatred of Bush so strong that it is allowed 
  to cause the deaths of more soldiers by encouraging the insurgent terrorist 
  to think that if they continue the US will leave and the country will be theirs 
  as key Americans are working so hard to restore Iraq to the terrorists? There 
  is no greater lie and conceit than to say you oppose the war but support the 
  troops. We lived through that lie in the 60s and watched how that lie extended 
  the war and resulted in thousands more killed. Our soldiers were a band of brothers. 
  The protesters and their journalist comrades were a band of widow makers.<br>
  We have written of seven areas in which we have serious problems that need dealing 
  with: the tremendous gaps in the inner city between Blacks and Whites in the 
  quality and value offered in education, jobs, housing, public safety, public 
  environment, governing, and ethics. Our book deals with all of these. The Star 
  Tribune ignores them. We have even offered solutions. None get traction. Why? 
  Because, as we also report in our book and in our web log, there is a higher &#8220;truth&#8221; involved: the racist lie that Blacks can&#8217;t make it on 
  their own as they are different (1968 liberal Kerner Commission Report) and 
  because they are not intelligent enough (1998 conservative The Bell Curve). 
  This is racism. 
<p>We see the same racism in the reporting of the global war with the terrorism 
  of radical Islam: that Arabs can&#8217;t handle democracy and freedom, that 
  they are not ready, that it won&#8217;t fit in with Islam, etc. Are these not 
  the same racist reasons that were given to condone slavery in the 18th century 
  and leave it as a legal institution in the Constitution? Isn&#8217;t this the 
  same racist reasoning behind the jim crow laws and the murders of young Blacks 
  like Emmit Till because &#8220;he should have known better&#8221; and known 
  &#8220;his place&#8221;, as White juries frequently let off men who admitted 
  their killings of Blacks?<br>
  We continue to club our Black kids in the inner city schools (Chapter 7, continue 
  non-compliance with employment rules inside Minineapolis (Chapter 9), and continue 
  to provide less procedures and financial instruments and places to live for 
  inner city Blacks than for Whites (Chapter 8). Policies make it much harder 
  for minorities to acquire assets, generate wealth. The Strib won&#8217;t report these 
  truths either. CNN or Strib, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference. They print their 
  perception of truth.<br>
  Racism is still powerful in this country. As Condaleeza Rice stated in 2003, 
  slavery was &#8220;America&#8217;s birth defect.&#8221; She lived through what 
  she has called &#8220;the home-grown terrorism&#8221; in Birmingham, Alabama. 
  In his Senegal Goree Island speech, President Bush stated that &#8220;many of 
  the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience&#8221; 
  of slavery.&#8221; Why did CNN&#8217;s Jordan countenance Saddam Hussein&#8217;s 
  slavery, and why did CNN&#8217;s Ted Turner and other senior executives countenance 
  it also? And why to the editors of the Star Tribune exercise the same lies of 
  omission in their reporting on education, jobs, and housing in the inner city 
  of Minneapolis that result in keeping young Black males &#8220;in their place&#8221;? 
  How much longer will truth continue to be a casualty and the only news fit to 
  print be their own blind perceptions?<br>
