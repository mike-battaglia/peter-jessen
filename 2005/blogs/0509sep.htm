<p><strong>9/24/2005 Blog #74:  Here we go again, swaggering going down 
  the &#8220;N&#8221; word road at Winter Park, with a letter &#8220;T&#8221; that stands for trouble. 
  </strong></p>
<p>In my preceding blog (9-20-05), the opening words are about the new Vikings 
  ownership, &#8220;A Minnesota Revival&#8221; and &#8220; a new day has dawned.&#8221; So why does the 
  Coach take us back in time down the &#8220;N&#8221; word road again?  For a guy who 
  played in the NFL, and has been a coach for a decade, he still shows that he 
  remains tone deaf when it comes to his players, and has no clue. </p>
<p>The papers have already reported that as Tice could not handle Randy Moss, 
  Red felt he had to get rid of one or the other, but felt getting rid of the 
  Coach during his attempts to sell the team was not a good idea.  So, to 
  bail out Tice and his wallet (we leave it to the reader&#8217;s imagination as to 
  which was more important to Red), he traded Randy.  But Tice still doesn&#8217;t 
  get it, as discussed in our web log entry #72, 9/19/200: &#8220;Fading Purple, 
  little pride.  The Vikings are being divided, not united&#8221; by this coach.</p>
<p>On my TV program of a year ago (late September 2004), I discussed the fact 
  that several players had told me that Coach Tice had used the &#8220;N&#8221; word.  
  Now we have this new story in the Pioneer Press Tuesday when it reported that 
  <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/12707897.htm" target="_blank">Tice 
  made it clear that his offense needs to regain its &#8220;swagger,&#8221; and &#8220;arrogance.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>Say what?  This illustrates why we say Tice is still tone deaf.  
  The players think they are playing football.  Tice seems to think it is &#8220;N - ball,&#8221; in the sense that he told the players last year that he wanted them 
  to &#8220;start acting like Ni**ers&#8221; and now, yesterday, as reported in the story 
  titled <strong>Righting the ship </strong>in yesterday&#8217;s Pioneer Press </p>
<p>What they need to regain is their football.  The Pioneer Press reports 
  that offensive players are insisting that <strong>they still are searching for 
  an &#8220;identity. </strong> Now we ask, isn&#8217;t this the coach&#8217;s 
  job?  Not swagger, not arrogance, not Ni**er ball, but rather plain old 
  football fundamentals: a strategically sound game plan, effective play calling, 
  an offensive line that is the key to executing the plays called, solid defense 
  at and behind the line, and a coaching staff that can teach their various players 
  to execute what they plan. </p>
<p>Recall the head doo rags and other gang-like paraphanalia on players allowed 
  and encouraged by Tice that his predecessor would not allow?  This &#8220;swagger&#8221; 
  line shows how much Tice has further taken his team further from football. The 
  team needs respect from a coach.  They need a coach who treats them as 
  men not as junior high kids needing mind games to get them motivated or the 
  apparel equivalent of secret agent rings or walking like peacocks, or, worse, 
  as interchangeable parts on his football plantation.  </p>
<p>We know Tice misreads his players.  We believe he is misreading his new 
  owner.  The Pioneer Press yesterday also reported that <strong>Despite 
  the dismal start, Tice said he knows that ownership &#8220;has his back.&#8221; 
  </strong>http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/12707897.htm </p>
<p>The players doubt he has their back.  The headline in Friday&#8217;s New York 
  Times says it all, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/sports/football/23nfl.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Mediocrity 
  Is Early Line in the N.F.C. North</a><strong>. </strong>The NYT reminds 
  us that &#8220;Tice was fined $100,000 by the league for scalping Super Bowl tickets.&#8221; 
   What the NYT leaves out is that Tice lied about it, to the team, to the 
  fans, and to the NFL, before the truth came out, as we covered in March.  
  Lying leads to the question of character, to the question of what else he lies 
  about, and to the question if the fact also is that players have left or want 
  to leave because Tice lies and doesn&#8217;t have their back.  </p>
<p>As we wrote in Blog entry #72, 9-19-05: </p>
<p>Martin Luther King talked about a man&#8217;s character being important, not his 
  color. We know Coach Tice is a crook and a liar. In our Column #6, March 23, 
  2005, we wrote: &#8220;Check these headlines. <strong>March 9: </strong> &#8220;Tice 
  denies scalping Super Bowl tickets.&#8221; <strong>March 10 </strong>: &#8220;Tice 
  is confident he&#8217;ll be cleared.&#8221; <strong>March 11: </strong> &#8220;Tice 
  says he scalped &#8216;05 tickets.&#8221; So he lies and denies; then, when he&#8217;s exposed 
  and fesses up, the Strib goes silent.&#8221; And now he blames his team. He has 
  a great Vikings machine. He just doesn&#8217;t know how to drive it. Liars don&#8217;t build 
  trust and confidence. </p>
<p>And that thought raises the question again of what is bothering Daunte Culpepper. 
   As we have written before, Daunte is a pro-bowler, future hall of famer, 
  and at the top last year in the NFL.  We&#8217;d like to know what is brewing 
  below the surface that has affected him and this team.  </p>
<p>In the recent film, &#8220;Coach Carter,&#8221; based on a true story, the coach would 
  not let his team use the &#8220;N&#8221; word.  He said using it showed they had no 
  respect for themselves, and players without respect for themselves can&#8217;t win. 
   Ditto clothing.  Tice&#8217;s predecessor was on that same page with 
  Coach Carter.  You never saw any of the clich&eacute; distractions Tice 
  encourages, as if doo rags and &#8220;N**er ball&#8221; will make them play better.  
  Which is why we consistently hear reports on the disrespect shown by Tice to 
  his players in his mistaken attempt to be one of them.  </p>
<p>Parents and coaches who try to be &#8220;one of them&#8221; with their kids or teams don&#8217;t 
  succeed.  Watching games on TV it is visible on the sidelines.  
  In &#8220;The Music Man,&#8221; there is a song called &#8220;Trouble,&#8221; about the game of pool, 
  which begins with &#8220;P&#8221; and rhymes with &#8220;T&#8221; and that stands for Trouble.  
  The T in Viking land is Tice.  And the trouble he brings to the team is 
  seen on the field.  </p>
<p>And with Tice using the N word in such a disparaging way, as if he was listening 
  to the worst of hip hop as if that represented Blacks (see our commentary, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/higherhopes.html" target="_blank">Higher 
  Hopes For Youth Than Hip Hop</a>), </p>
<p>it also means that his coaching staff had no problem with his use of the &#8220;N&#8221; 
  word, and that too has to make players wonder just wide spread that type of 
  thinking is.  So this problem is bigger and wider than that of just the 
  Head Coach. </p>
<p>And it continues:  we now learn from a post by the Strib 9-23 and dated 
  9-24, that discussions have been held regarding<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5632342.html" target="_blank"> 
  possibly trading Michael Bennett</a>. Did Michael stand up 
  to Tice?  Does he know more than they want told?  We know Randy 
  didn&#8217;t cotton to that kind of talk or behavior.  Is the staff cabal that 
  advised Red to do the Randy trade now taking that approach to Michael Bennett? 
   And is Daunte Culpepper next in their sights?  This brain trust 
  doesn&#8217;t seem to get the fact that anyone can lead followers.  NFL players 
  are leaders (or they wouldn&#8217;t have gotten this far).  It takes exceptional 
  men to play in the NFL, and it takes even moroe exceptional leaders of men to 
  lead them.  This is what the Vikings now lack. </p>
<p>Because of the confusion and the mixed signals and the use of terms that are 
  derogatory to a majority of his players, players are visibly upset here.  
  It would seem that the Vikings need a coach in the mode of a Tony Dungy or a 
  Marvin Lewis or a Romeo Crennel if they are to establish credibility again with 
  the players. <br>

<p><strong>9/20/2005 Blog #73:  The Vikings Plan for a Stadium Complex Offers 
  us a Minnesota Revival in the Spirit of New Orleans after Katrina.  Let 
  exciting progress reign.  Let there be an Economic Stimulus Enterprise 
  Zone along the new light rail line from Minneapolis to Blaine to St. Cloud, 
  and invite all to the prosperity and growth </strong><a href="../../solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm">table</a>.</p>
<p>I knew when I read the Star Tribune this morning that a new day has dawned 
  in Minnesota, an &#8220;aha&#8221; experience that came from reading four articles featuring 
  (1) Zygi Wilf, Vikings owner, (2) Donna Brazile, Black political leader whose 
  hometown is New Orleans and who served as Al Gore&#8217;s 2000 presidential campaign 
  manager, and (3) Simon Wiesenthal, who died today (Nazi hunter and life long 
  fighter against racism and anti-Semitism). </p>
<p>We have been waiting for this day.  We talked about our hope for it in 
  our columns #7 (April 6, 2005) and #8 (April 20, 2005), and in our Blog entries 
  #55 (May 13, 2005) and #66 (June 24, 2005), when we discussed the great possibilities 
  that could be ours in terms of jobs and prosperity for all, and especially for 
  the communities of color, if they only they would let us in the door of 9 projects 
  worth $5 billion that we discussed, especially those we long called would happen 
  along the Minneapolis-St. Cloud corridor, including the Vikings stadium in Blaine. 
   We have never opposed the corridor, only excluding people of color from 
  the contracting and the jobs.</p>
<p>We raised the question of why both Black and White leaders remain silent on 
  continuing the shutting out of minorities from contracts and jobs (see our book, 
  Chapter 9), as city, state, corporations, and so-called non-profit watchdogs 
  allow compliance laws to go unheeded.  We wrote about the race hustlers, 
  Black and White, who got theirs at the expense of our community, and of the 
  developers and contractors who did the same.  That was &#8220;Minnesota Nice&#8221; 
  at its discriminatory excluding best. </p>
<p>I see a new Moses for Minnesota in general and, in particular, for Minneapolis: 
   Zygi Wilf.  We saw a new dawn dawning in the headlines: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5625068.html" target="_blank">Wilf 
  unveils stadium plan</a>, as he announces <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5623854.html" target="_blank">Vikings 
  have deal for Blaine stadium</a>. </p>
<p>In the same paper, we have Donna Brazile&#8217;s article, in which she, a Democrat, 
  praised her political opponent as<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5623500.html" target="_blank"> 
  A leader with heart and a good plan.  I could not have been prouder 
  of Bush and his plan to empower those who lost everything.</a></p>
<p>We believe Zygi Wilf is cut from the same cloth.  He will facilitate 
  empowering everyone.  He is the son of  holocaust survivors.  
  He knows what it is to be a minority.  He knows the power of justice and 
  fair play.  And thus, as he announces his stadium complex, we also read 
  about Simon Wiesenthal, who died today at age 96, who himself was both a <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/5624499.html" target="_blank">holocaust 
  survivor and a Nazi hunter fighting racism and anti-Semitism</a>. </p>
<p>For reasons clearly outlined in my book, Minneapolis has refused to (1) undertake 
  the training and education needed for all students, giving minorities the gleanings 
  (while paying good salaries to the Black and White race hustlers running the 
  programs that club our seals, the kids in school, as all testing results show), 
  provide equality of access and opportunity in housing, and failed to follow 
  its own compliance laws in terms of including minorities in jobs. </p>
<p>I will seek to present a copy of my book to Zygi, welcome him to Minneapolis 
  and Minnesota, and invite him to join with those of us who seek justice and 
  fair play in jobs and hiring.  And if he has time, it would be an honor 
  to have him on my TV show. Indeed, the project he puts forth, when he includes 
  what we hope will also be training for Black youth, will do more to help significantly 
  reduce gang activity than all of the government programs put together. This 
  can be one of many possitive acts that can contribute <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">solutions</a> 
  to problems in our community.</p>
<p>This is why we call for making the North - South corridor from Minneapolis 
  to Blaine to St. Paul an Economic Stimulus Enterprise Zone.  It can have 
  as great a positive economic impact for us as the same designation will have 
  on New Orleans.  Costs can be cut by designating a zone, eliminating the 
  torturous delays of bureaucratic red tape, and allowing the projects to move 
  forward quickly. </p>
<p>And, by including the entire corridor beginning with Minneapolis in the Enterprise 
  Zone, it will also provide the kind of stimulus needed to offset problems foreseen 
  with constructing stadiums for the Twins and Gophers as well.  This would 
  not only be a win win for everyone, it would be savings savings for everyone 
  as well. </p>
<p>Those who are against supporting private enterprise with public monies are 
  on the wrong side of history.  It is government - private partnerships 
  that has enabled us to not only have roads for truckers and families and airlines 
  for freight and people, it is has also enabled us to unite to fight Hitler and 
  later the USSR in the cold war, to help end the tyranny of countries subjugating 
  their people and others, such as those that led to World War II, as well as 
  fighting other tyrannies and freeing other peoples before and since, as we stand 
  for democracy and freedom for everyone, as both JFK and W have said.</p>
<p>This is a new dawn for Minnesota.  All can have a place at this table 
  being set by Zygi.  He has invited all of us to sit with him.  There 
  is room for both parties in the legislature as well as county and city officials. 
  I look forward to the feast of jobs and the dessert of a winning football team 
  again.  Let us all join with Zygi and the rest of Minnesota to do for 
  ourselves what the Gulf region is doing for itself, and be glad we don&#8217;t have 
  to wait for a disaster to move us to action.  We thank Zygi for bringing 
  vision back to Minnesota (see my book, pp. 262-263).  We celebrate achieving 
  our goal of contributing to a self-defeating prophecy by exposing the plan (resignation?) 
  that the the Vikings would leave town, as encouraged by the Strib and it&#8217;s writer&#8217;s 
  book &#8220;Stadium Games.&#8221;  We pulled the covers back to expose them.  
  We take pride in having been able to do our small part to help derail those 
  who would have shipped the Vikings out of town (see my Chapter 15).  </p>
<p>Welcome Zygi, and Thanks.  You now have true dual citizenship, New Jersey 
  and Minnesota. <br>

<p><strong>9/19/2005 Blog #72:  Fading Purple, little pride.  The 
  Vikings are being divided, not united.  It is Monday morning quarterback 
  time.  </strong></p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s loss, 37 - 8, and a season start of 0 - 2, raises many intriguing 
  questions.  Moments like this before brought out media torrents against 
  the Black coach.  How is it that this White coach gets such a pass in 
  the media?  The former coach never lost the admiration, respect or confidence 
  of his players.  The current coach has.  We saw a team Sunday playing 
  with no fire, no enthusiasm, having lost their trust, respect, and confidence 
  in the coach.  </p>
<p>As we wrote in Blog #68, July 16, 2005, the current &#8220;brain trust&#8221; worked to 
  get rid of Randy Moss (so happy an event that the Strib carried six articles 
  about it on February 24, 2005).  We discussed this in the context of our 
  blog entry entitled, <strong>Mankato Charges Fans to Watch Vikings Practice. 
   What more surprises are in store for the new owner from his &#8220;loyal&#8221; 
  employees? </strong> The former Coach was their scapegoat.  Get 
  rid of him and all would be well.  It wasn&#8217;t.  So then Randy became 
  their scapegoat.  With him gone all would now be well.  It is not. 
   So now Daunte Culpepper is their scapegoat, as there are calls to replace 
  him.  If that occurs we would call that Dummy time, not Miller Time.</p>
<p>The current coach is supposed to have at least one specialty:  the offensive 
  line (he formerly coached it).  But the line is not protecting the quarterback. 
   The dummy coaching the line and the offense is a buddy of the coach. 
   Did the coach hire his buddy because so few others considered him a friend? 
   And thus on the local radio shows we are treated to those identifying 
  the newest scapegoat for the coaching incompetence:  Daunte:  that 
  Daunte is a dummy.  We think not.  We know not.  Daunte Culpepper 
  is a pro-bowler and future hall of famer who has proven himself for the past 
  six years.  Something else is causing the team to be in disarray, being 
  divided, not united.  The first buck stops on the Coach&#8217;s desk. </p>
<p>A quarterback can&#8217;t succeed with a weak offensive line and bad offensive play 
  calling.  The same dummies are calling both </p>
<p>And a team of many Black athletes sensitive to the plight of inner city Blacks, 
  finds it difficult to find pride in their work under a coach who, as reported 
  on my TV program, makes racial remarks.  His players, understandably, 
  don&#8217;t like it.  Add to that the fact that many Black players were upset 
  when he campaigned for the President and gave him a Vikings jacket.  </p>
<p>Now Coach Tice can campaign and vote for whoever he wants.  But knowing 
  many on his team don&#8217;t share his view, that was the act of a dummy.  Many 
  on the team believe, whether rightly or wrongly, that the mess up in New Orleans 
  after Katrina was due to indifference to Blacks.  And Katrina reminds 
  them that the cities are warehouses for poor Blacks for whom both the 1968 Kerner 
  Commission Report and &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221; book state Blacks are dummies, 
  not like others, can&#8217;t mke it, and thus have to be wards of the state. Katrina 
  exposed the raw results of these policies and beliefs.  </p>
<p>Thus the race comments of the coach I&#8217;ve discussed on my TV show, are not only 
  those of a dummy, they contribute to the dividing, not uniting, of the team, 
  contributing to the team going into a greater state of disarray.  Something 
  is eating away at the team.  Whatever it is, it has to be something at 
  Winter Park. </p>
<p>Martin Luther King talked about a man&#8217;s character being important, not his 
  color. We know Coach Tice is a crook and a liar. In our Column #6, March 23, 
  2005, we wrote: &#8220;Check these headlines. <strong>March 9:</strong> &#8220;Tice 
  denies scalping Super Bowl tickets.&#8221; <strong>March 10</strong>: &#8220;Tice 
  is confident he&#8217;ll be cleared.&#8221; <strong>March 11:</strong> &#8220;Tice says 
  he scalped &#8216;05 tickets.&#8221; So he lies and denies; then, when he&#8217;s exposed 
  and fesses up, the Strib goes silent.&#8221; And now he blames his team. He has 
  a great Vikings machine. He just doesn&#8217;t know how to drive it. Liars don&#8217;t build 
  trust and confidence.</p>
<p>Local radio shows are calling for the coach to shake things up.  He already 
  did.  Poorly.  It would appear that by the end of this season, we&#8217;ll 
  see real shaking up of coaches, executives, and scouts, for, as The Strib reported 
  September 11, 2005, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5607947.html" target="_blank">The 
  contract of every coach, football executive and scout expires before the start 
  of the 2006 season.</a>That makes the 
  need of their departure all the more critical:  if they perform this way 
  in the last months of their contract, how much more poorly will they perform 
  once they have a contract and guarantees? </p>
<p>There are those among this &#8220;loyal&#8221; staff that worked hard to turn 
  Red McCombs against Coach Green.  And now that Tice&#8217;s predecessor is gone, 
  did it get better? No, it has gotten worse.  Now it is time for the real 
  dummies to depart. How much wool did they think they could pull over the eyes 
  of the new owner?  As we wrote July 16, &#8220;Welcome Zygi, welcome to &#8216;Minnesota 
  Nice.&#8217;&#8221;  The Vikings ship is in a storm.  And we all know that ships 
  go down when they lack either a helmsman altogether or one who doesn&#8217;t know 
  how to navigate. <br>

<p><strong><a name="0571b0909" id="0571b0909"></a>2005 Blog #71:  Is there a difference between Quarantine camps, 
  detention camps, and Hurricane Katrina refugee camps?  Are they guests 
  of the government, recipients of the compassion of their fellow citizens, or 
  are they indentured, dependent  on the state?</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Minneapolis City Charter, Chapter 14, Section 5: </strong><br>
  ( emphasis added )  </p>
<blockquote class="style3">
  <p>When practicable, <strong>each person taken into quarantine or stations and 
    receiving the aid and care afforded thereby shall pay a sum of money sufficient 
    to meet all expenses, </strong> labor and care incurred in that person&#8217;s behalf, 
    which money shall be faithfully kept, reported and counted for by physicians, 
    health officers or other persons in charge of said quarantine or station. 
     (As amended, 83-Or-234, &sect; 13, 9-30-83)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to know if this applies to the incoming evaculees/refugees.  
  We also want to know to whom it will apply in the future. Here is how we wrote 
  of it in 2002 in our book, <em>The Minneapolis Story, </em> p. 268 (emphasis 
  added): </p>
<p>During the national police chief convention in town, the Somalis demonstrated 
  because of the lack of jobs for Blacks.  </p>
<p>I then raised the question of <strong>the Quarantine Plan </strong>.  
  This is part of a bill the Minnesota Legislature marked up in February as <strong>part 
  of the House Crime Prevention Bill </strong>.  This bill <strong>authorizes 
  detention camps be set up in state parks.  The plan also calls for making 
  anyone quarantined to pay back the state for any expenses of the quarantine 
  </strong>.  So if there is a biological attack, those quarantined could 
  possibly lose their houses if they have to repay the state.  They all 
  denied knowing anything about it, and yet I knew from the February meeting at 
  the capital that the Mayor and Police Chief knew.  Any attack would obviously 
  be centered on the city as opposed to the suburbs or rural areas.  <strong>That 
  means Blacks in the inner city forced to repay the city and state for quarantine 
  costs would be fully and completely impoverished </strong></p>
<p>The refugees are being dispersed from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrinia 
  because those homes still standing are contaminated by the disease and toxins 
  of human and chemical waste.  In other words, biological.  Therefore, 
  is the state of Minnesota mandated, by its own law, to make them pay?  
  If so, will the state rescind this law?  Will the city? </p>
<p>Because it is so relevant for the foreseeable future, we will concentrate in 
  this Blog on <strong>(1) </strong> the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as it 
  relates to inner city poor, <strong>(2) </strong> how Hurricane Katrina has 
  exposed the fact that &#8220;The Minneapolis Story&#8221; is also &#8220;The New Orleans &#8220; story 
  and the story of most American inner cities, and <strong>(3) </strong> on what 
  it will all mean for those being relocated, such as the 3,000 victims of Hurricane 
  Katrina arriving to live at our own Camp Ripley, and to the communities to which 
  they are being sent in Miinnesota as well as others across the country.</p>
<p>Is Camp Ripley a refugee camp?  A detention camp? A Quarantine camp? 
   A combination?  </p>
<p>For over two years a main concern of mine has been to try to get the quarantine 
  laws on the books repealed because they were purposefully aimed at Black people. 
   In previous 2005 columns (#s 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14) and Blog entries 
  of 2005 (#51, 53-55, 60-61, 63, and 67), we have talked about the fact that 
  such laws/statutes are on the books.  What has been the most frustrating 
  is that the most recent call for rounding up those Blacks not approved of, and 
  put in detention camps (gang  members <strong>and </strong> their friends 
  and families), came last June from the Black who heads the St. Paul Department 
  of Civil Rights in his &#8220;open letter&#8221; to the community, in which he 
  condemned young Black men involved in gangs along with all of their family members 
  and friends, as if, as a group, they should be rounded up and put in detention 
  camps. </p>
<p>There are many questions to ask.  Our concern in our book and web site 
  has been the city of Minneapolis.  We have written of the corruption in 
  the government and Black organizations of Minneapolis.  Now we see it 
  in the corruption of New Orleans.  And what about the fact that Louisiana 
  and Mississippi are two of the most corrupt states in the union, having the 
  most judges and officials and cops in jail indicted?  It sounds 
  like the area is run like the UN Oil for Food program, only here it seems to 
  be oil for corruption in the city of New Orleans.  </p>
<p>So we ask again, as in Blog #69, why did the mayor and other local authorities 
  allow buses to be submerged rather than used to evacuate?  Why were hundreds 
  of the New Orleans police department not only not accounted for participating 
  in the looting?  Why, knowing the Super Dome was to be their holding area, 
  didn&#8217;t the Mayor and other officials have food, water, or security at the ready 
  for those they knew would be sent there? </p>
<p>Let us spell out our concerns with12 questions illustrating our concerne for 
  for the victims of Hurricane Katrina now and in the future:  </p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong> Will the state and city renounce as their policy foundation 
  the current beliefs of liberals and conservatives that Blacks can&#8217;t make it 
  on their own and thus must remain wards of the state (liberal Kerner Commission 
  Report of 1968; conservative book The Bell Curve in 1998)? </p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>Will those at Camp Ripley be charged for their stay?  
  If not, won&#8217;t that be breaking the law? </p>
<p><strong>(3) </strong> Is this a precursor to the roundups urged for Black youth?   </p>
<p><strong>(4) </strong> Will the 3,000 be examined ahead of time for communicable 
  diseases that could have been contracted in the polluted waters of the flood, 
  the only reason for legitimately quarantining them (and then only until healthy)?</p>
<p><strong>(5) </strong> Will the 3,000 be screened in terms of any serious criminal 
  behavior?  The New Orleans murder rate is 10 times the national average, 
  and according to the New Orleans police web page, 4,668 violent crimes were 
  committed in the city in 2004, which doesn&#8217;t count the many non-violent ones. 
   Is this a Cuba like dispersal to send &#8220;undesirables&#8221; elsewhere?  
  And why, when FEMA does not deploy local police nor activate the National Guard, 
  and the military can&#8217;t come in without the Governor&#8217;s request, why didn&#8217;t the 
  local mayor and state governor follow the plan in place for dealing with what 
  was understood would be a large amount of looting as part of any major storm 
  aftermath? </p>
<p><strong>(6) </strong> Is this a way to disburse Blacks from choice real estate 
  so they don&#8217;t come back, as has happened with the Hollman project in our fair 
  city?  Why not give the poorrest victims <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/housing_the_poo.html" target="_blank">rent 
  vouchers</a> by expaning the HUD &#8220;Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher 
  Progdram, which is <a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005445.html" target="_blank">a 
  big improvement over the failed government housing projects they replaced</a>, 
  as rental properties nationwide have a 10% vacancy rate (12-15% in the south 
  central region), instead of rounding them up in refugee camps? </p>
<p><strong>(7) </strong> What will be done in terms of educating the kids?  
  Will charter schools be allowed if the public schools can&#8217;t handle it?  
  And if the public schools can&#8217;t will their political clout be allowed to prevent 
  education structures that will work if the teachers&#8217; unions don&#8217;t agree?  
  And if that happens will the refugee camps become spawners of more anger and 
  crime as occurs with youth in Middle East refugee camps? </p>
<p><strong>(8) </strong> As kids follow examples, will the refugees themselves 
  be hired and organized to handle the dispersing of food and supplies to all 
  of the refugees or will it be done by well meaning Whites such that they undermine 
  further the authority of and respect for adults in the eyes of the children 
  in these refugee camps? In other words, will the positions needed to be filled 
  to handle the organization and administration of the camp be decided by the 
  refugees and use the refugees themselves, or will they be left so idle because 
  of the do-gooders from the outside that anger and unlawful activity occurs among 
  the young? </p>
<p><strong>(9) </strong> And if so, is this but another way to put Blacks &#8220;in 
  their place&#8221; and raise another generation for the the culture of despair tht 
  is the culture of dependency on government?  </p>
<p><strong>(10) </strong>Will the State of Minnesota and the City of Minneapolis 
  come out and state, unequivocally and categorically, that this is not a quarantine, 
  that the refugees will not be charged for any part of their stay, and that plans 
  will be made and immediately enacted, within 10 days, to enroll everyone in 
  either a training course or other courses in order to prepare them to be productively 
  absorbed into the life of a rebuilt New Orleans or into the life of another 
  community or town? </p>
<p><strong>(11) </strong> Will the State of Minnesota and the City of Minneapolis 
  come out and state, unequivocally and categorically, that these &#8220;you pay for 
  your quarantine laws&#8221; will be repealed? </p>
<p><strong> (12) </strong>Will the State of Minnesota and the City of Minneapolis 
  come out and state, unequivocally and categorically, that they will repeal the 
  detention camp plans as discussed in my Column #9 of May 4, 2005, especially 
  the detention plan for Blacks by Hennepin County district court Judge Lindsay&#8217;s 
  Plan of 1971 and 1972? <br>

<p><strong><a name="0569b0907"></a>9-7-2005 #69:  Huricane Katrina blew back the covers showing 
  how The Minneapolis Story is also The New Orleans Story. </strong></p>
<p>The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will be a tipping point.  Which way 
  and on who will it fall? <strong>Watch for bias in the media. </strong> 
  See these <a href="http://www.blacknews.com/images/looters-finders2.jpg" target="_blank">photos</a> 
  with captions of whites &#8220;finding&#8221; food and Blacks &#8220;looting&#8221; food.  We 
  don&#8217;t condone looting.  But we also don&#8217;t condone the looting of the good 
  name of Blacks by such obvious racist reporting.  See the bias also in 
  the Strib online headline of story 9-2-05, stating that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/125/5593021.html" target="_blank">Troops 
  arrive to take back New Orleans</a>, as if Blacks had taken over the 
  city.  This is how their fear of Blacks twists their reporting and helps 
  explain their constant negative slants reporting on Blacks in Minneapolis. </p>
<p><strong>And look for the Blame Game to be a cover local incompetence.  
  </strong>A visible sign of the local incompetence in New Orleans is seen in 
  these <a href="http://junkyardblog.net/archives/week_2005_08_28.html#004752" target="_blank">pictures 
  of parked, unmobilized busses</a> less than a mile from the Superdome.  As noted before, TV news showed 
  up to 500 busses that could have evacuated the people.  This was a local 
  responsibility, and they failed. </p>
<p><strong>Be clear the differences: </strong> <strong>(1) </strong> there 
  is a difference between those who were unable to leave and those who could but 
  refused to leave.  <strong>(2) </strong> There is also a difference between 
  a government that orders people to leave and provides the means to do so and 
  one that orders them to leave and then provides no means to do so for those 
  unable to leave.  Check out this <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/katrina_/2005/09/paying_the_price_of_feckless_local_government.php" target="_blank">photo 
  of more unused city owned buses</a>. City 
  officials did not use them to evacuate people; they just let them sit there. 
   Other reports suggest that, in two locations, were 400-500 busses.  
  Instead of using the busses, the Black mayor fell back on race baiting:  
  it was the White man&#8217;s fault.  Contrast that with the behavior of New 
  York&#8217;s mayor after 9/11.  And instead of acting, the female Louisiana 
  Governor cried.  This is not good enough of either of  them.  
  We are a democracy, with the locals in charge, helped by the state, and then 
  by the feds only when called in by the state (which waited until Tuesday to 
  do so).  After 9/11 we have all seen people wearing first responder hats 
  of the NYPD and NYFD hats.  Ever see anyone wear a FEMA hat?  </p>
<p><strong>The Govenor has much to answer for. </strong> On &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; 
  9-4-05, the Black Mayor of New Orleans expressed his frustration that the White 
  female governor refused help from the feds under the &#8220;posse comatatis laws&#8221; 
  (<a href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/cc/baker1.html" target="_blank">the 
  Posse Comatatis Act of 1787</a>) the federal government cannot by law 
  send federal troops or National Guardsman from other states into the area unless 
  the state specifically asks for it.  The governor cried tears yet refused 
  to ask for help until Tuesday.  She and her entire state staff show incompetence 
  at its worse.  The President declared the Gulf Coast a disaster area on 
  Saturday, the weather service predicted the storm shift, and she waited until 
  Tuesday to call for help.  The mayor&#8217;s complaints, though valid, don&#8217;t 
  answer why he didn&#8217;t order the city&#8217;s buses to make evacuation runs. </p>
<p><strong>TV exposed the local incompetence:</strong>  CNN, MSNBC, Fox 
  and other stations must have shown the busses parked in the bus yard in New 
  Orleans many, many times that could have been used for evaculation but were 
  not.  Why not Mr. Mayor?  Why not Madame Governor?  How can 
  the feds help if the city and state don&#8217;t use the assets they have and refuse 
  to ask the feds help (without which they cannot come in)?  Is this why 
  you bash the feds, to cover up your own incompetence?  </p>
<p><strong>Local and states&#8217; rights/responsibility or not? </strong> Knowing 
  the reality that the levees would only repel a Category 3 storm, why didn&#8217;t 
  the state and city politicians come up with the money?  To design/build 
  for Category 4 or 5 would have cost $2.5 billion.  The Louisiana state 
  government budget is $18 billion.  As they have been waiting since the &#8220;cuts&#8221; started under Carter 30 years ago, why not tax themselves to save themselves? 
   That would be $83 million/year, or .46% (half a percent additional tax, 
  which could have been paid by adding half a cent to tourists).  </p>
<p><strong>LA and NO undermine federalism. </strong> Louisiana and New Orleans 
  sound like they want a centralized national government.  If so, state 
  legislatures and city councils are not needed.  They can go home and just 
  wait for the local National Administrator to tell them what to do.  If 
  not, step up, look at the priorities, take the initiative, and legislate/tax 
  accordingly.  There is nothing sadder and more hopeless than to see state 
  and local officials so reduced in their pork barreling civic styles that they 
  can&#8217;t adjust to real change and instead drop the ball and wait for the feds 
  to pick it up and tell them what to do rather than taking the initiative and 
  taking action.  </p>
<p><strong>When the debate settles down to the hurricane and everything else being 
  the fault of just One Man, </strong> we are saying we are not responsible for 
  the safety of ourselves or our loved ones, and that we want The Man to come 
  and make it better.  The world tried that for millenia under kings and 
  emperors.  France tried it under Napoleon.  Russia tried it under 
  Lenin, Stalin, and Stalin wannabes (Putin).  Germany tried it under Hitler. 
   China tried it under Mao.  Cambodia under Pol Pot.  Vietnam 
  under Ho Chi Minh (sorry, Jane, but why do you want us praying on our knees 
  for one of them to rule us?).  </p>
<p><strong>Are we individuals or merely political cogs for the city plantation 
  master? </strong> As Blacks of African slave descent, we have allowed 
  ourselves to be dependent on the city plantation masters since the 60s, and 
  all the while cursing them for making it so and cursing ourselves for allowing 
  it. Let us let Katrina inspire us to find our voice again.  It is time 
  that we stand as men in our own right and it is time the wannabe MLKs remember 
  what MLK said:  those of us not qualified, including our kids in the schools, 
  <strong>are </strong><strong>qualifyable</strong>, and the continued turning 
  of their backs by so-called Black leaders in the face of the poorest quality 
  in America education, poorest jobs, poorest housing, and poorest public safety, 
  is a scorge and plague upon our people by our people.  We need a Category 
  5 clean up of the NAACP, the Urban League, and all city political machines that 
  provide our Black cubs with only the worst of inner city education, their parents 
  the worst of inner city jobs, and their families the worst of inner city housing.   </p>
<p>3,000 refugees of New Orleans will be at Ft. Ripley, Mn.  Other thousands 
  will be re-located elsewhere In this country.  Let us make this a time 
  to really start over, not roll over and wait for assistance. </p>
<p><strong>Let us remember that Nellie Stone Johnson </strong> (See Interlude 
  3 of my book) was opposed to state centered liberalism and a state political 
  party in control.  She wanted local, bottom up liberalism by members of 
  the communty.  She worked as a seamstress all of her life to remain independent. 
   She fought for equal access and equal opportunity for the people of every 
  community so that they could work and learn and do well in their own communities. 
   She believed in freedom and property rights.  Her issues were education, 
  jobs, housing and health care.  All of these issues were back burnered 
  in New Orleans by Black leaders sucking up to and living off the corrupt political 
  system, just as they have in Minneapolis, as outlined in my book, <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/pages/order.htm" target="_blank">The 
  Minneaopolis Story, Through My Eyes.</a></p>
<p><strong>And why the joy of describing New Orleans as a 3 rd world country? 
  </strong> Do we hate ourselves that much?  NOLA looks like that 
  because of Katrina, not because of corrupt dictators.  And the difference 
  is that NOLA will not long look like that while 3 rd world countries will continue 
  to look like that every day they are ruled by dictators.  This is a huge 
  difference.  And it is why we say that not only Blacks from our civil 
  war days should be free, but all peoples of the world over should be free, and 
  we should help them make that move.  Or how else can we complain about 
  our ancestors forced slavery or the Jim Crow laws, if we are willing to stand 
  by silently while others remain enslaved, or, worse, spend time enjoying the 
  dictators of our people in Africa, as the NAACP does, which is why we say that 
  <a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">the NAACP has 
  taken its eyes off the prize</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So let us, together, rethink policies toward our inner cities,
  and, in particlar, our minority inhabitants in them, who are controlled by one 
  party and their favorite unions (government workers unions and teachers unions), 
  the NAACP and Urban League, that foster maintaining a culture of dependency 
  on a government run by a single party, and see how what we have said is true: 
   The Minneapolis Story is also The New Orleans Story, The Detroit Story, 
  The Newark Story, etc.  Katrina has pulled back the covers to expose this 
  reality. </p>
<p><strong>What to do? </strong> Our advice remains the same: read <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com/pages/order.htm" target="_blank">The 
  Minneaopolis Story, Through My Eyes</a><strong>,</strong> especially our summary 
  of solution suggestions in Chapter 17, and our <a href="../../tocsolutions.htm">Solutions
