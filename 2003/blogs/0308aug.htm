<p><strong><a name="03117b0831"></a>Blog #117. August 31, 2003: Doug Grow: We hardly know ye. We thought 
  we saw a breakthrough with your column “Whebbe, Jr., Short on Money, Long on 
  Dreams.”</strong></p>
<p>Then we looked again and realize that you did not write “The Minneapolis Story: 
  Short on Money, Long on Dreams” (http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/4049064.html) 
  about my book, as I point out how the city has shorted itself the money for 
  dream building for people who still have dreams in order to fulfill the city’s 
  dreams to make Minneapolis the “last outpost” for showing other cities how to 
  keep Blacks in their place. But I should have known, as you already told my 
  publisher that the Strib wouldn’t be covering my book, that it was “shelved,” 
  because there were more important topics to cover. So, how is this story or 
  others you have written since my book came out more important than an objective, 
  fact filled book about the problems of Minneapolis with real world recommendations 
  for how to resolve them? You were given a copy of the book, as six other editors 
  and columnists for the Strib. Can you really look me in the eye after reading 
  Chapter 17, Interlude 4, and the conclusion, and tell me with a straight face 
  that this is not an important story: 40 year community activist writes book 
  on history of city’s response to minorities, particularly in light of the Strib 
  series on racism in 1990? How can this not be news? How can this not at least 
  be community news? Shame on you. Shame on the Star Tribune. Maybe you should 
  be called &#8220;The Downtown Business, Cultural Arts, Education, Sports and Suburban 
  Tribune.&#8221; How about &#8220;Any Place But The Inner City Tribune?&#8221; What communities 
  do you cover now? What could be more important that “The Minneapolis Story” 
  in any of its guises? Have you no pride? No shame?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #116. August 30, 2003: Braun Intertec: The Fox guarding the hen 
  house, the wolf dressed in grandma’s clothes welcoming little red riding hood</strong></p>
<p>Remember that Braun Intertec was contracted to do the cleaning of the ground 
  soils and water at Hollman/Heritage Park. Then they are brought in to evaluate 
  their work and have the analysis done in-house, in their own laboratory. Yet 
  the state of Minnesota itself has questioned the integrity of the testing, as 
  Braun Intertec has a very serious conflict of interest. So the independent analysis 
  we were promised was not done. They claimed it was OK before they cleaned it 
  up so now they couldn’t see it. They had already concluded what they would see 
  in advance, and thus gave us an incorrect report. We can only surmise that they 
  purposefully covered it up as they knew they didn’t clean it before and they 
  hoped by continuing to deny anything was wrong that the story would die down 
  and people’s attention would be attracted to something else, and they could 
  get back to business as unusual. Now, if you, dear reader, like them, had been 
  given millions of dollars to do the cleanup, what would you do if you found 
  toxins? Would you risk big fines and/or jail and/or going out of business, or 
  would you cover it up and hope it blows over, as one way is a sure loss and 
  the other way is a maybe escape? As in the cartoon of the fox and the hen house, 
  the most oft used strategy is used: deny, deny, deny. No sir, Mister Farmer, 
  those white things are not chicken bones, nosirreebob. They are small bleached 
  corn cobs. And no no, those are not empty stalls; those are the hen house shadows 
  playing tricks on your eyes. Chicken bones. Oh my goodness, no, no, no, not 
  chicken bones. And then the fox walks away, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>The City is bereft of professional integrity (as Braun Intertec has already 
  shown itself to be) by not insisting on an outside, independent test. Isn’t 
  the normal protocol to have independent tests? Of course. But to date neither 
  the city nor the developers and their hired hands have followed this. Fortunately, 
  Minneapolis also resides in Minnesota which in turn resides in the United States. 
  If necessary, we’ll have to bring in the state environmental people, the US 
  Environmental Protection Agency, and, quite possibly, the U.S. Attorney. We 
  will not become the next set of bones in the fox’s hen house nor will be allow 
  ourselves to wind up in the belly of the wolf.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #115. August 29, 2003: Playing the race card. Don’t forget, Whites 
  created the deck and Whites have been dealing the race cards to us for over 
  300 years. Now we are playing them.</strong></p>
<p>Some have asked me if my use of the term “racist” is playing the race card? 
  That question always means there is no racism involved, meaning whatever is 
  wrong is somehow innately the fault of Blacks. I repeat: I play with the race 
  cards but I didn&#8217;t deal them. There is a difference. The whole history of the 
  Hollman/Heritage Park site, along with “crime containment” neighborhoods, lousy 
  education, prevention of jobs and ghettoes of indecent housing are all among 
  the playing cards in the deck dealt by Whites? Indeed, my whole book “The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes” is all about how Whites have long been dealing the race 
  card (slavery, Jim Crow, 1968 Blacks can’t make it on their own Kerner Commission 
  Report, local laws and regulations, etc.). They dealt us the cards. We&#8217;re just 
  playing the hand we have been given. I guess they don’t think that when we play 
  we can count cards. Newsflash: we can count. Are there Blacks who play cards 
  not in the deck? Of course. But those few playing nonexistent cards doesn’t 
  make the real cards go away. To make the real deck go away so there are no more 
  race cards, real or imaginary, implement my solution process in Chapter 17 of 
  my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.”</p>

<p><strong>Blog #114. August 29, 2003: Report hidden until given the light of 
  day in Wednesday’s column. How many more?</strong></p>
<p>In my Wednesday, August 27, 2003 column in the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, 
  I wrote that the August 7, 2003 report I discussed had been kept quiet. No coverage 
  by the Star Tribune. Can you imagine a report dismissing arsenic as “common” 
  and nothing being said? Then after “common” they say the amount in the water 
  to be a health risk is not established. Are you doing the math with me here? 
  Do you “commonly” have arsenic in your water? And if is was present would you 
  take the word of someone who said it was not a risk when they themselves have 
  no idea what is healthy and what is not? In this age of almost environmental 
  obsession, no one knows the dangerous levels of arsenic? And yet we all know 
  that any level of consumption of something like Arsenic will, over time, be 
  fatal, especially for babies and children? Still to come: the results of tests 
  taken by other experts among whom there is a consensus that if children put 
  their fingers in this stuff at Hollman/Heritage Park, and then put their fingers 
  in their mouths, it will be toxic for them.</p>
<p>Remember my web log entry #44, #62, and #102, where I reported how they cemented 
  up the black ooze coming up through the sidewalk cement? They left that out 
  of their report too. At the August 14 meeting where they gave their report they 
  were asked about that ooze. They said it was not petroleum based. But they knew 
  it was petroleum. They cemented over it so there was “nothing” there. Before 
  they did the ooze had eaten through the concrete and was powerful enough to 
  leave it stained even after scrubbing to try to get rid of it. The report does 
  not indicate that they ever took any samples of this black goo before they cemented 
  it up. But I did take a sample first. So I know, proof positive, that it is 
  petroleum based, which fits with the description in the July 31-August 6, 2003 
  cover story of the Spokesman-Recorder showing the map of all the contamination 
  sites in North Minneapolis. In counting the dots on Hollman (inside or at the 
  boundary of the site) I counted 43 dots representing contamination sites. The 
  area between Hollman and the Mississippi and going North and South a dozen blocks 
  each way has, on the map, over 300 dots representing contamination sites. And 
  in the small section of the map representing the East side of the Mississippi 
  there are dots representing 24 contamination sites. This is a far bigger story 
  than just Hollman/Heritage Park. And yet McCormack Baron Salazar and the City 
  of Minneapolis continue to play their games with us. And the Star Tribune remains 
  silent. As I said in the title of Wednesday’s column, <i>A LITTLE BIT OF POISON 
  IS OK; AFTERALL, THESE ARE ONLY BLACK CHILDREN.</i> Some have objected to that 
  line as &#8220;playing the race card.&#8221; But who dealt the Hollman/Heritage Park card? 
  I&#8217;m playing with the deck Whites have dealt from. I guess they dont&#8217; think we 
  can count cards. But we can. And so can the feds. I wonder how long the city, 
  and McCormack Baron Salazar, and Braun Intertec think they can cover this up 
  before the feds come down on them?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #113. August 28, 2003: This is the day, August 28, the 40th Anniversary 
  of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” Speech</strong></p>
<p>Read excerpts from the <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm#i">“I 
  Have a Dream”</a> speech or my longer paper <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm">&#8220;The 
  Unfinished Dream&#8221;</a> in honor of this day in the &#8220;Solution Papers&#8221; 
  section of this web site. </p>
<p>What is important is not what we do today but what we do tomorrow. What will 
  you do? I’ll keep working on the “solutions” of Chapter 17 of the book “The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.”</p>
<p>As Bob Dylan was wont to say, “the times they are a-changin.” Hispanics now 
  outnumber Blacks. In California Whites are a minority, outnumbered by Blacks 
  and Hispanics and Asians. More than ever, we need the message of Martin Luther 
  King: judge others by the content of their character not the color of their 
  skin. Too many young firebrands on that balcony in 1968 did not pick up his 
  torch to shed light but to light their way to riches. Too many became racketeering 
  extortionists of Whites and snake oil salesmen to fellow Blacks. Too many Hispanics 
  and Asians and other immigrants have picked up our separatist cry of specialness, 
  and now a whole chorus drowns out “not color of skin but content of character.” 
  In our drive to use our color to glorify rainbows, multiculturalism, and diversity, 
  we have changed E pluribus unum, out of many one, to many out of many, a veritable 
  Tower of Babel that has forsaken principles and conscience and unity for false 
  honor codes and separateness, for paranoia and fear, and the impoverishment 
  and disempowerment of Blacks in inner city ghettos.</p>
<p>And so these old leaders (Black and White democrats) with their old solutions 
  double cross our children by forcing them to stay in the Democrat’s union schools 
  when most Black parents favor choice, defined as vouchers so they can choose 
  good schools. But choice is what Whites want for themselves, not for us. Too 
  many Black democrats have joined too many White Democrats and White unions to 
  thumb their noses at the wisdom of Nellie Stone Johnson: “No education, no jobs, 
  no housing” in the inner cities. These “leaders” keep their jobs but deny generation 
  after generation of our kids a chance to learn so they can get jobs too.</p>
<p>They club our cubs (see Chapter 7 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes). And so we hear the Black lips of Black preachers and legislators and 
  the Black lips of elected Black officials and their bureaucrats cry out “wait, 
  for it will take generations.” Martin Luther King denied that argument to Whites. 
  He would be appalled at how many Blacks have learned that song and sing its 
  chorus of “wait.” Thus the racism we decried 40 years ago remains, but now its 
  the racism of Black leaders against Blacks, as they are unable and unwillingn 
  to let us go as they benefit economically by running the Democrats inner city 
  plantations. And then they wonder why so few showed up for the 40th anniversary 
  gathering in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>I’ve been at this for 40 years, inspired by Dr. King 40 years ago. And what 
  do I see: a movement that has descended into the pitiful celebration of malice 
  at the Lincoln monument. It was no better than this year’s annual meeting of 
  the NAACP (see “NAACP Takes Eye Off Prize” in the “Solution Papers” section 
  of this web site). The Civil Rights Movement was and is supposed to be a movement 
  of Democrats and Republicans and Independents and Greens sharing a similar goal. 
  Instead we saw a cheer leading squad for partisan Democrats, and instead of 
  trashing racism and false leaders it trashed the country and all non-Democrats 
  (except Congressman John Lewis). That is not civil rights. That is uncivil free 
  speech. Constitutionally protected, to be sure, but to a Nellie Stone Johnson 
  democrat, political suicide.</p>
<p>Racial harmony, integration, equal access and equal opportunity are not the 
  platforms of a single party but the ideal of all fair minded Americans, of any 
  color or party or “persuasion,” seeking fairness and justice. Lincoln and King 
  shared “with malice toward none.” This is why, in Chapter 5, I focus on the 
  Golden Rule. To many national and local civil rights leaders seek gold to rule 
  instead of working with other golden relationships. The movement has lost its 
  way. Many Independents, Conservatives and Greens share our goal of freedom’s 
  prize of racial equality, i.e., equal access, equal opportunity. And polls show 
  that most Blacks feel the most important Black leader in America is Colin Powell, 
  a Republican, with 25% of Blacks under 30 calling themselves independent, not 
  Democrat or Republican.</p>
<p>So, do we wait? No. Will we trash America? No. Will we keep clubbing our cubs? 
  No. Will we ridicule Whites and Blacks and Asians? No. Will we criticize all 
  who stand against equal access, equal opportunity, whether Democrat or Republican, 
  Independent or Green, male or female, straight or gay, ethnic or religious? 
  Yes. The rainbow was a sign to end destruction. Today’s “rainbow coalitions” 
  use it to create destruction. Read my paper “The Unfinished Dream” in the “Solution Papers” section of his web site, a paper that honors Dr. King. Read the truth 
  as spoken by Martin Luther King, Jr., truth that still stands today. We can 
  solve it now if we want to. I want to. Don’t you? Let that be our continuing 
  dream.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #112. August 26, 2003: Is Lois Everheart in danger of being voted 
  off the island? </strong></p>
<p>At the Thursday meeting last week, she said Ken Havey was a liar when Ken said 
  that a couple of years ago they had spent $4 million in clean up. Lois, who 
  heads infrastructure care for MPHA, said that had not been done. The following 
  Monday she claimed to have no recollection of saying that. I would vote all 
  the liars off the island.</p>

<p>The question will not go away, Do we do it now or wait generations? See #106 
  and #109 below. In “The Unfinished Dream” in the “Solution Papers” section 
  of this Minneapolis Story web site, Martin Luther King, Jr. says do it now, 
  and explains why we can’t wait. This web log is also about why we cannot wait. 
  “The Unfinished Dream” has excerpts from his Letter from a Birmingham Jail,

<p><strong>Blog #108. August 25, 2003: The NAACP: There they go again: Missing 
  Money, Audit refusal. </strong></p>
<p>At Saturday’s meeting of the NAACP, the new treasurer gave her report: $250,000 
  balance, including assets worth $164,000. $20,000 to send 11 people t the national 
  conference. So, as in the old “where’s the beef” commercial, I asked “where’s 
  the money?” I noted that in the May 31, 2003 previous treasurer’s report the 
  balance was $341,000. When I asked, people immediately started to leave the 
  room. So what’s missing? $86,000 that is claimed to have gotten lost in the 
  US Bank and Piper Jaffray merger. Say what? The merger didn’t go through. So 
  why are they blaming Piper Jaffray? Now add the $86,000 to the difference with 
  the May 31 report, $174,000, and that’s a cool quarter of a million unaccounted 
  for. A motion was made during the meeting to get an independent audit of the 
  books. It was blocked by the Chair, President Al Gallmon, who said the motion 
  was out of order. Say what? With Roberts Rules of Order our procedures, this 
  motion was perfectly in order. What, I ask for the zillioneth time, are they 
  trying to hide? Where is the money? Why do they refuse to get an audit? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #107. August 25, 2003: The NAACP: There they go again: Free Speech 
  for them, not for us.</strong></p>
<p>At Saturday’s meeting of the NAACP, Al Gallmon, Chair of the meeting and President 
  of the local branch was asked to explain his comments in the Star Tribune that 
  it would take generations to solve our problems (Martin Luther King, Jr., would 
  disagree with Al; see my “Solution Paper” “The Unfinished Dream” on this web 
  site). He refused to answer, stating he spoke as a pastor and as an ex-school 
  board member. Say what? As the NAACP local branch President, when he speaks 
  on NAACP matters, no matter what past or current role he has, he is still speaking 
  for the NAACP. He invoked his right of free speech. And yet when I exercised 
  my right, the NAACP slapped me with an “Article 10” and tried to shut me up, 
  ban me, and kick me out. In two weeks the National NAACP board member who oversees 
  the branches will be in town to hear the Article 10 charge of the local branch 
  against me. This is said to be the most important Article 10 hearing in 56 years. 
  I welcome the hearing. Let free speech and freedom ring for everyone, not just 
  NAACP officers. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #106. August 25, 2003: The 40th Anniversary of Martin Luther King, 
  Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech, August 28, 1963</strong></p>
<p>All this week we will honor Martin Luther King, Jr. and the 40th anniversary 
  of his “I have a dream” speech. To commemorate the mortal man and his immortal 
  speech, we have posted a paper, “The Unfinished Dream” on this our web site 
  under “Solution Papers.” After an introduction we let Dr. King speak for himself 
  with excerpts from his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” from his 1964 Playboy 
  Magazine interview, and his “I have a dream speech.” The paper concludes with 
  excerpts about Dr. King and others dreaming the dream from my book, “The Minneapolis

<p><strong>Blog #105. August 25, 2003: Complications in the “new” “Reality Show” 
  of “Voting Off the Island” called Hollman/Heritage Park: Real Experts</strong></p>
<p>Oops: a fourth cast (See blog entry #105 below): experts in biology and the 
  environment. Last Thursday at the meeting when the McCormack Baron people presented 
  the Braun Intertec report, the State’s lead environmentalist and confirmed the 
  danger of the arsenic and caught them in a lie. They had tried to say the contamination 
  was not petroleum based. The state expert said “oh no, it most certainly is.” 
  He said the arsenic is a problem that really (there is that “R” word again). 
  has to be addressed (see my column of July 2003 regarding more back up information 
  reporting on this).</p>

<p><strong>Blog #104. August 24, 2003: Minneapolis is home to a new “Reality Show” 
  that &#8220;Votes them off the Island&#8221; of Hollman/Heritage Park, out Olson Highway 
  way</strong></p>
<p>There are three casts. The first cast of reality players consists of those 
  who live there. The second cast of reality players consists of the institutions 
  responsible for this island called Hollman/Heritage Park from which the residents 
  can be &#8220;voted&#8221; off, and include McCormack Baron, Braun Intertec, the Mayor and 
  City Council, and City Agencies. The third cast consists of the voters who vote 
  in the Mayor and City Council who in turn hire the rest of the second cast. 
  But who gets voted off the island is much different from TV reality shows. It’s 
  not a group vote. The third cast votes once every four years for the second 
  cast. Then Mother Nature does the actual voting based on the actions of the 
  second cast or her use of gravity and/or underground pressure from peat bogs 
  that render homes unlivable. How Mother Nature votes is determined by the actions 
  of the second cast, with the City, McCormack Baron and Braun Intertec in the 
  starring roles. They help Mother Nature cast her votes faster and more frequent 
  by not cleaning up the toxins, by ignoring the lead and arsenic, by ignoring 
  the buried asbestos, by paving over areas where black gunk was seeping through, 
  as in sidewalks, and essentially denying there is a problem, leaving the treasure 
  hunt for poisons up to the first cast on which Mother Nature votes. So, with 
  lead and arsenic declared safe and asbestos ignored (actually: lied about), 
  Mother Nature will be voting first cast members “off the island” sooner that 
  we thought.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #103. August 23, 2003:Intimidation attempt on Community Activists 
  by McCormack Baron by using their testing company, Braun Intertec to do so</strong></p>
<p>What is in THERE water? How is it that Tuesday Deanna Lara, a manager of Braun 
  Intertec calls Mn State Representative Keith Ellison to tell him that my associates, 
  Zach Montoya and Flowers and myself, were coming onto the site Wednesday packing 
  with guns? Now the state may pass carry and conceal laws for the cities (and 
  I know my rural friends carry without concealing), but I don’t pack, and thus 
  have nothing to conceal. In checking, she confirmed making that statement. This 
  is more than intimidation. This is more than character assassination. In a post 
  9/11 world, weapons can also mean terrorism, treason, going against the government, 
  undermining homeland security. Maybe their drinking the Hollman/Heritage Park 
  water. Is she trying to set it up so we can be shot on the property because 
  of the rumor she plants that we pack? Hmmmmmm. At some point, I just hope that 
  some grownups show up at McCormack Baron and at Braun Intertec. It seems like 
  we are fighting for the children at Hollman/Heritage Park with the children 
  at McCormack Baron and Braun Intertec. Such intimidation doesn’t work as well 
  with people who have daily truth fests on their Blogs. Their attempt to paint 
  concerned citizens concerned about their poisoning or, perhaps more accurately, 
  concerned about their lack of concern and thus lack of action in dealing with 
  the toxins and poisons, as denizens of Dodge City waiting on main street at 
  High Noon so they can back shoot us rather than properly addressing their internal 
  problem. Sounds like a set up to me. What’s it sound like to you? Collusion? 
  Aiding and abetting?</p>

  victims of ID theft.” “May?” Nonetheless, the Strib also reports that he has 
  been place on paid leave, which clearly reflects there is not a lot of confidence 
  in this officer at the moment. Different stations had different levels of reflection. 
  A couple reported credit cards, IDs, social security numbers, as reported here 
  last week, in his locker. The Strib makes it sound like a locker not at Winter 
  park by calling it a “police locker.” Maybe they did in Eden Prairie. But make 
  no mistake, they are trying to lead us away from the reality that he had a locker 
  at Winter Park. Channel 5 had the best coverage, with Channel 11 less so, but 
  interviewing the Eden Prairie Chief of Police who talked of the importance of 
  reestablishing the trust of the community. But if he hasn’t done anything, what 
  trust is to be reestablished? Obviously they are holding back. We’ll find out. 
  Stay tuned. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #100. August 20, 2003: KSTP “scoops” all Minneapolis media, reports 
  the identity theft perpetrated against key Vikings players [Daunte Culpepper, 
  Randy Moss, and Michael Bennett]. But where is the Star Tribune and Clear Channel?</strong></p>
<p>On the six o’clock news tonight, KSTP, Channel 5, a NON-Clear Channel station, 
  broke the news of the identity theft at Winter Park of the Vikings, involving 
  a former security guard. KSTP said “The Vikings had no comment.” Hmmmm. Neither 
  confirm nor deny. Then its true. But we knew that as we “scooped” the Star Tribune, 
  Clear Channel radio and TV stations, etc., when we reported four days agothat 
  a Federal Task Force had descended on Winter Park, search warrants in hand, 
  and found evidence of identity theft by White perps or perpetrators. What KSTOP 
  report is ALL that is that the Minneapolis daily media organs have reported 
  in a week. More has appeared on this Web Log, starting four days ago (see # 
  93 and #94 below) than all the major media, print and broadcast, in the Twin 
  Cities. So what can we learn from story about crimes being committed against 
  three of the greatest players in Viking history, Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, 
  and Michael Bennett, by their White masters and the cover up of the White perpetrators? 
  Thinking people want to know.</p>
<p><strong>Five questions suggest themselves: </strong></p>
<p><strong>First: </strong>How is it that a lowly guy with a web log is able to 
  “scoop” the Star Tribune, the Clear Channel radio and TV stations, and the rest 
  of the daily media of Minneapolis media except the independent KSTP? Answer: 
  They have purposefully suppressed the story. There can be no other answers. 
  The Federal Task Force descended on Winter Park last week and found evidence 
  of the identity theft committed against Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, and Michael 
  Bennett. Every one knows. Not even the coaches are speaking up. Is this part 
  of the “conspiracy of silence” written about in the Spokesman-Recorder.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> What does this say about Red’s vaunted commitment 
  to his players when he lets them hang in the wind while he covers some White 
  boy close to him? How can he hold White staffers closer than his players? Answer: 
  It is obvious that his reputation and fortune are more important than the reputation 
  and fortunes of his players. It makes me think that his autobiography, called 
  “The Red Zone: Cars, Cows, and Coaches,” is what he is about: a man whose attitude 
  is simply this: players are cars to ride, cows to milk.</p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> Am I playing the race card by suggesting that if this 
  was Blacks it would be all over the papers? Of course. Think how little attention 
  was given, in comparison, to the White executive and players at last winter’s 
  blizzard event. The race card is real: not because I am manipulating emotions 
  but because that is how this Winter Park crowd has operated, especially over 
  the past 20 months, when it comes to how they have treated Black players and 
  how they got rid of most of the Black coaches. And who is Red protecting that 
  is close to him, and who is obviously a crook, that could turn that nice, honest 
  cop from Eden Prairie to do such dastardly deeds? Who corrupted him with the 
  offer of ripping off wealth players like Daunte, Randy, and Michael? When it 
  is White management folks, Red is not to be seen or heard nor are all of the 
  Strib reporters and radio talk shows hosts. Are they too in his back pocket? 
  They are part of the group to whom we will all say “Et tu brute” when they stab 
  us in the back along with Red when the team moves (see my question five below), 
  unless someone stops this pre-ordained plan (see my web log entry 31 below). 
</p>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> what does this say about giant corporations conflict 
  of interest owning media outlets? Answer: may nothing, maybe something. But 
  you can bet when Clear Channel stations discuss it the reason is because they 
  can’t suppress it any more and because they want to either put a good spin to 
  protect the boss (without having to be asked) or they have been told to put 
  on a good spin to protect the boss. So much for Clear Channel journalistic integrity, 
  openness, and honesty. With something kept quiet so obviously for a week, one 
  has to ask, what else are they suppressing and not reporting because such news 
  is not complimentary to them? And why is the Strib remaining quiet other than 
  they are in on the plan to boot the Viking out of town (their own reporter wrote 
  a book saying so). See my web log entry #32 regarding how the Star Tribune star 
  chamber kills news (see also #37). </p>
<p><strong>Fifth:</strong> how does this fit into my theory, in Chapter 15 of 
  my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” that the former owners sold 
  to an outside guy so he could either move the team or sell it to someone who 
  would move the team? Answer: it fits perfectly. Red’s silence condemns him. 
  He is obviously trying to keep a once shiny diamond that he has just kept tarnishing 
  for the past 20 months hoping the buyer he seeks won’t see all the flaws he 
  has caused by chipping away at it. Let’s face it Red, you’ve been tackled, 4th 
  and goal, at the one yard line. The only red zone left for you now is embarrassment.

<p><strong>Blog #98. August 19, 2003: Why can’t the NAACP find common ground with 
  the ideas of JFK and FDR or that admirer of FDR, Reagan? Why can’t the NAACP 
  and the DFL stop sounding like Herbert Hoover? </strong></p>
<p>Al Gallman, President of the local branch of the NAACP said essentially that 
  nothing can be done to f ix things for generations (see entry #89 below). Hmmmmm. 
  Why do he and he DFL sound like Herbert Hoover? Gallman said that it will take 
  generations. Hoover, riding with FDR on the way to FDR’s inauguration, said 
  “nothing can be done” about the depression. So even though Hoover brought help, 
  hope and restoration to Europe after World War I, he lost it regarding the United 
  States. So he provided leadership of no hope. And was not re-elected. George 
  H.W. Bush said he wasn’t into the vision thing. He too wasn’t re-elected. Yet 
  the federal government had developed programs while Hoover was President which 
  FDR then used. Why? Because FDR was a man of hope. He said “the only fear we 
  have is fear itself.” Bill Clinton said he was a man of hope form a place called 
  hope. Ronald Reagan said he was a man like FDR. Here is what Reagan said: ”We 
  are the showcase of the future. And it is within our power to mold that future-this 
  year and for decades to come. It can be as grand and as great as we make it. 
  No crisis is beyond the c capacity of our people to solve; no challenge is too 
  great.”</p>
<p>That is the message in my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.” I 
  outline a path, a process, if you will, in Chapter 17. Yet when the book was 
  sent to the City Council some sent it back. The NAACP and the Black Leadership 
  Forum have condemned the book. The NAACP, leadership forum, DFL and the City 
  Council prefer the status quo of them in power over their city plantation, whether 
  the hands be Blacks, GLBT, feminists, disabled, or other “challenged” or “victim” 
  groups that they persuaded to vote for them. I say we should quote JFK who quoted 
  George Bernard Shaw: “Ask not what your country can do for you but for what 
  you can do for your country.” There is no hope in the status quo except those 
  milking it for personal, political and economic gain. When they say things, 
  suggest things, do things, always ask this on question: “who benefits?” If it’s 
  them and not the people, beware. Their answers tell you whose side they are 
  real on.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #97. August 19, 2003: Education is key. Minnesota denies educational 
  achievement to Blacks, another form of identity theft</strong></p>
<p>The White education managers steals their students’ identify cards. White DFL 
  steals the future identify of young Blacks. The Star Tribune, 8-14-03 online, 
  carries the article “Minnesota’s achievement gap among the biggest in nation” 
  in terms of “passing rates of White students and Black students among states 
  that require high school exist exams.” This is the subject of chapter 7 of my 
  book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.” Nellie Stone Johnson said “No 
  education, no jobs, no housing.” Keeping Blacks under educated keeps them in 
  their place. There are only two answers as to why: either Blacks are too dumb 
  or the educational system is too racist to accord Blacks equality of teaching 
  and education. Science refutes the former leaving only the latter. Its time 
  to face that, Minneapolis, and act accordingly to ensure equal access and equal 
  opportunity of education for all, and that means reforming the educations system 
  from top to bottom, side to side.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #95. August 18, 2003: Are the DFL and Inner City African American 
  Men like Batman and the Joker, in the sense that both Batman and the Joker claimed 
  that the other had made them? </strong></p>
<p>Everyone who has seen the Tim Burton Batman movie knows the scene at the end 
  where the Joker tells Batman, who once had been unable to keep him from falling 
  into a vat of toxic wastes which froze his face into a smile, told the Batman 
  his evil was not his fault, that he, Batman, made him: “you made me.” Batman, 
  in finding out that it was the Joker who had killed his parents as a boy and 
  left him without parents, said to the Joker, “And you made me.” How many Blacks, 
  young and old, have been dropped in the toxic vat called Hollman/Heritage Park? 
  How has this affected their IQs and their subsequent social behavior? And how 
  many young Black men have been abandoned of hope by the policies of the DFL 
  and the NAACP? In this sense, many of those men caught up on the emergency regarding 
  young men (see Blog entry #90 below), and thus they, in many ways, can say to 
  the Whites, “you made us.” This analogy breaks down because there is nothing 
  that the Blacks have done to the Whites to cause them to be dropped into toxic 
  vats and even though the Whites have concentrated Blacks in poverty and crime 
  zones, there is no way that Whites can blame Blacks for locking them into non-toxic, 
  affluent suburbs, and say to them, “you made us” (unless, of course, you speak 
  of the taking of Black land and wealth, as discussed in Interlude 8 of my book, 
  “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,&#8221; those who took it &#8220;got made&#8221; financially).</p>

<p><strong>Blog #93. August 16, 2003: A Federal Task Force Investigating the NFL 
  Descended on Winter Park three days ago. Is it because it is about White boys 
  that the Strib doesn’t report the Search Warrants executed at Winter Park?</strong></p>
<p>The task force found evidence of significant credit card and name theft committed 
  by Whites close to the Viking administration and Whites of the internal security 
  detail. But NO players. Several questions and points become clear. First, is 
  it because this is about White boys that the Strib has kept it quiet three days? 
  Or is this just the usual Strib tradition: cover up for the Whites and tear 
  down the Blacks? The Feds wire tapped a number of NFL facilities. And the winner 
  this week was the Vikings. A locker full of identify theft evidence was found: 
  lists of player credit card numbers, lists of player Social Security numbers. 
  Red is trying to keep it suppressed to protect his friends. Which friends? Certainly 
  not his players. We have to include that he would rather protect his smarmy 
  friends than his players on his team, which should have been his first reaction. 
  It is said the silence is because they don’t want to distract the players from 
  winning. Say what? Are these babies? We know this is not true. If these men 
  can take NFL games they certainly can take NFL news. Before, if there were athletes 
  of color involved, the Strib provided coverage, and if it was a Black Head Coach 
  they provided a cold shoulder. How soon before ESPN and Sports Illustrated come 
  in, or does Red’s Clear Channel hidden hand extend that far as well? Why, with 
  its penchant for blanket coverage on personal peccadilloes, is not the Strib 
  covering this story, a story of one of the worst cases of fraud in the history 
  of the NFL? Why isn’t the Strib giving us a heads up? How often in the life 
  of the NFL do the federal task forces execute search warrants on the property 
  of an NFL team? Normally the Strib would be all over this and have Sports Illustrated 
  out to cover it, as it did with its hatchet job on Kirby Puckett, a Black guy. 
  This is only Red McCombs, a White guy, who is working with the Strib and the 
  rest to run the Vikings out of town. What they have done and are planning to 
  do to Minneapolis and Minnesota shows the Strib Star Chamber for what it is 
  (see my web log entries #31 and #32). Kirby and Randy seem like choir boys compared 
  to these thieves. But of course readers of my book (<i>The Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes,</i>especially my Chapter 15 on the Vikings), can understand 
  that I immediately begin to wonder how this will eventually be used to help 
  complete the local Planation folk’s plan to run the Vikings out of town? Rather 
  than stand up for our team (remember, no team members are involved), we’ll get 
  a “spin” on how this tarnishes the Vikes and thus makes it easier to run them 
  out. And when they do that they will have completed the ultimate in identity 
  theft for this community, taking the people’s team.</p>

  behavior that was. My congratulations again to the Strib. It continues its selective 
  harassment and lets its White readers know it is there for them to help keep

  cop was wrong but rather about how wrong the Strib is in the way it reported

  new toxin, arsenic, but said there was not enough for it to be a problem. OK., 
  so what are they saying, that we Blacks have greater immune powers? Would Whites 
  in Wayzata and Wood Hills and Eden Prairie be comfortable with that level of 
  arsenic in their water? Would the McCormack Barron people in St. Louis County 
  be happy with this level of arsenic in their’s? So, another white wash. And 
  there was nothing about asbestos in their support. When we confronted them about 
  asbestos, after their report was done, they had nothing to say and could not 
  address it (could not or would not?). A word of commendation: the meeting held 
  Thursday at the Urban League, a tense meeting indeed, was, well moderated by 
  Representative Ellison. Please note: when asked about the buried asbestos McCormack 
  Barron had two different stories, neither satisfying. I’ll have more for you 
  on this later as the information develops. Stay tuned.</p>

  respond if the state of emergency with inner city Black youth existed with White 
  youth? See new August 2003 &#8220;Solution Paper &#8220;State of Emergency for Black Youth.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Local NAACP President Al Gallman says our problems would take generations. 
  Really? Is that because that is how long he wants to collect from programs for 
  the livelihood of he and his friends? In this country, when there is a state 
  of emergency declared, all kinds of help is triggered. As I have pointed out 
  in my book, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, that Jawanza Kunjufu hit 
  the nail on the head with his book entitled State of Emergency: We MUST Save 
  African American Males. Under the “Solution Papers” section of this web site, 
  I have just listed 16 areas that he declares are states of emergency: “State 
  of Emergency For Black Youth.” I concur. And if these 16 parts of the state 
  of emergency for young Black males were true of Whites, they would declare a 
  state of emergency and fix it right away.</p>
<p>What does the Minneapolis branch of the NAACP do? Nothing. They don’t declare 
  an emergency. They don’t propose any solutions. They say its our fault, that 
  we’ve lost our sense of responsibility, and thus it will take generations to 
  fix (see web log entry #below 89). And now you know why I referred to them in 
  my book (Chapter 14) as the National Association for the Advancement of Cowed 
  People” or the “National Association for the Advancement of Corrupt Plantations,” 
  the latter being a reference to the DFL and the Democratic control of most cities 
  in this country.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #89. August 16, 2003: NAACP again puts down Blacks, asks us to 
  wait generations. With “friends” like that, who needs enemies?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s compare the comments of Condoliza Rice, a Republican, and President Bush’s 
  National Security Adviser, and Albert Gallman, pastor, local NAACP head, and 
  a Democrat. You know me: I’m a Nellie Stone Johnson Democrat. Look how close 
  to that Condi is and how far from that Al has gone.</p>
<p>Condi addressed the National Association of Black Journalists last week, and 
  addressed the universal struggle for freedom in America as well as elsewhere 
  in the world. She said (my emphasis with the bold):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We must never, ever indulge in the condescending voices who allege that some 
    people in Africa or in the Middle East are just not interested in freedom, 
    they&#8217;re culturally just not ready for freedom, or they just aren&#8217;t ready for 
    freedom&#8217;s responsibilities. We&#8217;ve heard that argument before, and we, more 
    than any, as a people should be ready to reject it. The view was wrong in 
    1963 in Birmingham, and it is wrong in 2003 in Baghdad and in the rest of 
    the Middle East. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, I might add, it is also wrong in 2003 Minneapolis. The 8-14-03 Star Tribune 
  on line (“Minnesota&#8217;s achievement gap among biggest in nation”) reports 
  that “The state has the largest gap between the passing rates of white students 
  and black students among states that require high school exit exams.” And how 
  does the NAACP react to this? Gallman gets it right when he says &#8220;The 
  sound way, the best way, to get up and out is to have a good education.” That 
  is the heart of Chapter 7 of my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes.” 
  But he gets it wrong twice when he says, first, “That piece is no longer the 
  bedrock for the African American community&#8230;we have gotten away from the 
  African-American community having a culture, an environment that says education 
  is important.” This is an indictment of the local branch of the NAACP, which 
  does nothing but foster the kind of negligence he outlines. He also gets it 
  wrong when he is reported as saying it “will take generations” to fix. He is 
  echoing the condescending view Condi decries: “not interested&#8230;not ready 
  for freedom’s responsibilities.” This is another example of how Black organizations 
  continue any action that keeps their jobs and thwart any that could make their 
  jobs unnecessary. This is why I ran for President of the NAACP local branch 
  and why the NAACP nullified those Black voters who voted for me and used White 
  voters to elect Gallman, to continue their White Minneapolis Plantation.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #88. August 16, 2003: Storming the root causes of our problems 
  following the path laid out in my book regarding education, jobs and housing</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked why I put down Don’s fasting and corner camping. I did not 
  put them down. My problem is not that they don’t address the problems, as they 
  do, but that they aren’t followed by proposals to address the real structural 
  issues behind them. And while he is out there it hasn’t stopped additional shootings, 
  some within a few blocks of his corner.</p>
<p>Fasting and camping on the corner are fine as far as they go. But we don’t 
  need another politician who feels our pain. We need politicians willing to take 
  action on the structural problems causing the difficulties in the inner city. 
  The only proposals I’ve seen so far have those in my book, which, when given 
  to the city council, half returned my book. This is the time to do something 
  specific for our community, as I outline fully in my book, “The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes.” Don needs to address what I raise regarding education, 
  housing and jobs. These are issues worthy to be stormed by all of us. As Nellie 
  Stone Johnson repeatedly said, and as I repeatedly repeat: “No education, no 
  jobs, no housing.” Now those are issues we should be storming. I do so in my 
  book. I will continue to do so. I invite Don and the rest of the council to 
  develop laws and regulations that will demonstrate education, jobs, and housings 
  for all as a priority. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #87. August 15, 2003: “Samuels Storm Troopers” should storm the 
  root causes of our problems, not storm our people</strong></p>
<p>I have again been asked how I could use the term “Samuels Storm Troopers” about 
  a brother (see #82 Below). Actually, I didn&#8217;t coin the term, I merely repeated 
  what I heard others say who didn&#8217;t want to be quoted. Surely no one watching 
  the activity in Africa could question the use. Being Black doesn’t always make 
  us right. That was our whole argument about Whites and Jim Crow. Being White 
  didn’t always make them right. This is a political issue, albeit with racial 
  overtones. Certainly the “irony” is not lost on us that our mediation with the 
  police is being undermined by calling in state troopers to harass Black citizens. 
  Justice and bringing in culprits? Yes, we are all for that. Shooters? Apprehend 
  them. No argument there. Gangbangers? Arrest them and don’t revolving door them 
  back to the street, of course. But intimidation, breaking bones and teeth, and 
  generally “having their way” with innocent young Black men whose only “offense” 
  is being Black and male? No.</p>
<p>We don’t need colonial mentalities or colonial tones or colonial methods. Putting 
  colored masters over other coloreds doing the bidding for higher White masters 
  is old school. We reject that and ask the bothe the Black and the White communities 
  not to get caught up in the brilliance of the public relations actions and get 
  confused and think that the rest of the Black community accepts and approves. 
  We don’t. I can’t speak for all but I know I reflect the view of many who are 
  indigenous descendents of slaves as opposed to immigrant Blacks. Don should 
  be working on the root cause of our problems: lousy education leading to lousy 
  opportunities combined with a lack of equal access and equal opportunity for 
  affordable housing, as well as lack of Black men in the lives of young Black 
  men. As Nellie Stone Johnson repeatedly said, “No education, no jobs, no housing.” 
  Now those are issues we should be storming. I do so in my book. I will continue 
  to do so on this web page.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #86. August 14, 2003:The October bombshell of 2001</strong></p>
<p>The meeting of October 19, 2001, as reported in my August 13 column, is nothing 
  less than a bombshell. The documentation I cite exposes the TOTAL misrepresentation 
  by the city and the shifting of money away from the places of obligations and 
  responsibilities they were intened for under, oops, 1996 assignment from the 
  federal government. The city hasn’t been able to produce one single report of 
  any of their samples or examinations or monitoring on that site. Not one document. 
  That is why the October 19, 2001 meeting was where everything started to unravel 
  in respect to the big lie, and where Ken Havey began to talk in terms of the 
  kind of money that was going to be spent and money allegedly in place already 
  for cleanup. So far, to date, the city has been unable (refuses?) to produce 
  any materials or documents as they pertain to monitoring. This meeting is extremely 
  damaging to them and underscores again the importance of the disappearance of 
  documents undertaken by Jackie Cherryhomes regarding which neither the Mayor 
  nor the White Council Members, nor the Star Tribune, raised an eyebrow or made 
  a complaint. The only ones to do so? Yours truly, Natalie Johnson-Lee, the Spokesman 
  Recorder and City Pages. We remain the “big four” watchmen and women of Minneapolis. 
  And we are looking for Whites as well as for Blacks. We will continue to do 
  so. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #85. August 13, 2003: “And what will the City do about the illegal 
  buried asbestos-wrapped pipes” in Hollman/Heritage Park?</strong></p>
<p>This is a the question I raise in today’s column about the asbestos wrapped 
  pipes dumped on the Hollman/Heritage Park site. The city claimed October 19, 
  2001 that this was cleaned up. Yet I have asked to see a copy of the work order 
  and the completion and toxicity reports. So if it wasn’t done were there fines 
  levied? Can the city prove its answer? No. The we have to ask: Is there a correlation 
  between the city not able to produce such documents and the files taken by Jackie? 
  We think so.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #84. August 13, 2003: Deja vu all over again in today’s column: 
  the trail of lies and broken promises continues</strong></p>
<p>In today’s column, serious questions are raised about the collusion of the 
  city and its developers to lie to the citizens/tax payers and to the federal 
  government, as the city continues to break its promise to the people of North 
  Minneapolis regarding Hollman/Heritage Park. In the middle of all of this is 
  Ken Havey and the City Council and their developer buddies and would be developer 
  buddies. As my book “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes” has documented, 
  this is a continuation of an old story (see especially Chapter 8). The record 
  is clear: public officials claiming one thing, appropriating money for cleanup 
  that doesn’t take place, and lying to the federal government about what it has 
  done. Why federal marshalls haven’t descended yet I dont’ know, but surely it 
  is only a matter of time. McCormack Barron has admitted it has made no surveys, 
  no tests regarding water and soil. So who is looking after the tax payers money 
  of Minneapolis? The city? No. The developers? No. The Black organizations? No. 
  Only the Black Focus group, including this web site, and this web log. So what 
  is going on? Think Enron. Think shredding. Think covering up. Think hiding. 
  They claimed to put in ground water monitoring equipment, although they couldn’t 
  quite get the figure right, as in 2000 they said $2.9 million and in 2001 Ken 
  Havey said it was $3.8 million. Now you know me, I’m a loyal citizen so I’ve 
  got to believe what my city officials tell me, isn’t that right? Not any more. 
  If they tell it to me then it has to be gospel, right? Not any more. Do you 
  believe them? And if you do, why?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #83. August 13, 2003: Choice: Modern America or Old Colonial? 
  The latter seems to be the choice being offered by RT Rybak and Don Samuels. 
  I choose Modern America. How about you? </strong></p>
<p>Some people have asked me why I took what they thought was a cheap shot at 
  Don Samuels yesterday in #82 below. My response: I didn’t take a cheap shot. 
  I like Don. I’m working with him. We work well together. But that doesn’t mean 
  that I accept all of his ideas or methods any more than he accepts all of mikne. 
  But in this case, we don’t agree. Facts are facts, and not liking the facts 
  doesn’t make them cheap. So let us face the facts. We understand Don’s call 
  to bring in the state police keep order. We agree with keeping order. We just 
  don’t agree with calling in the state troopers. The problem is that we are trying 
  to mediate with the police. This undermines mediation. Especially when the group 
  called in is lily White (only one Black state trooper, and he is from Duluth). 
  Calling in the police first is the colonial way. A persistent theme in my book, 
  “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” is that Minneapolis, for African Americans, 
  is run like a plantation, a colonial plantation. But the colonial way is not 
  our way. We live in a new America. We can achieve more by first mediating with 
  police about what is going on and how to resolve local crime issues rather than 
  call in the state police to beat us up.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0382b0812"></a>Blog #82. August 12, 2003: Calling in the State Police undermines police 
  – community mediation</strong></p>
<p>We appreciate how much City Council Member Don Samuels is trying to do to stand 
  up for the community and to draw attention to its problems. But we fail to see 
  the benefit to the community to call in special response teams of snipers into 
  the Black community. Why was the Highway Patrol called? Why not the City Police? 
  Answer: to intimidate Blacks. On the surface, White voters like this. But not 
  all in the community do. Worse, this also looks like another attempt to kill 
  the mediation process. The police Don called for are doing the same thing we 
  saw a decade ago: kicking the Black peoples’ backsides. Don has mastered great 
  public relations gestures that has the Whites cooing. The problem is that it 
  has Blacks running for cover. Why unleash the police on the community? We already 
  know they can kick us, shoot us, shove us around, harass us, intimidate us at 
  will. That is what the mediation is supposed to be about: to work to prevent 
  it from being done to innocent Blacks. Again: why call the state police? Is 
  it because they haven’t had an opportunity to kick our butts around for a decade 
  and its their turn again, that they want to join in on the fun? Isn’t this the 
  old same ‘ol same ‘ol: if you are Black and male you are a target, as the city 
  has demonstrated once again?</p>
<p>I have heard them referred to as the Samuels storm troopers, as what did they 
  do but break bones and teeth as they cut their swath through our community. 
  Although saying that is a bit much, I understand why it was said. This is not 
  supportive of mediation; it is intimidation. Are they trying to say to us that 
  the three young African Americans arrested for the wounding of the 18 month 
  old baby makes it OK? Why not the same state response for the 6 month old baby 
  who obtained lead poisoning at Hollman/Heritage Park? Because that baby was 
  done in by Whites, not Blacks. But they are not embarrassed to beat up on Blacks 
  in the ‘hood. Makes them look good. Nonetheless, we are still watching. Beating 
  us up and breaking our bones and teeth, especially those of young Blacks, just 
  because they are young and Black, does not pursue justice and fairness. But 
  in my book, my columns, and in this web log, I shall continue to pursue justice 
  and fairness. </p>

<p>An Urban Strategies employee living in Hollman offered to be a liaison for 
  the mother whose baby contracted lead poisoning, claiming that Urban Strategies 
  had nothing to do with McCormack Baron. Readers of my column, my web log, and 
  viewers of Black Focus know that Urban Strategies is the non-profit parent group 
  owned by McCormack Barron for its non-profit projects. He lives in her apartment. 
  When he thought he had gained her confidence, he confronted her and threatened 
  her, telling her not to listen to me and to “be careful.” What kind of people 
  are these McCormack Barron people? This employee was obviously not acting on 
  his own. We look forward to the time when McCormack Barron and its entities 
  view Holllman/Heritage Park as a community of people and not simply a revenue 
  source comprised of piles or bricks and mortars, two by fours and roofing.</p>

<p>If this wasn’t so egregious and cruel, it would be funny. McCormack Barron 
  has instituted a policy whereby rent is to be paid, by appointment, and if the 
  appointments are not schedule or kept, a fee of $25 is charged, even if the 
  office isn’t open regular hours to collect payments. Who ever heard of that? 
  I haven’t. Here is the Catch-22: they close the office early as well as claim 
  they are booked so they can’t take appointments, meaning the tenants get fined 
  $25 no matter how hard they try to pay. Is that sorry, or what? How’s that for 
  intimidation, threatening, and, oh yes, extortion? Why does the city allow itself 
  to be represented by folks like this? As the buck stops with the city, we can 
  only conclude that the city either wants tenants intimidated or just doesn’t 
  care.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #78. August 9, 2003: “Not Without Laughter:” Langston Hughes would 
  have approved of Blog humor, laughter and sarcasm </strong></p>
<p>Langston Hughes, one of our great Black writers, wrote his novel, “Not Without 
  Laughter” in 1930. He believed that lives should be lived with humor. Maya Angelou 
  reminds us that Langston Hughes understood that laughter was even more important 
  for those clinging “precariously on the rocky ledge of poverty and rejection.” 
  He knew that “people on discrimination’s rutted roads needed belly laughs to 
  get by.” Thus it is that he understood the need for grit and persistence in 
  a time of ignorance and racism. For him, “Laughter [is] employed to put disadvantage 
  into a manageable place [as it remains] a shelter which gives a needful people 
  succor and shelter in a time of storm.” So too with this Blog (web log). Some 
  people think I am being unnecessarily sarcastic. Well, I’m just trying to infuse 
  humor in some grim situations. We need to be serious. But we also need to laugh. 
  It has been said that the best bloggers “all have a contrarian outlook and irreverent 
  humor.” We are dealing with serious subjects, but no need to be sanctimonious 
  about it. Life must still go on in the day to day activities of the every day. 
  So if you find my statements fun, with humor, and are able to laugh with your 
  tears, then my occasional sarcasm and droll humor is helping make my points. 
  I’m satisfied if I’ve both informed you and entertained you and maybe even moved 
  you to commit to beginning a wider discussion of the solutions needed to resolve 
  the problems of Minneapolis, solutions that exist in every chapter of “The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes.” Have you read it yet? No? I’m shocked, shocked. Ok, 
  then, your turn: why not? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #77. August 9, 2003: Hollman/Heritage Park: the &#8220;joke&#8221; is on the 
  White tax payers and the increase of their property taxes</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, the tax payers are on the hook for Hollman/Heritage 
  Park. White tax payers. And now that people are not wanting to take units due 
  to the pollution, and as the clean up will cost even more money, creating more 
  delays costing yet more, the burden is on the taxpayer. You appreciate if we 
  Black folks smile, nay even laugh out loud, as the scam to benefit a few Whites 
  turns back upon the large number of Whites. We’ve watched this over and over. 
  It’s a high price to pay for keeping the Black people in their place. But what 
  does that say about the place a few Whites are keeping the majority of Whites? 
  Well, at least I see the humor here. So, the scam no one cared about because 
  only “the darkies” were getting screwed is now alarming Whites as they slowly 
  come to realize that the “laugh” is on them, as their taxes will not only have 
  to foot the bill, their taxes may well be raised in order for the city to be 
  able to pay for this and other problems of idts causing. Some say property taxes 
  could even double in the next five years. Langston Hughes would have appreciated 
  the humor and the irony. And now maybe White folks will be able to cultivate 
  a laugh as they travel on their tax paying rutted road.</p>

  harass, intimidate and beat us up. Now they are back. Must be their turn again. 
  A nearly all White state police force carrying guns and night sticks that excludes 
  minorities from its force is a new form of an old concept: White supremacy, 
  which we saw as literal as they came through our neighborhoods last week, breaking 
  bones and teeth and harassing young Black men. We raised the integration question 
  in 1993. We raise it again. Probably nothing more signifies the state’s lack 
  of desire to integrate the state police that the fact that they remain lily 
  White regardless of whether the Governor is DFL, Independent, or Republican. 
  What an example for our young people. &#8220;Law and order&#8221; is used to detract from 
  real solutions, such as those in my book, and &#8220;law and order&#8221; is used to detract 
  from the fact that the state continues to purposefully keep its White state 
  police segregated: Blacks need not apply. Again: what an example of hope for

  up the confusion regarding what is going on environmentally at Hollman/Heritage 
  Park. But Braun Intertec won’t get back to them. These nice clear air, clean

  honest and up front. Why? Because they are White? Yeah, right. As the Black 
  man might say, "welcome to our world." My, my. None have, as yet, released the 
  results of the tests. But we know from my July 30 column that their claims re 
  why they can’t are not truthful. Maybe clean air and clean water and clean soil 
  is only for DFLers. Hmmmm. I wonder what color the DFL is. The DFL has stuck 
  it to Blacks; they are trying to stick it to Greens (many of whom are White). 
  So the colors that come to mind for the DFL are yellow and lavender. But certainly 
  not Green or Black. So tell me, dear readers, what color do you think the DFL 
  is? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MPHA ensures compliance with Section A requirements regarding lead based paint 
    and other hazardous materials through its provisions of educational materials 
    provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency together with disclosure 
    of information forms completed by the MPHA program participant lessees and their 
    landlord lessons. In completing the disclosures, both leassors and leasees acknowledge 
    knowing LBP and other hazardous materials at the property. If the leasee certifies 
    that a problem has been tested and it is determined that the child has excessive 
    levels of lead, the landlord is required to remove or abate chipped paint or 
    other hazardous conditions and to certify in compliance with HUD regulations 
    prior to leasees moving in and annually thereafter MPHA conducts housing quality 
    standard HQS inspections. Every section 8 participant completes lead questionnaires

<p><strong>Blog #69. City Council Members return book. In others words, citizens solutions 
need not apply.</strong></p>
<p>After reading my columns, web log entries, and watching my weekly TV show, 
  people express sympathy for the situation of Minneapolis, are shocked by what 
  they have read, and ask what can be done, what can the city do, what can they 
  can do. I remind them that a good process and list of places to start is outlined 
  in my book, "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes," in Chapters 5 and 17. 
  They address a process and tools for resolving our problems. Therefore, to help 
  do my part, I requested of my publisher to send a copy of my book to each City 
  Council Member and a second one to the Mayor (he was given a copy last November). 
  Several sent the book back saying they could not accept gifts. And yet it was 
  not sent as a gift, as you can see from the letter sent to them with the book 
  (see the July letter to them in the "Occasional Papers" section of this web 
  site). It was sent so that the city could "benefit from the insights and suggested 
  proposals." The letter goes on to say that "He proposes solutions you can use 
  to resolve the difficulties, which, again, could be used in any city and would 
  make a great platform for change if used by the Minneapolis City Council." The 
  letter also summarizes the book&#8217;s list of issues to be addressed and notes that 
  "Ron summarizes all of his recommendations in Chapter 17" with details throughout, 
  especially Chapter 5. So what do we learn from this: that for the Minneapolis 
  City Council: citizen recommendations and suggestions need not apply. And then 
  they want to know why I refer to them with the phrase <i>Violation of a Trust, 
  Betrayal of a People.</i></p>
<p>The City Council wants to be our watchdogs but they don&#8217;t want any watchdogs 
  looking over them. Sorry. That reciprocity is what democracy and freedom and 
  liberty and their oath of office is all about. Our job as citizens is to be 
  the watchmen and women. Therefore, I will begin to suggest specific solutions 
  to answer the "what needs to be done" question that they refuse to address. 
  I invite others to do the same. Let&#8217;s all do so. Our suggestions count too. 
  Our suggestions apply. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>All the thieves in the story "Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves" had to say "Open 
  Sesame" to get the cave door to the treasure to open. In Minneapolis, all they 
  have to utter is "affordable housing" and other happy talk "Open Sesame" phrases. 
  The government, unlike a bank that would only loan you 90% to develop an apartment 
  building, will issue bonds for you at 120% or 130%, so all the Ali Babas of 
  the city can add their different fees and the "costs" for their special purpose 
  entities that absorb the "profits" of the developer and the budgets of the agencies, 
  so there are no taxes to pay. So the taxpayer pays twice. This is why there 
  are few if any privately funded and owned apartment buildings. The developers 
  have been funded by the taxpayer (with ownership going to the private developer). 
  Thieves indeed, milking the cash cows of collected taxes and issued bonds, as 
  do their part in the <i>Violation of a Trust, Betrayal of a People,</i> increasing 
  the city&#8217;s debt and decreasing its ability to keep the city clean and safe and 
  our kids educated.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0367b0805"></a>Blog #67. Mobilizing Citizen People Power through Knowledge/information and Communications: 
  Avoiding the Spin and Disinformation of the Strib and the Major Media Outlets.</strong></p>
<p>What is our most important weapon? Knowledge/Information. What is the ammunition 
  we fire with that weapon: Communications. If knowledge/information is power, 
  getting the information out, communications, is how to turn that power to victory 
  for the people.</p>
<p>Neither the city nor the developers nor the political parties are coated with 
  Teflon. We will make our charges stick. We will make our power realized. We 
  will turn them back into agents of the people. We will make our demand for equal 
  access and equal opportunity for all stick. The communication vehicle I chose 
  was my book. But when the mainstream press would not acknowledge it (see #32 
  below), I started this web page and when they still wouldn’t (see #37 below), 
  I engaged this daily web log. Where will you get accurate knowledge/information 
  on a daily basis in Minneapolis? From the Strib? You’re kidding. From the local 
  TV and radio stations? Really? Are they covering what I cover? The mainstream 
  media doesn&#8217;t cover, they cover up. They censor. They spin. They distort. They 
  disinform.</p>
<p>To avoid censorship, spin, and disinformation, read these daily web logs. When 
  you read here and then read/listen to them, you will agree with many others 
  that have told me that they find this web site, column, and daily web log one 
  of the few truly independent voices today in Minneapolis. I lay it on the line. 
  I tell it like it is. I’m not here to work for the Plantation Masters nor their 
  hired hands, nor for the left wing nor the right wing. I’m here to work for 
  the people. It is what I have done for 40 years. It is what I will keep doing. 
  Read about my work in detail in my book "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes," 
  and read my weekly column and daily web log for the continuation of that 
  story. Democracies need watchdogs, not monopolistic bureaucracies or ideological 
  political parties. May we all take back the power of citizenship and be good 
  watchdogs so our governments and their agencies will serve the people, not themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #66. Holman/Heritage Park is only a small portion of a much greater environmental 
minefield: North Minneapolis West of the Mississippi</strong></p>
<p>The July 31-August 6, 2003 issue of the <i>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</i> 
  newspaper has a headline that shows why this is BOTH a Black and White issue, 
  in its cover story: "Industrial Contamination surrounds Hollman/Heritage Park 
  Site," with the sub-head "Concerns about the development’s environment extend 
  far beyond the water in a pond." Besides the sites identified on the property, 
  many more sites in greater concentration are in the areas between Hollman and 
  the Mississippi. Let’s make sure that when the city and state get serious about 
  cleanup, Hollman/Heritage Park gets equal attention and equal clean up. After 
  Love Canal 25 years ago, ignorance is no longer an option. The original polluters 
  may be long gone but their legacy remains. How we deal with it today will determine 
  the legacy we leave for our children when they look back 25 years from now on 
  how we dealt with this. As a community, private and public, we can deal with 
  and solve it together. If we engage in blaming and scape goating and triaging 
  certain groups or areas, we won’t solve it. But if we work together, it can 
  and will be solved. Which way, Minneapolis, which way?</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Blog #65. Is Minneapolis following the Love Canal Model? What happens when you can’t 
  trust your government?</strong></p>
<p>The current issue of <i>Newsweek</i> magazine, August 4, 2003, has this story, 
  pp. 50-51, "Love Canal’s Long Shadow: Twenty-five years later, another New York 
  town turns toxic." Love Canal is in a Niagra Falls, NY neighborhood, and has 
  long been the "poster-child" for the lack of attention to environmental contamination 
  reality. For those who don’t remember, this is what Newsweek reminds of about 
  Love Canal:</p>
<ul>
  Homes and schools had been built around land that had once served as a dumping 
  ground for a toxic brew of industrial-waste chemicals. Frantic over a rash of 
  heatlh problems, many residents wanted to leave, but couldn’t sell their tainted 
  homes. Led by housewife Lois Gibbs, they pressured state and federal officials 
  with a barrage of protests, media coverage and lawsuits. Eventually, the effort 
  forced President Jimmy Carter to declare a health emergency, evacuate families 
  and offer cash for their homes. Love Canal proved that ordinary citizens could 
  take on the system ­ and win. 
</ul>
<p>The major difference with Minneapolis is that McCormack Barron and its Basset 
  Creek companies and its Urban Strategies group knew about the toxic underlay, 
  and made the bet that it would stay put. They bet with peoples lives and taxpayers 
  money. They must have also bet that if their hand got "called," the taxpayers 
  would bankroll their bad bet. The <i>Newsweek</i> magazine article says "taxpayers 
  not polluters, are now shouldering most of the costs," either directly or through 
  "the Superfund program." Does Hollman/Heritage Park change the equation of EPA’s 
  certitude "that there aren’t any more Love Canals out there," which is why, 
  the article says, "it’s much more difficult to convince the American people 
  that a problem exists"? And proof is hard. Direct probability linkage is often 
  difficult (the case was never made at Love Canal) but there is a statistical 
  category called "statistical correlation" and "correlation coefficients" (I’m 
  not a statistician; you now know all I know, but the city and state and federal 
  planners are supposed to be able to use these techniques and the data they generate 
  correctly on our behalf).</p>
<p>And don’t you just love it when officials say there is "no immediate health 
  risk," which ignores longer term exposure? Try telling there is now "milder 
  contamination" than Love Canal to those already suffering physical symptoms, 
  the babies with the lead poisoning, and the grass and flowers that won’t grow. 
  Finally, what about the animals and birds that avoid Hollman/Heritage Park? 
  What are they telling us that we should be listening to? Near the end of the 
  <i>Newsweek</i> magazine article is this statement of an affected resident of 
  Love Canal: "I don’t trust my government." The article then ends with this sentence: 
  "And that could be the most lasting Love Canal legacy of all." We have a great 
  city in Minneapolis. Tough times require great leadership to stand up for all 
  the people, such as we have seen in Council Members Don Samuels and Natalie 
  Johnson-Lee and State Representative Keith Ellison. Will the Mayor? Will the 
  other Council members? Will their agency bureaucrats? Will the Governor and 
  the state legislators? Will the <i>Star Tribune</i> provide journalism or jingoism; 
  will it put special interests first or citizens first? Which way, Minneapolis, 
  which way?</p

<p><strong>Blog #64. Sleight of hand shell game on Hollman/Heritage Park water testing continues.</strong></p>
<p>Isn’t it wonderful that McCormack Barron can take samples and report that there 
  is no problem with the water? And isn’t wonderful that the Star Tribune reports 
  their report? And isn&#8217;t wonderful that the city says they either don&#8217;t have 
  the report or only McCormack Barron can release it? How wonderful for them. 
  But not for us. It is not wonderful that they try to fool us. Why do they treat 
  the truth as a three card monte game? That report was from the tap water, not 
  the two children’s playgrounds, as best we can tell. And if they took any samples 
  from that portion of the sidewalks as shown on my TV show and which will be 
  continued to be shown, where the bubbly, black, gooish liquid, very foul smelling 
  stuff, was seeping up through the sidewalk, they haven&#8217;t admitted it. But they 
  did cement over it to prevent others from taking samples (but not before I got 
  mine). Do they have samples from this area, four and a half feet from the children’s 
  playground, near 700 Bryant Avenue North? If not, why not? That toxic ooze left 
  reddish stains the entire length of the driveway (about 30 feet). They then 
  whitewashed the stain, scrubbed it (but couldn’t get it all out). And they cemented 
  over the corrosion of the sidewalk there and again twenty feet away, where the 
  metal grid was needed due to the extent of corrosion in that area. All of this 
  is in the video we show on our TV show on Sundays at 5 pm, on Channel 17, MNT-TV. 
  But that isn’t the real problem. The real problem is that they plugged that 
  portion where the goo, etc., was seeping through by cementing over it. If that 
  is not a cover up then it is up to them to proove it isn&#8217;t. And so far they 
  are remaining silent. We have the video. We have the sample of what oozed through, 
  as reported in my July 30 column. All of this raises the simple question: how 
  close to a criminal investigation have we gotten? It certainly seems to me everything 
  is in place to shout out the need for one to investigate their <i>Violation 
  of a Trust and Betrayal of a People.</i></p>

<p><strong>Blog #63. More about the Hollman/Heritage Park NOT Being "Private" Piggy Bank.</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked for more detail on Blog entry #48 on Monday, about the City 
  of Minneapolis saying that as Hollman/Heritage Park is a private development, 
  only the developer, McCormack Barron, can take samples and only McCormack Barron 
  can release the results of the samples. Who said that? Ken Havey, the city’s 
  person in charge of the project. The Federal government has established clear 
  precedent that in cases where it is established that there are health problems, 
  the developer no longer has the right to control the information. This is a 
  shell game on the city’s part. They just don’t want to have to report their 
  incompetence (best case) or malfeasance (worst case). KSTP-TV did an excellent 
  job reporting on this Friday night. And KSTP has taken samples. The city is 
  purposely ignoring established case law. It is case law that makes up the background 
  to the Clinton Administration’s Executive order that I cite in my column Wednesday 
  and which refutes what both Havey and McCormack Barron are saying. I will be 
  reporting more about it. Stay tuned for more regarding the stereo (City and 
  Developer) <i>Violation of a Trust, Betrayal of a People.</i></p>

<p><strong>Blog #62. Mobilizing Citizen People Power Over Bureaucratic/Politician Power: A 
  Watchdog for Minneapolis to Fight the Violation of Trust and the Betrayal of 
  the People, so that No Child, No Adult, is Left Behind.</strong></p>
<p>People ask me why I keep this daily web log. Good question. Remember the two 
  phrases from the 60s and 70s, "Black Power" (which was too narrow as it was 
  incorrectly perceived as for Blacks only) and "Power to the People" (which was 
  so broad it was incorrectly perceived as just a slogan). Let’s unite them and 
  take them a step further: People Power. In other words, action. That is what 
  this web site is about. We, the citizens, can fight back. What do we fight for? 
  Equal access and equal opportunity in education so we can all qualify for good 
  jobs and earn a good living so we can afford good homes. But we have to fight 
  for it. When the French undermined our national security we stopped buying French 
  products: people power. When Gray Davis lied about the size of the deficit and 
  inspired a recall: people power. That is the power of the people. We don’t like 
  to be lied to. And right now, the biggest liars are the mainstream media who 
  cover up for their cronies (be they in government, corporations, political parties, 
  unions, education, development, etc.). Both political parties are buying votes. 
  Bureaucrats seek wage increases and job security even as those their agencies 
  were founded to serve are served less or not at all. We must return elective 
  officials and their bureaucratic staffs to true public service, not self service, 
  so they make sure every child has a chance to become a contributing adult in 
  society. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #61. A good Education is still the key to good jobs, good housing, and avoiding 
jail.</strong></p>
<p>Last Tuesday, <i>One Nation News</i> reported what the new president of the 
  National Urban League said last Sunday that although the number of African Americans 
  with bachelor&#8217;s degrees is at an all-time high, it is a success story with a 
  dark side: the rate of Blacks admitted to college is still less than the rate 
  of incarceration of black men. He noted that, according to data for the year 
  2000, there are states in this country where "there are more African Americans 
  in prisons than in college."</p>

<p><strong>Blog #60. How can a Democrat seem to be writing against Democrats and especially 
  against the DFL?</strong></p>
<p>This is a question I get a lot. I don&#8217;t write against democrats. Remember, 
  I am not an ideologue. I write against any and all policies, Democratic or Republican, 
  that don&#8217;t support equal access and equal opportunity for all, Black and White, 
  in education, jobs, and housing. So if the shoe fits, wear it. And if it is 
  too tight and uncomfortable, that should be a sign of the need for change. I 
  am a Nellie Stone Johnson democrat (read about her in my book in Interlude 3). 
  Nellie started the Farm Labor party for the people. When Hubert Humphrey came 
  a courting, he acceded to her will that the merger of her DL party (2nd largest 
  in the state) and HHH’s Democratic Party (3rd in the state) keep all three names. 
  The DFL has strayed from and betrayed Nellie’s concentration on justice for 
  all the people. Thus, as I look at the DFL and Minneapolis as a whole, what 
  I see, through my eyes, is a <i>violation of a trust and a betrayal of a people. 
  Let us be frank: I wish the Democrats would do as much for the people of Minneapolis 
  as the Republicans do for the suburbs, which they would if they saw Blacks as 
  equal.</i> And I am a Martin Luther King, Jr. Democrat (see Interludes 4 and 
  15 in my book). I follow his dream of working non-violently for jobs and freedom 
  for all. As seemingly no one else will speak up about how the DFL has betrayed 
  us, I will. I do not live in nor think in an intellectual box where every one 
  and every idea in my box is right and those outside it are wrong. We live in 
  a modern age. The chief characteristic of our time is that we have the ability 
  to grasp the need for evidence, find the evidence, and evaluate the evidence. 
  Those who demonize President Bush are no better than those who demonized President 
  Clinton. Those who demonize the Republican Party are no better than those who 
  demonized the Democrats. Why must each become what they hate? Demonization leads 
  away from the common good. We are all fellow citizens living in the same world 
  and sharing what used to be called "the commons." My goal is to work for the 
  common good of all our people. And what is the common good? In my eyes, we need 
  to fight for the common YESes (things I believe we need for the common good) 
  and fight the common NOs (things I believe that go against the common good). 
  This is what I stand for (these YESes and NOs are listed in my book in Chapters 
  5 and 17). Beyond that, I share Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream of jobs and 
  freedom for all. Look for my upcoming papers on affirmative action and on the 
  40th anniversary of MLK, soon to appear in the "Occasional Papers" section of 
  this web site. It should be clear by now that I don’t blindly follow the Democrats 
  or the NAACP or any other group. I follow the Declaration of Independence and 
  the Constitution. I am saddened that the DFL has deviated from democratic principles. 
  I stand with John F. Kennedy as a watchman for justice. In the speech he had 
  intended to deliver in Dallas in November of 1963, he was going to say We in 
  this country ... the watchmen on the walls of world freedom." I invite you to 
  stand on that wall with me. For more on what I stand for, see Chapter 5 of my 
  book, "Justice and Fairness."</p>
