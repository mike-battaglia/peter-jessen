<p><strong>Blog #162. September 30, 2003: Is learning personal or collectivist, 
  and measured in student performance or school budget?</strong></p>
<p>It has been the contention of “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” that 
  our Minneapolis story is also the story of inner cities across this country. 
  In my Chapter 7, on education, kids are referred to as being like baby seals 
  being clubbed into inferiority and helplessness. Instead we need to teach skills, 
  optimism, and hope. And I’ve laid out some suggestions for how to do so in Chapter 
  17 of my book and in the Seven Solutions Solution Paper on this web site. 
  Society offers a minimum wage. In Chapter 7 of my book I write about society 
  offering only a minimum education. Indeed, courts in New York City ruled they 
  were obligated “only to provide a minimally adequate opportunity,” an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; 
  that was defined as an eighth grade education. This attitude is in Minneapolis 
  also, as only 17% of Black males graduate from Minneapolis high schools (p. 
  120 of my book). What we are finding out is that our city only offers inner 
  city kids a minimum education. “Beat the odds” schools (see p. 122 of my book) 
  means they are bad to begin with and that success comes not as a byproduct of 
  the system but despite it, that they have beaten the odds of not getting a good 
  education. Here’s the kicker: regarding fourth grade literacy in America, as 
  noted in my Chapter 7: 63% of African American fourth graders are illiterate, 
  58% of Hispanic. </p>
<p>It was announced last week that Bill Gates is giving New York City $51 million 
  to help create smaller high schools. BUT: New York City spent more that $12 
  billion on its public schools last year, up from $10.6 billion in 2000 and $8 
  billion in 1997, a 50% increase. AND: the teaching staff today of 90,000 does 
  what 35,000 did far better 50 years ago for roughly the same number of students. 
  YET: half of this year’s freshman class in New York City is not expected to 
  graduate in four years (a number that is unchanged in a decade). So it is not 
  surprising that 40% of the city’s schools, including most of the middle schools, 
  don’t meet federal standards. And in Washington D.C., the nation’s capital? 
  It spends $12,046 per student, highest in the nation, yet only 10% of D.C. fourth 
  graders and 9% of D.C. eighth graders read at grade level, and only 10% of D.C. 
  eighth graders can write at grade level and only 6% of D.C. 4th and 8th graders 
  can perform math at grade level. The U.S. Senate is saying no to a voucher program 
  offering $7,500 vouchers to let parents have choice to send their kids to private 
  or parochial schools (see Blog #113 below) that the Senators have for themselves 
  but deny to the citizens. </p>
<p>It took the Russians decades to realize that collectivized farming was a terrible 
  idea: Lenin said he would rather everyone in Russia die of hunger than allow 
  free trade in grain. How many of our kids have to be clubbed before we recognize 
  that collectivized education is just as bad and that we need free trade in education 
  too? Or, for Blacks, to &#8220;keep them in their place,&#8221; is this what is desired 
  (the racism bit)? Side note: no U.S. Senator sends his or her kids to the D.C. 
  public schools. Having said that, why, then do U.S. Senators want to keep poor 
  kids trapped in bad schools? Seattle: some years ago, Seattle hired a non-educator, 
  a retired general, to clean up its failing school system. He had no academic 
  credentials. He succeeded. Minneapolis: if, as it has been said, that war is 
  too important to be left to the military, perhaps education is too important 
  to be left to educators. As I write in my book, p. 119: “As a school system 
  goes, so goes a city.” The examples here show that no one, especially educators, 
  have a monopoly on a solution although education as currently constituted continues 
  to short change minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics, with the latest 
  excuse being its the parents of the kids fault. Thus I write, on p. 119: “The 
  reality is that only education on one end and jobs on the other end can save 
  the city, something which is not accepted nor appreciated by either the City 
  or the schools’ controlling body, the teacher unions, based on how they have 
  allowed education to go downhill for minorities in the inner city, just as they 
  have allowed it to go uphill in terms of pay, benefits, and retirement in the 
  suburbs.” </p>
<p>As I wrote on p. 119 (which is still true, which is why the book is as relevant 
  today as it was the day it was published): “The struggle for schools to succeed 
  is not about who is in charge but about loosing poverty’s grip on the wards 
  where the schools are.” </p>
<p>The polar bears of the suburbs get theirs. The baby seals of the city get clubbed. 
  We need our school system to be led by leaders who will declare equality of 
  access and opportunity for all, not just for suburban Whites. Our kids are being 
  clubbed by those who are supposed to teach them. Why should those who gave us 
  this apartheid system (see pp. 122-123 of my book) be allowed to be in charge? 
  Our schools are not the product of bad parents. They are the product of bad 
  DFL education policies. Even more disgraceful is that the NAACP supports the 
  status quo. As I conclude my education chapter, p. 126: “will we continue to 
  lead the nation in showing how to club our Black kids or will we lead the nation 
  to demonstrate how to give them as good an education as the suburban schools?” 
</p>
<p>Learning is personal, not collectivist. And history has shown us that money 
  spent on adult educators and bureaucrats will not make kids learn. So who heads 
  up education is not as important as what they will be taught and how it will 
  be taught. The school leader should be someone who will pledge to (1) work for 
  the Common YESes and against the common NOs as listed on pp. 100-102 and 302-303 
  of my book, and pledge to (2) give a fair hearing to and discussion of the education 
  solutions section of my Seven Solution areas listed in the Solution Papers 
  section of this web site. But before the Superintendent can do that, the Board 
  must make that commitment first. Wouldn’t you agree? And if not, why not?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #161. September 29, 2003: NAACP: Rescuing the Seals or Joining 
  in the Clubbing of the Seals? </strong></p>
<p>The PPS Superintendent controversy continues to stir the passions over. As 
  I wrote yesterday, that’s not really the issue. The issue, as I discuss in my 
  book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” Chapter 7, is education in the 
  Minneapolis Public Schools in terms of how well the kids are educated, in terms 
  of how many are “at grade level.” Whether White or Black, male or female, liberal 
  or conservative, DFL or Republican, it hasn’t mattered much who has been Superintendent, 
  as the results in terms of the kids have been the same: The school system, for 
  Blacks in the inner city, has been corrupt and racist, as reflected in my chapter 
  subtitles: “Poor Schools for Poor Kids to Keep them Poor: Clubbing the Cubs 
  into Inferiority and Helplessness.” And thus I pleaded “Stop the Clubbing and 
  Teach Skills, Optimism, and Hope.” Now we have a leadership change again. But 
  what is being debated? Education? No. Performance of kids? No. Reducing the 
  illiteracy of our kids, where, in America, 63% of Black fourth graders and 58% 
  of Hispanic 4th graders are illiterate? No, not at all. Debated is political 
  party, education certification, and color. How can they say any given candidate 
  is or is not qualified when the evidence suggests that, from the standpoint 
  of outcomes, none have been qualified (White or Black, male or female, DFL or 
  Republican) if we judge by outcomes? The issue is not who gets the baton of 
  the education orchestra, but what music is going to be played. Before we debate 
  the who we need to debate the what and the how. But I don’t reprimand without 
  suggesting a solution. I offer solutions in my book (Chapters 7 and 17) and 
  have expanded on those in my “7 Solutions” piece posted on my web site’s Solution Papers section. Without a discussion of outcomes, the current debate won’t make 
  a difference. Let’s not put the cart before the horse. When the national NAACP 
  held its hearing earlier this month to find out why the local NAACP under Rev. 
  Gallmon kicked me out and banned me from the NAACP, the local branch said much 
  of it was because of what I wrote in my book. When asked what I wrote Rev. Gallmon 
  couldn’t answer and had to take a ten minute recess to have aides provide him 
  with passages, which, when he read them, the audience responded positively, 
  in agreement with what I wrote. And many of the Black leadership of this town 
  told its members a year ago not to buy or read my book. This is not leadership. 
  This is a plantation mentality (some what a Plantation run by Whites, other 
  by Blacks; take your pick; the process is the same). We need to have an open 
  and honest discussion of the issues. We need to get away from the who and ask 
  what and how. We need to stop fearing open dialogue. How can we ask to be listened 
  when we won’t listen to each other? Is it any wonder we don’t make a difference? 
  Until such time as we are willing to listen to each other, starting with the 
  suggestions I’ve laid out, why will “the powers” feel they have to listen to 
  us? Clearly it won’t make a difference who is Superintendent, as far as Black 
  kids in the inner city are concerned, as the clubbing will continue as long 
  as the Black community doesn’t stand up to the clubbing. Again, lets discuss 
  the issues in my Chapter 7 and in my 7 Solutions paper, for if its going to 
  be the same ‘ol same ‘ol, we are wasting our time. It has been said that war 
  is too important to be left to the military. Maybe education is too important 
  to be left to the educators. Certainly my book outlines in chapter after chapter 
  that the city is too important to have been left to a single party and it’s 
  elected, appointed, and hired officials.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #160. September 28, 2003: Hollman: Clean Bill of Health or Health 
  Cleaning Bill?</strong></p>
<p>On Thursday, September 25, 2003, The Minneapolis City Council passed a bill 
  authorizing $1.2 million to Bassett Creek Valley, which is the creek behind 
  OIC and across the street from Hollman/Heritage Park and the site of the next 
  phase of Hollman/Heritage park. How, given the clean bill of health a month 
  ago does it now require a clean-up bill of $1.2 million? Or is this intended 
  for the area of the new Ball Park Village that is to run along Bassett Ceek 
  just west of the Target Center and their planned 2,000 new homes and neighborhood 
  shops there?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #159. September 28, 2003: Local control of education or just control 
  of the locals?</strong></p>
<p>Leaders of the African American Community held a press conference Friday to 
  denounce the appointment of David Jennings as the new Minneapolis School Superintendent. 
  Once again the focus settles on the concept of “respect” for the adults involved 
  when in fact the focus should be the respect shown to students. To rally against 
  this decision on the grounds of the lack of community input and involvement 
  in the decision misses the mark (especially when the previous Superintendent, 
  a Black woman, was also hired without a national search and without public input). 
  There are really only three issues. All the rest is political posturing. The 
  issues are local control, educational outcomes, and the process for dealing 
  with the performance or lack thereof. Before we can know who the right person 
  is we have to have the right process. This process clearly reflects the title 
  of Chapter 7 of my book: “The Corrupt and Racist Education System.” The announcement 
  of a search that is cancelled by an announcement done without notice shows not 
  only the corrupt nature of the process but a disrespect for the Black community 
  (not the so-called leadership, whatever that is, but the community). Perception 
  is sometimes more damaging that reality. Whether one agrees or disagrees with 
  the state requirement of certain academic credentials for the position, that 
  is still not the issue: the system is. Having said that, the system, which created 
  rules, owes the community an answer to its questions when it decides not change 
  the rules. In other words, when did the state receive and authorize the waiver 
  regarding having academic credentials? Who made the application? Who granted 
  it? And why?</p>
<p>And we have the Open Meetings Law. The tradition in America is to have schools 
  responsive to local control. Over the past four decades this has become little 
  more than a charade as the control has been usurped by the state and federal 
  governments. To have 70% of the students be of color and yet not involve the 
  communities of color is an affront that goes beyond the notion of pettyness 
  on our part as Blacks. It goes to the heart of the plantation system of education 
  (and the “irony” is not lost on me that these same groups have often gone along 
  with supporting bad education policy as long as there was something in it for 
  them or as long as there was a Black in charge. My interest is not the adults 
  involved but the kids). It reminds me of Senator George McGovern’s asking the 
  Black leaders at the 1972 national Democratic Party convention to gather to 
  discuss and provide input as to who should be the Vice Presidential choice. 
  And while they gathered to discuss it the announcement was made on TV as to 
  who McGovern had selected. This is not being thin skinned (although it does 
  provide another example to how easy it is for some to sell out and others to 
  just be suckered by attention). This is not unfairly or incorrectly playing 
  the race/racist card. This is recognizing the deliberate and intentional exclusion 
  of the Black community (they have always gone along before, so why would they 
  protest now, unless it was because this time there is no payoff for the “leaders”). 
  Would this happen in the White community? Do not suburban school boards discuss 
  who will be their superintendent with those who are the majority there, Whites? 
  The statistics in my book show how poorly the schools have served our children, 
  whether with Black or White Superintendents. What is at issue is not the credentials 
  of the new superintendent (the outgoing Black superintendent backed the decision) 
  but the credibility credentials of the state and city in the process and the 
  credentials of the school system in teaching our kids how to read and write 
  and do math at grade level. This entire process smacks of one more attempt to 
  keep local control out in order to control the locals, typical of apartheid 
  systems. It used to be a capital offense to teach Blacks how to read and write 
  or for them to learn. We find it offensive to our kids and our future that the 
  school system continues to greatly underperform in its mission to teach and 
  provide learning. That is the key issue. Academic credentials aside, we want 
  to know the credentials of commitment to reversing the abysmal failure of the 
  MPS system to teach our young. Let’s face the truth: something is wrong with 
  the theories that have been used in education given the results we have to day. 
  These theories have been corrosive and destructive to both our children and 
  our communities. The notion of “liberation” for young Black children in the 
  schools is still a dream. Let’s make the dream a reality. So tell us, school 
  board, how will you turn it around so that the majority of Blacks achieve grade 
  level, not just the majority of Whites? I asked this in my book. I’m still asking 
  it.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #158. September 28, 2003: February 2002: RT Rybak plays snake 
  in the Garden with Minneapolis’ Black Ministers</strong></p>
<p>Snakes are great at making promises and even greater at not keeping them. Mayor 
  Rybak has some real snake oil to sell last February. He talked about bringing 
  a Black in at the senior level when all the while he had cut a deal with the 
  Federation to can Olson and replace him with Lucy Gerold. His selective memory 
  is such that he never talks about the meetings he had with high ranking Black 
  officers. And now we see the slithering again as both Lucy Gerold and Sharon 
  Lubinski are again meeting with Black officers, as they tell them how much they 
  need their support and work in the community, and that they are the person for 
  the Chief’s job and there will be something in it for them if they get their 
  support and win the position.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #157. September 28, 2003: The plan for no plan. Hiding behind 
  the skirts of the “budget crunch” to crunch hiring of Black police officers</strong></p>
<p>Let’s be clear: the city of Minneapolis has no plan to increase Black hiring 
  in the police department. Indeed, the same ‘ol same ‘ol is to keep the old plantation 
  plan: hire as few as they can get away with and hope attrition reduces the ranks 
  “naturally.” There are currently just 46 African Americans in this department, 
  42 males, 4 females, out of nearly 860. This is another example of how “diversity” 
  in definition dilutes Black participation and continues the real plan, deferring 
  the Black dream, as the “minority” hires of significance are women, that is, 
  White women.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #: 156. September 28, 2003The Rhetoric of the RT Rybak Campaign: 
  Safe Streets a high concern, was merely rhetorical, a flourish for votes and 
  a signal to Whites that Blacks would be clamped down on.</strong></p>
<p>In the campaign, the rhetoric was about his concern for diversity, more minority 
  hiring, etc. It was Mayor Rybak’s clever way to criticize what Chief Olson was 
  or was not doing, which was easy to do as there was plenty of blame to go around. 
  But he has had nearly two years, now, and yet nothing has changed numbers wise. 
  Instead, he is falling back on “budget crunch” and to make the governor the 
  bad guy. But Governor Pawlenty doesn’t run the City of Minneapolis. RT Rybak 
  and the city council do, and what they have been doing is giving basic lip service 
  to Black hiring of police, at best. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #155. September 28, 2003: Hey Community Grow Man (or is that just 
  a tambourine you play on?)</strong></p>
<p>Paul Harvey talks about “the rest of the story.” In the same vein, we wonder 
  why Doug Grow of the Strib no longer writes much about “the rest of the community.” 
  For instance, when the State troopers descended upon us recently for the first 
  time in 10 years (see Blog entry #s 74, 81, 87, and 118), they had fewer Blacks 
  on the force than a decade ago. Why not write about all the money and grand 
  ideas that combine in all the Homeland Security money. Where is that money going? 
  Is it going to protect just the Whites? What is the plan for the full community.

<p><strong>Blog #154. September 27, 2003: Taking care not to revise the past so 
  the truth needed for tomorrow doesn’t get tossed out too: It was White actions 
  that led to the decline of Black neighborhoods, not Black actions. Think four 
  words: urban renewal and freeways.</strong></p>
<p>At a recent meeting in the Jordan community, Don Sammuels (on Jim Mork’s web 
  site, <a href="http://www.usfamily.net/web/mirth/violence.html">http://www.usfamily.net/web/mirth/violence.html</a>) 
  states that it was the riots of the 60s (by Blacks) that caused the disintegration 
  of the Black neighborhoods (in other words, they did it to themselves). Don, 
  sincere in his belief is also sincerely wrong. Don came in 1977, so I’m happy 
  here to provide historical perspective. One of the few advantages of being older 
  (and there are few advantages) is that one can comment on events of history 
  that one lived through that others only discuss from filters of others, the 
  latter also often not present. Don said that before the 1960s, the neighborhood 
  capacity was lost by the flight of residents due to the riots. This is patently 
  false. Not a lie, just false, one of the many urban legends used to blame the 
  victims. Let’s be clear: the decline in the economic base did not happen because 
  of the riots of the 60s but because of urban renewal. We must take care not 
  to revise history to shape our own personal and/or political needs, for then 
  we won’t be addressing what is. The economic base had already been destroyed 
  before the riots by urban renewal, starting in the mid-1950s. By 1959, Black 
  businesses (of which there were many and certainly far more than exist today) 
  were wiped out by urban renewal/highways. We did NOT destroy our own community. 
  It was White policy that again helped defer the dream. What was destroyed by 
  the riots in the 60s were businesses owned by Whites as there basically were 
  no Black businesses left. So what does Don speak of, his experiences in Jamaica 
  before he came here in 1977 (or thereabouts) and what reflects his experiences 
  here? I would be delighted to sit down with him to discuss these things, although, 
  as mentioned before, I provide a very complete historical picture in my book.

<p><strong>Blog #153. September 26, 2003: Call To The Minneapolis Black Churches: 
  Become Apart Of The Solution Again, And Give Up Being Part Of The Problem. Be 
  People Of Solution And Resolution To No Longer Defer The Dream So We Can Achieve 
  The Prize.</strong></p>
<p>People have asked me to explain my emphasis in my book on The Golden Rule with 
  my comment in a Spokeman-Recorder interview in its issue of 11-6-02, that &#8220;I’m 
  a person of disbelief.&#8221; </p>
<p>I see no contradiction. As I stated in the 11-6-02 Spokesman-Recorder interview: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I don’t play games, I don’t go to church. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t raised 
    in the church; I have great respect for it&#8230;But I maintain that you only 
    pass this way once. And to pass this way and leave nothing and to do nothing, 
    I think is the greatest insult that you do to yourself as a being and whatever 
    spirit it is that you reach out to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, in the parable of the Good Samaritan, it was the “good people” and 
  the “priests” that passed by on the other side that were the problem. I would 
  love to work with the churches. The problem is that they don’t want to work 
  with me, let alone follow the Golden Rule. I believe the churches would be able, 
  as they were in a former era, to involve themselves in the life of their communities 
  to achieve something transformative for people spiritually and community wise, 
  if they served our people and not their sense of being a part of the local political 
  establishment in general and the DFL in particular. Loyalty to party is wonderful. 
  But not when the party is not loyal to them. Even when the establishment fought 
  us and tried to hold us back in education, jobs, housing, etc., the church, 
  as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. so ably showed us, was there for us. But where 
  is it for us today?</p>
<p>Today, too many ministers and their churches have become part of the problem 
  rather than the solution. Indeed, when my book came out, the Black Ministers 
  Association/Leadership Forum condemned my book, primarily because of what they 
  thought it said. From the hearings held by the national NAACP earlier in September 
  in Minneapolis, we learn that most have never read the book they rail against. 
  Therefore, I urge them to read the book. As I said a year ago in the 11-6-02 
  Spokesman-Recorder interview: &#8220;One of the things that was insisted upon 
  was that we had to authenticate everything, so that when people get ready to 
  be critical or to attack or praise the book, that you can authenticate that 
  which has taken place.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can authenticate. They cannot. So they ban the book without reading it. As 
  I also said in the 11-6-02 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> But the book is also a teaching instrument. Particularly in the latter part 
    of the book, I talk about solutions and resolutions. Everybody maintains that&#8212;and this is one of the criticisms that has emerged far too often for Black 
    America (and it’s used also as a race card, if you will)&#8212;that we bitch and 
    complain and ‘never got no solutions.’ I’ve seen many. I’ve seen many authors 
    in this country&#8212;Cornell West and others. Men of solution and resolution.&#8221; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is available to be used, especially by young people, as one of these 
  solutions. The book is also a resource for getting information that might not 
  otherwise be available. Any church wishing to buy the book in bulk for a study 
  group may do so at a special price of $10 each for orders of 20 or more. And 
  for $25/participant, including the book, Beacon on the Hill Press will hold 
  6 hour seminars on the book and the solutions in the book, for groups of 20 
  or more (or less participants but fee for 20 is the minimum, even with less 
  people). Beacon can be reached through the web site.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #152. September 25, 2003: The Bill of Rights were signed September 
  25, 1789, 214 years ago today.</strong></p>
<p>Where would we be without the Constitution’s Bill of Rights? Under the thumb 
  of the state. Without the Bill of Rights, we’d have few freedoms beyond the 
  freedom to obey the state. Indeed, sixteen of the fifty-five delegates refused 
  to sign the Constitution without the Bill of Rights added, including Patrick 
  Henry and Samuel Adams. Kings can have constitutions. Abuses around he world

<p><strong>Blog #151. September 25, 2003: Have the Democrats no Shame?</strong></p>
<p>On September 18, 2003, the Rev. Jesse Jackson campaigned in California, with 
  Gray Davis, against the recall election and campaigned for California Governor 
  Gray Davis. After Mr. Jackson introduced the governor, Mr. Davis thanked him 
  by calling him &#8220;the strongest voice on civil rights in my lifetime, with the 
  possible exception of Dr. King.&#8221; Possible? There is doubt? Is this how far the 
  Democrats have slid from Nellie Stone Johnson? Jesse Jackson never paid the 
  price in thinking nor in action to be equal to Dr. King. Dr. King dreamed the 
  dream. Jesse Jackson is one who helps defer the dream. I can appreciate and 
  understand why Jesse does what he does. But for a White Democratic Governor 
  to make this claim shows the Democrats have no shame and will pander even more 
  than Jesse does. Now they want to dilute the dream maker King by equating him 
  with the dream stealer Jackson (a preacher who “gets his” by extorting money 
  from corporations and hobnobbing with foreign tyrants). The “possible” is that 
  he has possibly done more to ruin the image and face of Black Americans than 
  anyone else by urging our young men to see themselves as victims rather than 
  victors, as unable rather than able, as unqualified or unqualifyable rather 
  than qualified and qualifyable. Dr. King left us with a living civil rights 
  legacy. Jesse Jackson leaves only his own legacy of profligacy. Dr. King dreamed 
  for all of us. Jesse dreams for himself. Dr. King had Whites believing it was 
  OK for Blacks to be like them, ambitious and striving to get ahead, whereas 
  Jesse has Whites yearning for the time when Blacks were passive, seeing, through 
  Jesse, ambitious Blacks as violent and not to be trusted. </p>

<p><strong><a name="03150b0924"></a>Blog #150. September 24, 2003: Minority Police Officers: Another Version 
  of the Dream Deferred</strong></p>
<p>How many times have we all heard the salesman soften us up by asking us about 
  our concerns about what we have that we want to replace (is not a new model 
  almost always sold to us as newer is better?). But experience is not like metal 
  fatigue. Time may wear a machine down but time is what makes all of us better 
  at what we do. And yet that siren song of the new, the transformed, the changed, 
  always draws us. And so too did RT Rybak to the senior Black police officers 
  when he was a candidate: just talk to me about your concerns about the mayor, 
  let me know how things could be better. This expressed “concern” got him information, 
  sincerely expressed, that was then turned into flame throwers that he used to 
  burn the mayor during the debates. And since he was elected? He won’t give them 
  the time of day. They can’t get a meeting with them. I don’t know about you 
  but I know what kind of message that sends the rest of the police force, and 
  it sends an obvious message to those sitting silenced in the police-community 
  mediation sessions. Even when passed in the hall and stopped to be reminded 
  of the attempts to see him, he responds “innocently” about having to check his 
  schedule and getting right back to them, and then doesn’t. Devious? Cowardly? 
  Doesn’t care? Take your pick. What do you think it is? How would you interpret 
  that treatment if it was directed at you? How is it helping city hall/police 
  relations? How is it helping the mediation between police and community? And 
  how is it helping relations between Black and White police officers?</p>

  Version of the Dream Deferred</strong></p>
<p>Confidentiality now has a new name: stilting. Transparency is lost, communications 
  are prevented, and the process can drag on seemingly forever, as the high sounding 
  concept of confidentiality works for the side that doesn’t want to cooperate 
  or work with the other side, as no information is allowed out to enable everyone 
  else to follow what is going on. 1st amendment rights have many ways of being 
  waived. Mediation should not be one of them. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #148. September 17, 2003: Where should police live? In the city 
  or outside the city? A curious thought. Or maybe not. Maybe there is merit here. 
  It would certainly provide the ultimate in accountability. Is it place of residency 
  or place of of priorities of performance results that count? </strong></p>
<p>There is a curious debate going on suggesting that all police officers, and 
  certainly the chief, should live inside Minneapolis so they would have a stake 
  in their community and somehow provide better service. Why? Is professionalism 
  now something proven only by place of residence? By this logic, all teachers 
  and public school administrators should live in the city. Indeed, they should 
  live in the neighborhoods of the schools in which they work and their kids should 
  go to those schools. And, of course, the real powers of Minneapolis, the bureaucrats 
  who cook up the rules and regulations not thought of by the state legislature 
  or city council, should also ALL live inside the city where the consequences 
  of their work unfold. Hey! On second thought, that’s a great idea. Let’s have 
  ALL city workers live in the city if they are to draw a salary AND lets mandate 
  that they all must spend the first five years of their retirement also living 
  in the city. Can you imagine how great the city would become, overnight, if 
  the services they mandate and execute are the same ones they receive? That would 
  be the ultimate in accountability, would it not? But then, we’d be a dictatorship. 
  The real issue is accountability. The frustration at its lack drives the residency 
  proponents. What they should be driven by is performance accountability, for 
  in the end, it won’t be the residence that counts but the professional performance 
  and the results measured against what the policy makers claim will happen if 
  their policies are followed. When we turn to the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solution areas</a> in my book and hold our professionals accountable 
  in them (education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, governing, 
  ethics), then, and only then, will these be areas of pride for all rather than 
  pride for some while shame for others. It is not place of residence that counts 
  but performance and the place in <span class="alertme">[MISSING TEXT!!!] </span>

<p><strong>Blog #137. September 15, 2003: Another example of the city-DFL-national 
  trough</strong></p>
<p>For those of us concerned about fiscal health, Hollman is merely a symbol of 
  a bad trend in government that tends to get worse, not better. It no longer 
  seems to matter who is in charge, the DFL or the GOP, as the results are the 
  same: bigger trough, more pigs. This is an issue that we, as concerned citizens, 
  need to unite behind regardless of our party affiliations or leanings. What 
  messed the Hollman monies up was the expectation of doing trough business as 
  usual. For instance, in Secretary Russell’s letter that I discuss in my September 
  10 column, he points out that “in February of this year, Congress, in HUD’s 
  FY2003 appropriations legislation, Public Law 108-7, enacted a provision that 
  significantly altered the manner in which Section 8 voucher funds are distributed 
  to housing authorities.” And the city, so used to its collusion with HUD, essentially 
  ignored this. I heard a wonderful phase about an attribute that fits the city 
  and individuals involved in this. It is a phrase from the 19th century literary 
  critic Matthew Arnold that describes this attribute of the DFL and the local 
  branch of the NAACP: that they have a “passionate, turbulent, indomitable reaction 
  against the despotism of fact.” In other words, facts don’t matter, their minds 
  are already made up. The Russell letter had a cover letter from HUD’s trial 
  attorney, Harold J. Rentton, who indicates that despite trying to work with 
  Minneapolis, the Minneapolis response was to ignore HUD (sometimes one party 
  foolishly does this when the other party comes to power, which is not very smart, 
  as this has nothing to do with party but with Minneapolis people, and so our 
  paid government workers, regardless of party, should rise above this). The law 
  was changed regarding how Section 8 voucher funds are to be distributed to housing 
  authorities. The new folks have picked up on the fact that the MPHA misrepresented 
  the amount of dollars they could be set aside by almost $5 million. Misrepresentation 
  is rarely taken well by anyone, especially when they realize the monies have 
  been allocated and spent for something obviously not for what it was intended 
  for. The federal money came, the federal money went, but obviously not to Hollman 
  as intended. The new party in power in Washington is now following the money 
  trail of the old party in power. Thus, the Russell letter pointed out that the 
  city had not been acting “in good faith.” </p>

<p><strong>Blog #136. September 14, 2003: MPHA’s #2 came from Legal Aid. This 
  is bureaucratic incest at its best. </strong></p>
<p>So Tom Strike MPHA’s Deputy Director, who was the attorney for the Hollman 
  project when he was at Legal Aid, has been feeding information to Thompson at 
  Legal Aid. How cozy. They want us to think the left hand doesn’t know what the 
  right hand is doing and that these things “sometimes just happen.” Oh please. 
  The hands know. How? Because they are holding hands. So we get another lesson 
  in Minneapolis City Government 101. In tougher times, say World War II, these 
  guys would have been called quislings, collaborators against country (in this 
  case, the city). But these are easy times. So I won’t call them quislings. I’ll 
  just call them turncoats, snake oil salesmen who open their coats and try to 
  sell us fake watches and fake actions, taking our money either way. And to cap 
  off this shamelessness, Legal Aid is asking to be paid a fee of $300,000 to 
  help make right what it was involved in making wrong. How does this serve the 
  city?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #135. September 13, 2003: 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Part 3 of 4: 
  Pausing to Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American: Supporting 
  Each Other, Not Segregating Each Other</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part III.</strong></p>
<p>Supporting each other in war with many fronts: fighting terrorism, replacing 
  permanent job loss, meeting the need for education and jobs, ending the continued 
  deferred of Black dreams. I still hold out for the positive possibilities for 
  our nation of neighborhoods. </p>
<p>How do we support each other in this era of fighting the war on terrorism and 
  change in economics as manufacturing joins agriculture in permanent and steady 
  loss of jobs, as we work to find the replacement for manufacturing just as manufacturing 
  replaced agriculture? Supporting each other and inviting everyone to the table 
  is the liberating ideal of The American Way although not always the practice, 
  as our miserable failure with slavery, Jim Crow, post 1968 Kerner Commission 
  Report saying Blacks can’t make it on their own, etc. so clearly demonstrate. 
  But we must not let go of the ideal. It is part of the prize on which we have 
  set our eyes. We can read more about our American ideal of supporting each other 
  at http://www.iscv.org/Civic_Idealism/Supporting_One_Another/supporting_one_another.html, 
  which has statements supporting this, from Alexis de Tocqueville to the Declaration 
  of Independence and the Preamble to the Constitution, Washington, Jefferson, 
  Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and Martin Luther King, Jr.). At first they applied to White 
  males, then White women, then to Black professionals. Now I fight to include 
  inner city Blacks and other minorities. An excellent resource place is the web 
  site www.iscv.org (The Institute for the Study of Civic Value), a community 
  based web site. It helps put the question regarding the war on terrorism into 
  perspective:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>How will the War on Terrorism shape America&#8217;s civic values? Already, this 
    new war has united us in a way that we have not experienced since World War 
    II. Will this solidarity remain? What forms will it take?<br>
    On the other hand, will the War Against Terrorism undermine many of the critical 
    civic values that we work to preserve? As an example, will the Bush administration&#8217;s 
    new Department of Homeland Security become a 21st Century version of J.Edgar 
    Hoover&#8217;s FBI? There are real risks here&#8212;but surely it ought to be possible 
    to fight a war against terrorism without becoming terrorists ourselves. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow I will offer a pair of “pathways”, with web sites, that can be followed 
  to maintain our civic liberties and security, the American Way, and do so for 
  We the People, to help us insure that in our war on terrorism we don’t bring 
  terror to innocent citizens. The leadership, White and Black, can run but they 
  can’t hide. The spotlight of justice is upon them. When will they join in that 
  honest discussion of our inner cities and our economy and invite everyone to 
  the table, not just the professional therapists, planners, and other assorted 
  program bureucrats serving their retirement accounts while not being held accountable 
  for denying our access to the table?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #134. September 13, 2003: The City still feeds at the Hollman 
  trough</strong></p>
<p>In my column of September 10, 2003, I discussed the letter from Legal Aid’s 
  Mr. Thompson. What I didn’t mention in my column is that Mr. Thompson recommended 
  that $300,000 be set aside as compensation to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
  But that fund doesn’t do anything for people of color in this town. It is a 
  White liberal feel good fund. Thompson mentions “there has been no single person 
  since the departure of Council President Jackie Cherryhomes with sufficient 
  stature, authority, and commitment to bring all the parties together to assure 
  timely completion.” That is an outrageous statement. Timely? When Jackie left 
  the project was already five years behind (and her taking her city files ensured 
  the fog of secrecy would continue). Is he saying the Mayor has no stature or 
  authority or commitment? Is he saying that the city council members don’t have 
  stature, authority, and commitment? Or is he saying he doesn’t want any non-DFLer 
  to have stature and authority to back their commitments? This can only be a 
  direct shot at new CM Natalie Johnson-Lee, whose office files were spirited 
  away by Jackie Cherryhomes without a word from the Mayor, the city attorney, 
  or the other then all White council members. The DFL, in its eagerness to get 
  rid of Green Party candidates is willing to attack the messengers. There was 
  a saying in the “old West” that “the only good Indian was a dead Indian.” We 
  now see that the Democrats see the only good minorities are dead Greens or dead 
  Republicans, politically speaking. They seem to only want equal access for minorities 
  if they are “good minorities,” i.e., DFL. And that’s one of the reasons they 
  kicked out DFL co-founder Nellie Stone Johnson. I’m a Nellie Stone Johnson Democrat. 
  So I’m not surprised by their behavior. And I’m not surprised that the only 
  advocate for Hollman/Heritage Park as it was meant to be is now the Judge, not 
  the Mayor, not MPHA, not Legal Aid, not the city council. They have all contributed 
  to killing the affordable housing dream. How much longer will they be able to 
  get away with this? </p>
<p> But the trough is not limited to the DFL. Nationally, the GOP has hiked the 
  number of pigs and expanded the size of the trough by increasing domestic discretionary 
  spending 20.8 percent (.7% under Clinton) with even more people working directly 
  and indirectly for the federal government. This is what I call “the debt gamble.” 
  Certainly airport and other security measures and the War on Terror on part 
  of this. However the solutions must go, they must include America’s inner city, 
  they must include allowing everyone at the table. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #133. September 12, 2003: 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Part 2 of 4: 
  Pausing to Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American: Not Giving 
  Up our Bill of Rights And Become What We Fight.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Part II.</strong></p>
<p>Part I is Blog Entry #131. The second issue is that of Homeland Security and 
  our Bill of Rights. This is a real national defense political tightrope we must 
  walk. We now live in a time when their are “sleeper cells” in our midst. This 
  creates threats to us that if not handled correctly will create threats to our 
  Bill of Rights. These are hard, agonizing questions. Supporting each other is 
  he American way/tradition, not searching each other (the un-American way). Hence 
  the agony and the dilemma. A nation (US) and state (Minnesota) that allows the 
  power grid to become so decrepit that rural schools and the outer suburbs had 
  to close for a day earlier this month because of a “brown out” is about local 
  and wider than local governments that have forgotten its people. We must never 
  forget that the heart and soul of this country is We the People. </p>
<p>Just because 9-11 washed away the “we’ve got it made” post-cold war era of 
  1989 – 2001, doesn’t mean that we can wash away what we stand for in a cold 
  bath of fear. We, as a country, still stand for the best and do so better than 
  any other. We will endure. We will prevail. But only if we do it together, with 
  everyone at the table. This is not the time to exchange sacrifice for compassion, 
  or deferment again for our progress. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
  We can defend our homeland and what makes our home something we sing about as 
  “this land is our land,” our freedom, our liberty, our Bill of Rights. This 
  is what matters. It is what gives us the integrity of a democratic society and 
  a model to emulate to the world. We must be “always vigilant.” But out of good 
  cause, not paranoia. This means we must be vigilant not to let our civil liberties 
  collapse under the understandable desire for action nor let our love for our 
  civil liberties block the authorities from being vigilant with those showing 
  cause to be investigated. 
<p>We owe a debt to our people first while at the same time protecting them against 
  those who would take the country away. As Nellie Stone Johnson said, “no jobs, 
  no education, no peace in America.” That has to be our concern. Not just peace 
  for the country as a whole but for its parts as well, including peace in the 
  inner citeis. And who could help lead the way in our inner city Black communities? 
  The NAACP. But will they? More importantly, can they? Not the way they are behaving 
  today (see &#8220;July 21, 2003 NAACP Takes Eye off Prize&#8221; Solution Paper on this 
  web site). The local branch of the NAACP has also taken its eye off the prize 
  of freedom for all. Indeed, as demonstrated by the local branch of the NAACP 
  on Saturday the 6th of this month, the White power structure has the Black leadership 
  whipped into line in this city (as in the country). They no longer stand for 
  us. When will others join me in having an honest discussion about these issues? 
  I have laid it out in my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes” and 
  in the Solution Papers on this web site (“The 7 Solutions”). The leadership, 
  White and Black, can run but they can’t hide. The spotlight of justice is upon 
  them. When will they join in that honest discussion? It is one thing to say 
  to the Justice Department, after 9-11, “don’t let this happen again.” It is 
  another thing to take our civil liberties away without reason to protect them 
  and then have the NAACP take them away in our local elections.</p>
<p>We are now at the point where talk won’t cut it. The Justice Department and 
  the NAACP both have to perform their way to credibility. Insincerity talks. 
  Credibility walks. We can tell the difference between these by whether or not 
  everyone is invited to the table. That is my definition. What is yours?</p>

  Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American: Part 1 of 4: Not Supporting 
  Iraq at the Expense of the U.S. but Parallel to the U.S.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part I.</strong></p>
<p>9-11-01 changed the United States and world (their war protestors this year 
  represented the majority of their people whereas ours represented a minority 
  of our people). Certainly there would have been no war without 9-11, when we 
  were forced to finally give relevance to the mad men tyrannizing their people 
  and their neighbors and ourselves. But our response is at the expense of our 
  dream, to once again defer our aspirations. We may debate how and when and where 
  what we did/are doing in Iraq but there can be no debate about what they did 
  on 9-11 and what their intention continues to be. But as Paul Harvey says, there 
  is also “the rest of the story.” The full story is not just that because now 
  a few men with a few thousand dollars can wreak the havoc of 9-11, we live in 
  the era of pre-emption, in which this war would be waged regardless of which 
  party occupied the White House. But the rest of the story is how we got here. 
  Both political parties have been involved in making Saddam a friend of ours, 
  even while he was invading Iran, even when he was killing his own people, especially 
  the Kurds and later the Shiites. That means there are unanswered questions that 
  make up the rest of the 9-11 story. But the answers to these questions must 
  be answered within the context of making sure there is a place at the table 
  for all Americans (see my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” pp. 
  106, 297, 302, 328, and for fun, 271).</p>
<p>The first question is about the spending of billions of dollars to remake Iraq 
  while our inner cities are allowed to decay or funds spent are on White bureaucrats 
  and planners managing the decay. We fed and helped Europe rebuild after World 
  War I and again with the Marshall Plan in World War II. Where is the Marshall 
  Plan for our inner cities? Where is the GI Bill for education for the service 
  of those who descend from the service of slaves? Patriotic fervor is fine, and 
  we all sing “God Bless America” and “America the Beautiful” and “The Battle 
  Hymn of the Republic.” But where is “We shall overcome” and “Amazing Grace” 
  and “His Eye Is On The Sparrow?” Saddam and guys like Norreiga and Pinoche and 
  others were our “friends” at the expense of their people when it suited the 
  purpose of this country. The $87 billion asked for Monday night is twice what 
  we are spending on Homeland Security and 50% more that we are spending on education. 
  We stood by and allowed brutality and genocide in Eastern Europe and Africa, 
  even as we did in the Middle East. Those are concerns but not my chief concern. 
  My chief concern is the brutality and violence in the inner city. My concern 
  is that White America still stands by and ignores the inner city neighborhoods 
  of Black Americans except when it can use it to create jobs for White therapeutic 
  and planning professionals.</p>
<p>Let’s use a baseball term: the doubleheader. Let’s address the rest of the 
  story and have a double header so that we address also the loss of jobs, about 
  which a report released Monday of this week by the Federal Reserve stated that 
  the lost jobs won’t come back, &#8220;permanent changes in the economy mean new economic 
  sectors will need to be created to revitalize the labor market.” In 1900, agriculture, 
  that once employed 80% of Americans, enjoyed productivity increases that eventually 
  enabled 8% to do more than the 80% did before. Now manufacturing is going through 
  the same development: more and more products being manufactured with fewer and 
  fewer laborers. The world’s economy squeezes profits from wages rather that 
  stopping the over production of existing goods no longer needed in that quantity 
  and finding new sectors to create jobs in that won’t squeeze workers. I want, 
  dollar for dollar, the rebuilding of America’s inner cities as well as the American 
  economy as a whole to parallel the rebuilding of Iraq. Without that emphasis 
  of funding our ball game over here, I’m not interested in funding their ball 
  game over there. Tomorow: the second issue: Homeland Security and the Bill of

<p><strong>Blog #130. September 11, 2003: Response 4 of 4 regarding Eric Mitchell&#8217;s 
  wondering if Ron Edwards has anything to say about bigotry. You’re kidding, 
  right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part IV.</strong></p>
<p>For Parts I-III, see Blog entries #125, #126, #127 Minneapolis now has Somalis 
  in town. They came here to escape the civil war in Somalia, where Blacks were 
  killing Blacks, not because they are Black but because they don’t support “the 
  other side.” The Somalia civil war is cultural (Islam against Christians) and 
  political (over which tribe or group should control). Since the 17th century, 
  almost ALL immigrants to this country were running from the prejudices and bigotry 
  and discrimination and racism of their home land (in the 19th century, the Irish 
  were considered “a different race,” hence the shop window signs in Boston said 
  “No Irish Need Apply.” As for the statement that the Somalis “have a belief 
  system and culture that preclude anti-social behaviors,” well, what can I say? 
  Somalis are not robots. No group is. There is NO such thing as a culture or 
  belief system that precludes anti-social behaviors. Why respond to every outlandish 
  claim? There is work to do. All groups argue against anti-social behaviors (or 
  at least against the group or sub-group) but that has never stopped any group 
  or sub-group from doing so. Certainly no parent with teenagers can make the 
  claim that their culture or belief system precludes their teens from anti-social 
  behavior.</p>
<p>And lets not dodge the bullet here: Radical Islam (whether by Somalis, Arabs, 
  Indonesians, Whites, Blacks) want an Islamic world. In every country, including 
  the U.S., where there are those who are of Radical Islam (as opposed to moderate 
  Islam), all have stated that they want their new country to become Islamic and 
  will work for that. But that is another topic for another day. My point here 
  is to encourage every one to learn of and leave their ignorance so they can 
  reduce their own bigotry, prejudices, and racism, and end discrimination, and 
  thus hold everyone, White or Black, native born or immigrant, Christian, Jew, 
  Muslim or nothing, to live according to the rules and laws of this nation and 
  follow the basics of upholding the rights outlined in the Constitution and especially 
  the Bill of Rights, for everyone. That is my goal. Provide it for everyone and 
  you provide it for your group and your self. This is clear in my book. If people 
  would read my book rather than act in a knee jerk kind of way to be the messenger 
  boys and water carriers for the DFL, where the messengers look silly and the 
  DFL behind the scenes puppeteers go unscathed. When will the messengers learn? 
  My goal remains the same: a seat at the table for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #129. September 10, 2003: Hey Dean: what was the environmental 
  and probative value of digging up the Hollman playground? Will you tell us?</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the entire playground was dug up at Hollman/Heritage Park. Since 
  then Dean Carlson has written that all is fine environmentally and every other 
  wise. So I’m puzzled as to how it can be said that all is in order. What did 
  they find, Dean, when they dug up the playground? What did it tell them about 
  the black goo? What tests were run on it and what were the results? When will 
  we get a third party independent testing? What is your assurance that such testing 
  won’t be “gamed,” which is why there are those calling for testing from a firm 
  that is out of state? Cementing over goo and gunk (I’ve run the video tape on 
  my TV show), watering the dust daily, etc., makes inquiring minds wonder. Now 
  we get the digging up of the entire playground (a sample to test, yes, but all 
  of it)? What’s missing here?. In Blog entry #116, I discuss the strategy of 
  choice of this city, “deny, deny, deny.” Honesty is not a strategy, it is a 
  necessity. Without it there is no credibility. We now have a huge credibility 
  gap. And thus because either you or the city or McCormack Baron or Braun Intertec 
  say it is no longer enough. You may be correct. But the credibility gap won’t 
  let us get there. But given the history of illnesses I discuss in my book before 
  the current construction project and the most recent reports afterwards, you’ll 
  forgive me if I don’t trust what you or the city say. For a place that is without 
  problems, your agency is sure going to great lengths to do different things. 
  For examples, see my Blog entries #44, #62, #102, #103 and #114 below). So we 
  want to know: are we getting the truth or a cover up? We know eventually the 
  truth will out. Will it come from you, the city, McCormack Baron, Braun Intertec 
  or some other organization or not is the question. We can handle the truth and 
  can accept the truth, especially if it comes from an independent third party 
  (preferably from University or out of state) but we won’t accept a cover up, 
  which, so far, is what all of this activity looks like. The ball is in your 
  court.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #128. September 10, 2003: Response 3 of 4 to Eric Mitchell&#8217;s wondering 
  if Ron Edwards has anything to say about bigotry. You’re kidding, right? </strong></p>
<p><strong>PART III.</strong></p>
<p>For Part I see Blog entry #??? And for Part II see Blog entry #???Apparently 
  Eric felt the comparison of Somalis with American Blacks was flagrantly bigoted. 
  “Bigot” and “bigotry” refer to someone who is “obstinately or intolerantly devoted 
  to his own opinions and prejudices.” In that sense, both Eric and the writer 
  he complains about, N.I. Krasnov, demonstrate bigotry. Never forget the wisdom 
  of the saying “opposite in content is the same process.” Prejudiced, as in preconceived 
  judgment or opinion? Of course. But so are Eric’s comments about my book. Racist? 
  Of course not, because Somalis and us are both Black. Culturalist? Of course. 
  Discriminatory? Ah, now we are getting somewhere. Up till now, free speech was 
  in play. I support free speech even when I oppose the view. But I don’t support 
  discrimination, which is about actions, based on bigoted/prejudiced/racist views. 
  Now let’s cut to the chase: ignorance? Yes, of course, but so too is Eric about 
  my book. So let’s look at ignorance, which this certainly was: it is nearly 
  devoid of any historical and anthropological understanding. Ignorance is not 
  in itself bigoted or racist but it leads to them and alone or together they 
  lead to discrimination (slavery, apartheid, Jim Crow, etc.). First, the general 
  charge that I don’t discuss bigotry (prejudice/discrimination/racism too?) shows, 
  hello, ignorance of my book. I discuss them throughout my book. Let me flip 
  open my book. On p. 179 I write about racism in city government. Pick your own 
  page. There it is. So once again I have to ask: why do people comment on my 
  book without reading it? This takes away any way to have an objective discussion. 
  The chapter on justice and fairness, Chapter 5, again outlines clearly the existence 
  of these White attributes in Minneapolis. Interludes 2 and 10 report the reports 
  of them in the Star Tribune and Mpls.St.Paul Magazine. So these attributes of 
  bigotry/prejudice/ racism that lead to discrimination, call them what you will 
  are, per se, not news. Now we even sent Eric a copy of my book. We do hope he 
  gets a chance to read it and then instead of me or instead of my publisher pointing 
  out where topics of concern are located, he can help do so too. I look forward 
  to that. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #127. September 9, 2003: Can Vikings move? &#8220;Without a doubt,&#8221; 
  says Red McCombs in Strib yesterday, &#8220;Without a doubt.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The University of Mn announces it will build an on-campus stadium. An alum 
  announces a $35 million matching gift to build that stadium. The Legislature 
  says it will work up a bill to help. And Red says no stadium no stay. This, 
  of course is part of “The Plan.” In my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes,” I subtitle Chapter 15 “Say Goodbye to the Vikings: They Are Leaving. 
  That is the Plan.” The silence of the Strib until now verifies for me that they 
  are in on the grand scheme. See my earlier pieces on Blog entries #31, 32, 91, 
  94, and 100 below. We’re proud of the fact that these entries have apparently 
  gotten the so-called mainstream media to finally write about it, even as they 
  continue to hedge and community columns like Doug Grow’s write enraptured about 
  the wild when there is plenty wild stuff going on in Minneapolis that needs 
  covered. As I say in my book, Chapter 15, p. 254, “So they have made sure that 
  the Vikings are leaving. I will show you how they did it. It will be our loss. 
  But the powers do love the University of Minnesota Gophers, so they will be 
  the ones to get a new stadium. The Twins will get a renovated Metrodome.” About 
  Red the Strib reported that “McCombs said he’s inclined to let the courts make 
  the call if it comes to that.” The lease clearly has an escape clause: a penalty 
  clause, which requires so many millions paid per year left, which, with 8 years 
  left is chump change in a deal of this magnitude. The so-called “Rozelle letter” 
  is merely a gesture.</p>
<p> We still live in a land that respects private property, as we should. The 
  team is owned by Red. He didn’t sign the lease. An owner, if he pays the penalty, 
  is free to do what he wants with his own property. The NFL “won’t voluntarily” 
  allow the team to go is a cop out, as either the court or the owner can do so 
  and, in this case, both. As he should be able to. And will Red relocate without 
  a new statium? He said “Without a doubt. Without a doubt,” saying it twice for 
  emphasis (which he wouldn’t say without having check with his attorneys. Both 
  Red and the NFL know the Vikings are heading for L.A. The Strib knows this. 
  As I report in my book, one of their reporters, Jay Weiner, in his book “Stadium 
  Games” states that the legislative and business leaders want only three teams, 
  and so one has to go, and that team is the Vikings, which was also said by Henry 
  Savelkoul, former Metropolitan Sports Facility Commission chairman (p. 259). 
  The Strib, rather than leading the charge to keep the team, serves as cheerleader 
  (either by commission or omission) for their leaving. </p>

  if Ron Edwards has anything to say about bigotry. You’re kidding, right? </strong></p>
<p><strong>PART II.</strong></p>
<p>See Blog entry #125 For Part I. Now, Part II: about the Somalis. While Eric 
  comments, I have been in the field working with the Somali community on a wide 
  array of issues and events for five years, including the recent killing of Somali 
  cab drivers on the streets of Minneapolis. I haven’t seen Eric there. I invite 
  any and all who are concerned to join us in working with the Somalis. And yes, 
  people have attempted to drive a wedge between the Somalis and American Blacks. 
  Three weeks ago we all met together at the Urban League and then shared in a 
  press conference at the Urban League Family Day, and have continued to work 
  to maintain a tightness and to heal any wounds that may have opened. Just because 
  the Star Tribune, the Pioneer Press and the Democratic Party does not report 
  these events doesn’t mean they aren’t happening. We continue to work together 
  regardless of the attitudes or slights from the press or the DFL. </p>
<p>I’ve been meeting with the Somalis and the Elders in this town for the last 
  5 years on differences and am pleased with the progress. These are good people. 
  The animosity between our groups started over American brothers hitting on the 
  Somali brothers’ women, which they take as an affront to their culture and their 
  religion. That is being addressed. And yes there are Somali gangs. But every 
  group, including Whites, have gangs, especially immigrant groups. That’s the 
  history (check out the movie “Gangs of New York”). The mainstream of all groups 
  don’t like the gangs of any color or ethnic group, including gangs of their 
  own people, and we and the Somalis are no different on that. As noted below, 
  I have an open invitation to talk to anyone concerned with community. We’d love 
  to have Eric on board. And as for how to solve all of these problems, I draw 
  your attention to my Solution Paper, &#8220;Seven Problems and their Solutions For 
  Stopping the Deferment of the Dream in order to Actualize The Dream,&#8221; on my 
  web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, a paper some are already calling a Minneapolis 
  Agenda for Change. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #125. September 8, 2003: Eric Mitchell wrote: “I guess Ron Edwards 
  doesn’t have a chapter in his book on old fashioned bigotry.” You’re kidding, 
  right? Response 1 of 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>PART I</strong></p>
<p>It has been called to my attention that Eric Mitchell, in a post to the Mpls.Forum 
  Email discussion group of E-Democracy, has asked if there is anything in my 
  book against bigotry because no comment was made by me regarding the example 
  used suggesting that as Somali’s were fine upstanding people North side Blacks 
  could be too. Eric said, about the “godsend” comment regarding the Somalis of 
  N.I. Krasnov, that Somalis “show Whites that Black people moving into a neighborhood 
  is not defacto synonymous with crime” because the Somalis “have a culture and 
  belief system that preclude anti-social behaviors” is “the most overtly bigoted 
  remarks I’ve seen on here “ and then says “I guess Ron Edwards doesn’t have 
  a chapter in his book on old fashioned bigotry.”</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I spend my time in the community, not reading the Issues 
  Forum, as wonderful and useful as it is, and so I appreciate those who draw 
  my attention to various posts. But I can’t respond to all of them. I appreciate 
  it when my publisher does to some. But Eric has been so attentive to my book 
  lately that I did want to pause to respond to this report of his concern. I 
  hope after he reads my book he calls me and we can sit down and talk about his 
  concerns. To that end, I had my publisher send him a book. Had he read it he 
  would not have made that statement. I&#8217;ll outline this in my next three commentaries 
  on Eric&#8217;s comments and indicate relevant places in my book that address Eric&#8217;s 
  concern.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, in Part II, I’ll discuss the Somalis. The day after that, in Part 
  III: a discussion of the concept of ignorance and how it leads to of bigotry, 
  prejudice, and racism, which in turn lead to discrimination, whether de jure 
  (legally, as in Jim Crow) or defacto (done anyway, as in the efforts after the 
  1968 Kerner Commission Report (see Blog entries #99 and #113) said we weren’t 
  capable of making it on our own. Finally, in Part IV, I’ll discuss the Somalis 
  again and what this discussion means and what we should do about it.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #124. September 7, 2003: NAACP still wears its “emperor’s new 
  clothes.” The NAACP marches naked, thinking it is robed in sheep’s clothing 
  while we see the naked wolf helping to defer our dream</strong></p>
<p>On my TV show Sunday, September 2nd, I discussed the fact that Tom White, the 
  attorney for the NAACP thought the newly elected Chair of the Housing Committee, 
  Alisha Clemens, was a member of the Gallman faction and would “do as she was 
  told” (how is it that certain Blacks now want to keep us in our place just as 
  the Whites do?). White wanted her to sign a series of false documents to the 
  court stating that scattered site housing had already been built when in fact 
  it had not been. In his conversation he stated matter of factly, demonstrating 
  how routine this is and how it is felt that it can be done with impunity, that 
  this was not the first time the local NAACP branch had submitted false information 
  to the court. But she, like many, is not a puppet. She is within her rights 
  to file a motion with the court, as she has standing as Chair of the local NAACP 
  Housing Committee, to ask for a special hearing based on the suggested conduct 
  and admitted past conduct of the attorney for the NAACP local branch. Clearly 
  the NAACP has stepped over the felony line with others involved, guilty by either 
  collusion or conspiracy or both. If I hear about it, one can only wonder who 
  else has heard about it, which would have to include the court hearing about 
  it too.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #123. September 6, 2003: NAACP hearing today, Saturday, September 
  6, 2003, has an unintended consequence: it puts the National NAACP “on trial” 
  as well</strong></p>
<p>The national NAACP are sending their local big guns a three member delegation, 
  assistant general counsel, regional director of all field operation, and State 
  Conference President Claudie Washington. But they will first have a series of 
  meetings with the NAACP national people themselves. They have put the National 
  NAACP in a spot: to support the branch and become a known participant in the 
  cover ups of the local branch including felonious acts and malfeasance/misappropriation 
  of funds if they go along with the local action to ban me, or censure them for 
  their acts. So the Saturday meeting is not just Ron Edwards on “trial;&#8221; so too 
  is the integrity of the national organization. A year ago, for example, the 
  branch attempted to appeal Judge Rosenbaum’s decision to allow HUD to no longer 
  be a party to the Hollman consent decree. The local branch made the appeal without 
  ever bringing it before the membership and without informing us. The documents 
  show that the NAACP contested the action and decision of Judge Rosenbaum. Their 
  appeal was dismissed. This was never shared with the general membership as it 
  was supposed to be. So the local has put the national on the spot. Now we&#8217;ll 
  find what the national is made of.</p>

  One Worlders? Not Yet. But we community activists will continue to pursue our 
  ideal. And we in Minneapolis have an AGENDA for change for doing so.</strong></p>
<p>Mother Jones magazine has some interesting things to say about community activists 
  that I have long maintained, that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>People, and nations, are not altruism machines&#8212;never have been, never 
    will be&#8212;and it is about time activists learned to live with this fact 
    rather than endlessly, generation after generation, trying to ignore it or 
    wish it away. To say this is in no way to disparage activists. Without them 
    the world would be even more savage and cruel than it already is. But most 
    people commit their lives to their families and, at most, can be mobilized 
    only occasionally in the name of some ideal. They are quite comfortable seeing 
    themselves as citizens of a specific locality, not as global citizens.</p>
  <p>&#8230;such founding U.N. documents as the Charter and the Universal Declaration 
    of Human Rights were nothing more than empty stipulations of collective moral 
    ambitions. By any objective criterion, the world remained the same tragic 
    place it had always been, as unredeemed by international law as it had been 
    by religion, or Marxism, or liberal capitalism.” </p>
</blockquote>

  We learned of the article from the August 25, 2003 blog of http://regionsofmind.blog-city.com</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I pursue the ideal that I outline in Chapter 5 of my book, &#8220;The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,&#8221; and the calculus for judging how well we 
  are doing, the YESes and NOs. Many in Minneapolis pursue the ideal (albeit often 
  a different ideal, which is why mine includes the &#8220;common ground&#8221; of the YESes 
  and NOs). As Mother Jones says, without activists pursuing an ideal, “the world 
  would be even more savage and cruel than it already is. “ And yet America, in 
  comparison to the rest of the countries of the world, is the closest to the 
  ideal of any country in the world, and although the climb remains steep and 
  long, I remain bullish on Minneapolis (as I state on p. 294 of my book). I still 
  believe we can write a story that reflects the ideals of all, whether the “all” 
  are inspired by religion, Marxism, liberal capitalism, international law, or 
  other frame of reference. And as an activist, I believe there is a solution, 
  which I have outlined in my recent Solution Paper, which is my agenda for 
  the future, my agenda for change: “7 Themes, 7 Problems, 7 Solutions: For Solving 
  the Problems of America&#8217;s Inner Cities: IN ORDER TO STOP DEFERRING THE DREAM

<p>The question has been asked: what is local government for? I believe these

  and what to do with the results we find. My answer is in my paper entitled <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">“The 
  7 Key Themes, 7 Key Problems, and 7 Key Solutions for Solving the Problems of

  and to Actualize It.</p>
<p>Click on &#8220;Solution Papers&#8221; and then click on &#8220;7 Problems and Their Solutions.&#8221; 
  I wrote this new &#8220;Solution Paper&#8221; because of people continually askiing me 
  to articulate what I think are solutions to the problems facing us in Minneapolis 
  today. When asked I just sigh. After 40 years of trying orally, I still got 
  asked. So, to make it known, I resorted to writing my book, “The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes,” complete with solution suggestions. And I still got 
  asked. So I started my web page with my daily web log. And I still got asked. 
  But I’m patient. So I’ll try again. My main themes spring from the words of 
  DFL co-founder, Nellie Stone Johnson: “No education, no jobs, no housing.”</p>
<p>What follows is based on my book and has references to its pages, chapters, 
  and interludes, as well as to my weekly columns. It is also a kind of agenda, 
  open to any to use, whether public or private sector, whether volunteer or paid. 
  Those who outline problems should recommend solutions. That is what the book 
  did. That is what this new Solution Paper does. As I wrote in my book, &#8220;I 
  am bullish on Minneapolis.&#8221; I write not about what is wrong so much as what 
  can make it better. The dream has been deferred too long for those in the inner 
  cities. Read carefully, because as you do, you&#8217;ll see that deferring it for 
  Blacks also defers it for Whites.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #118. September 1, 2003: We don’t want state troopers serving 
  as the new vanguard of the new Black leaders serving the Mastahs under the culture 
  of honor and not conscience</strong></p>
<p>We understand the effort of RT Rybak and the down town bosses to try to raise 
  up new Black leaders to do their bidding, given the loss of credibility in the 
  old group. Lets not repeat the past that we know won’t deliver for the Blacks 
  of North Minneapolis (although it will deliver for the massas). We know the 
  game. We explained this colonial/plantation view in our book “The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes” The majority of us stand for the progress made in this 
  great country and stand for continuing that progress, not reversing it, and 
  bringing it to this last outpost of plantation mentality: America’s inner city 
  in general and Minneapolis in particular. Pulling in state troopers is not the 
  answer (only one state trooper is African American, and he is in Duluth; this 
  is down from two ten years ago). We are not fooled. They can ignore my book 
  but they can’t ignore the truth in the book, for that truth will eventually 
  set us free. If they want progress, the solutions are in the book (which some 
  of the city council not only refuse to read but have sent back the copiesof 
  the book sent to them; see #69 below). The NAACP is not on board either (see 
  web log entry below #89). No matter. We are watching. I state again: we are 
  not fooled. We will continue to be the watchmen for fairness and justice. We 
  will continue to urge adoptions of the solutions laid out in my book. We know 
  Americans can do better, that Minneapolis can do better, than to perpetuate 
  the old school approach of violating our trust and betraying our people.</p>
