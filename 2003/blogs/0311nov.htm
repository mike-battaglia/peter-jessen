<p><strong>Blog #238.  November 2003: Connecting the dots regarding beliefs and 
  visions: peacefully or violently? for the people or against them? </strong>
<p>We are reminded of British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s July statement that 
  the U.S. Pentagon “has been more effective at killing and disrupting the terrorists 
  than [the] State Department has been at promoting an alternative vision to the 
  Mideast status quo.” 
<p>The greatest force for “unrest and disturbance” (see my Chapter 16) is what 
  Jerry Brown calls the “hegemony of the status quo.” Will our Minneapolis inner 
  city neighborhoods be freed to be peaceful or forced by city regulations and 
  containment policies to have to be dealt with by using the vision of police 
  and clubs rather than the beliefs and law followingn of of civil rights? 
<p>In London November 19, President Bush said “&#8221;We must shake off decades of failed 
  policy in the Middle East.” So too must we shake off decades of failed policy 
  in inner city Minneapolis. President Bush told the Britons &#8220;Your nation and 
  mine in the past have been willing to make a bargain: to tolerate oppression 
  for the sake of stability.&#8221; He added &#8220;it is not realism to suppose that one-fifth 
  of humanity is unsuited to liberty; it is pessimism and condescension, and we 
  should have none of it.&#8221; The same should be made to be true in inner city Minneapolis: 
  to no longer tolerate the oppressive status quo to keep the status quo. See 
  my Chapter 16. 
<p>The political parties have both been willing, especially the DFL that politically 
  controls Minneapolis, to tolerate our misery for the sake of its stability. 
  It is not realistic to expect Blacks to accept the conclusions of Whites in 
  the Kerner Commission Report and the book The Bell Curve that we are unsuited 
  to self-reliance, that we forever will need their support and direction. The 
  fastest growing group entering the the middle class in the United States is 
  Blacks. It is time to include Minnesota. It is pessimistic, condescending and 
  false to say we can’t make it on our own. 
<p>Look what Blacks have achieved in this country, despite the shackles. Now is 
  time to release the rest of the shackles creating the tremendous gaps between 
  Blacks and Whites, especially in Minneapolis, in education (Chapter 7), Housing 
  (Chapter 8), and Jobs (Chapter 9). To do so, use the <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">Minneapolis 
  Table Building Blocks</a> to engage in the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a>.

<p><strong>Blog #237. November 23, 2003: Cora McCorvey problems with the lawful 
  in-laws </strong></p>
<p>Hey, what’s up with the story that Corey McCorvey, the Executive Director of 
  the MPHA (Minneapolis Public Housing Authority) had some problems with her in-laws 
  such that they had to call the police and ask her to leave their home? We all 
  have problems. But she is the head of an agency. In trying to cover this up 
  what else, we ask, has she covered up at MPHA? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #236. November 23, 2003: NAACP Wears No Clothes Regarding Mr. 
  Porter, Standing as a mute, granite statue, unmoving.</strong></p>
<p>Most in our community are aware of the fact that the local NAACP branch has 
  not taken a position on the accusation of Mr. Porter regarding the alleged use 
  of a plunger on him in that area of his anatomy where the sun don’t shine. It 
  continues to play it safe by saying nothing. This is another outrage. They are 
  as lazy as the Star Tribune, doing no investigative work to establish a position, 
  one way or the other. Their silence on the alleged sexual attacks on Mr. Porter 
  and on Mr. Jenkins in the county jail are noted. I am not calling for a rush 
  to judgment. They will each get their day in court. The issue is the accusation 
  itself. I am calling for the NAACP to immediately take a stand on police conduct, 
  to make it clear that plungering and other acts are unacceptable. The NAACP 
  should be calling on the police to immediately and publicly say so, even while 
  the investigation continues as to the veracity of the charge. And how long does 
  it take to investigate such charges? Let us hope the answer is not as long as 
  it takes for the matter to be forgotten. We will not, however, forget. But maybe 
  the NAACP’s silence is not a mystery after all, as the community is as aware 
  of how the NAACP participated in the Flowers beating just as they helped in 
  the cover up of the death of Christopher Verns on November 1, 2002. </p>

<p><strong>Blog 235. November 21, 2003: The race card is played on the offensive 
  line. Wrong game. This is football, not a presidential election</strong></p>
<p>Change is hard, isn’t it? Now, as a coach, who do you play in a game? The best? 
  Or just the best Whites? Martin Luther King would say the best, White or Black. 
  Before Coach Tice, the defensive unit was all Black. Because they were Black? 
  No. Because they were the best on defense. But Coach Tice is reputed as saying 
  he didn’t want all eleven players on defense to be Black. So they play these 
  White guys, Russell and Becket. Now the White guys aren’t bad. They could make 
  any college team. But this isn’t college. They are making errors that are costing 
  the team dearly. The other teams are eating them up. The Giants first discovered 
  this weakness and exploited it. And so Green Bay and San Diego picked up on 
  what the Giants did. So the old Revolutionary slogan “don’t fire until you see 
  the Whites of their eyes” has been changed to “don’t hire until you see the 
  White of their skin. They can be picked apart by good quarterbacks, and that 
  is what is happening. How long before the developing friction between players 
  who want to win and players who can’t win causes a melt down? Perhaps we get 
  a hint about what is going from the comment made by Tom Benarde of KQRS regarding 
  his asking why the Vikings would draft a Daunte Culpepper who had been born 
  in a penitentiary and must, therefore, be at the lower end of the gene pool? 
  Is pro-bowl playing and record speaks for itself. But for Benarde, it isn’t 
  qualifications that speak, its color. Needless to say, people of color are just 
  enraged that the White media has closed down on it, giving Benarde a free pass: 
  not a peep from them. Sports writer Tom Sansavere was with Bernard when he made 
  the statement and Sansavere hasn’t said a word. Daunte, a pro-bowler with his 
  own radio show and serious community work with adopted kids is a young man any 
  would be proud to call son or friend. I can’t say the same about guys like Benarde 
  or Sansavere. And what’s with Tice grabbing Black players by their face masks 
  or condescendingly hitting them on their helmets, but not doing so with White 
  players, such as Hovan, Beckett or Russell? </p>

<p><strong>Blog 234. November 21, 2003: Vikings Queens Have Dethroned the Kings</strong></p>
<p>Given our discussion on the importance of leaders showing high expectations 
  to get high performance (Blog #216), Vikings owner Red McCombs continues his 
  one man wrecking crew job on a team that for nearly a decade was King of the 
  Hill. As players and coach stood quiet while being berated by Red, they lost 
  their crowns. Coach didn’t stand up for his players. The players didn’t stand 
  up for themselves. And so once again an owner, with only a fan base of one to 
  please, himself, has shown how an owner can sabotage his own team while his 
  Coach shows him players that when the chips are down he’ll let them down, making 
  the sabotage complete. So we have a White Coach standing by playing the role 
  of the passive whipping boss while the White owners flails his team. So now 
  they have adopted the Steppin Fetchit approach to survive as the Coach now has 
  shown that he serves not the team but the plantation paymaster. That might have 
  worked in the fields but we no longer work that way. Men must standup for each 
  other, regardless of color. For the coach to say the owner can say what he wants 
  is very old Texas slave South. Its not 21st century. Now before people begin 
  to scream that I am playing the race card, think again. I am not playing the 
  race card. Red McCombs already played it, as did Coach Tice. I’m merely reporting 
  on their play. I am merely calling the miserable scene the miserable scene that 
  it is. There is no excuse for treating the players in this fashion, Black or 
  White. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #233. November 21,2003: Hollman/Heritage. What a name. Neither 
  a home nor a job for intended African Americans as promised. </strong></p>
<p>The city has not addressed it one iota. Read the story in Chapter 8 of “The 
  Minneapolis Story.” Contracts were to be awarded to African American firms. 
  That has not been done. It is more than ironic that the oversight department 
  is the Civil Rights Department, which is doing absolutely nothing other than 
  provide false documents, false information, etc. Is it any wonder that at the 
  public meeting a couple of Thursdays ago that key players, who had said they 
  would be there decided not to show up? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #232. November 21,2003: Development for the corner of Plymouth 
  and Penn: Good news and bad news. </strong></p>
<p>The Urban League has put forth a good plan for a joint county - city credit 
  union. The plan is being blocked by the 5th Ward council member in order to 
  pave the way for a proposal by Northside Residents Redevelopment Council (NRRC) 
  that would really result in little more than a parking lot. Why this endless 
  game? NRRC picked up $668,000 a few months ago to begin land preparation on 
  the South Side of Olson Highway. Now it also wants to be the developer of the 
  property at Plymouth and Penn. How? NIRC doesn’t have those kinds of assets 
  to be double tracked like this. Unless it has a partner, which it does, Time 
  Warner. TW is serving as the underwriter for the development. TW holds the cable 
  franchise for Minneapolis. This is just another example of what I described 
  in my book of the importance of following and doing things that were campaigned 
  on. And in this instance, we have competing plans between the current and former 
  council person for the 5th ward. Small world. Doesn’t matter. They have to resolve 
  this and move forward, one way or the other. </p>

<p>NAACP past treasurer freed NAACP funds to free his investment debt. Gives new 
  meaning to the term “going to the market for some bread.” Yeah, baby, and lettuce 
  too. The demise of the Houston Supermarket Chain, like the demise of any business 
  that was the life blood of any hardworking entrepreneur, was sad to see. Silas 
  Houston was the energetic entrepreneur. We salute his for his effort. Silas 
  was also the NAACP Minneapolis branch treasurer from October 2001 to February 
  2003. According to sources, it has been confirmed that some investments placed 
  in his stores came from the Minneapolis NAACP branch investment accounts. Is 
  this why the branch cannot account for $96,000 in the investment account with 
  Pipher Japhry, as noted in the NAACP financial statements for July and August 
  2003? </p>

<p><strong>Blog #230. Thursday, November 20, 2003</strong></p>
<p>School Board tries to pin the tail on the community donkey and instead sticks 
  it in their own eye. Without commenting on the qualifications of Mr. Jennings, 
  as this is not about him, it is about the School Board, the community wonders 
  why the School Board, seeking credibility, would put Mr. Jenkins in such an 
  awkward position when they are trying to develop credibility. Isn’t the only 
  crucial point the gap in scores, the gap in the kids’ education, not the gap 
  in Mr. Jennings? One could say that with nearly 300 doctorates in the Minneapolis 
  School System, maybe its time for a non-doctorate to lead. In other words, as 
  they review candidates for Superintendent, what the new Superintendent can do 
  for the kids is more important than what he or she has done for themselves. 
  Credentialism is as bad as sexism or racism. Unless we break with the old ideas 
  that continue to not work, test scores will keep falling for African American 
  kids. Unless we break with what has been proven not to work, our kids will continue 
  to fail. Let’s not hear about process and “we haven’t done it that way before” 
  or “we’ve always done it this way.” Get our input in the community. Hear what 
  the community has to say. Then lets see some leadership, not dictatorship. Decide. 
  Act. Pin the tail on success for our kids. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #229. November 18, 2003: To Obey or Not to Obey, That is the Question. 
  NAACP Answer: not if it means we have to be accountable. </strong></p>
<p>I have heard that at the same October 18, 2003 national NAACP board meeting 
  that the national NAACP Oked the Minneapolis NAACP branch’s recommendation to 
  suspend me for speaking truth and blowing the whistle on their frauds and misappropriation 
  of funds also made the decision NOT to order the Minneapolis branch to conduct 
  an audit because of the existence of a classified report that confirms that 
  over $240,000 can’t be accounted for by the local Minneapolis branch. Is it 
  true? Just wondering. As a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization, the NAACP by constitutional 
  structure forbids its local branches from being independent 501(c)(3) entities. 
  You realize, dear reader, that this means that extra cash has to go to the national. 
  What a penny ante two way gravy train. At least Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, etc., 
  make it worth their while when they risk the perp walk. They betray us for the 
  equivalent of 30 pieces of silver. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #228. November 18, 2003: St. Paul Plays the Mirror Image Twin, 
  Faking, As Minneapolis, That They Don’t Understand What Is Going On In Terms 
  of Race. </strong></p>
<p>St Paul Police Chief Finney’s Q&amp;A in the November 9 Strib fully exposes 
  the friction between he and the Mayor (Kelly) and Vice Mayor (Flaherty). There 
  is an obvious level of racism being played out that the collective act of amnesia 
  by the Whites can’t hide. I discussed on my TV show a year ago the role these 
  guys played in knocking Finney out of the position of United States Marshall 
  for the Federal district of Minnesota two years ago. I understand playing politics 
  with a lot of positions, but doing so with Public Safety is no more desirable 
  than with brain surgery. I understand it when all things are equal but in this 
  case they decidedly were not. Too many cooks didn’t help this public safety 
  stew, especially when Jim Ramstedt and Rick Stannick the Public Safety Director, 
  along with others, stirred the pot with the race card, sinking Finney and opening 
  the door for the position for a buddy of Stannick. The good news is that Finney 
  became St. Paul Police Chief. The bad news is that the response of the good 
  ole boys was to talk of consolidating the police and sheriffs department in 
  order to block Finney from becoming the first man of color to be chief, because 
  they couldn’t get Mayor Shibel, a decent guy, to go along with their goal. It 
  is chilling to think of the extent some Whites will go to cut off their own 
  noses to spite their faces. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #227. November 17, 2003: Funds of the Freedom Fund Dinner Have 
  a History of Being Freed</strong></p>
<p>Parts are parts. Facts are facts. Evidence is evidence. But you can’t tell 
  if you can’t see, and so the local branch of the NAACP keeps the lights out 
  to keep everyone in the dark. Hey, look here, a flashlight. Let me turn it on. 
  Looky here: the financial records of the local NAACP. And what do they show? 
  That there is a history of laundering money using the Freedom Funds Dinner. 
  Hey, we get another chance to scrub clean this week. Is this why there hasn’t 
  been a financial report of the Freedom Fund Dinner since 2000? What a dinner 
  that was: $75,000 of that money is still unaccounted for. We suspect that the 
  St. Paul Companies and Wells Fargo, sponsor of that dinner, will eventually 
  be concerned regarding the lack of financial accounting. How can companies be 
  expected to sponsor and donate in the future when the past is still unknown?</p>

<p><strong>Blog #226. November 17, 2003: NAACP Steppin Fetchits us as they play 
  pedestaled lady to our black boy hat in hand gutter stand</strong></p>
<p>During the days of Jim Crow in the south, the Black man would step into the 
  gutter, off the sidewalk, when a White woman passed by, grasp his hat with both 
  hands and bow a little saying “afternoon, ma’m.” This was for protection, for 
  if his sleeve should graze her sleave, the resentful White hen fuming about 
  her White rooster visiting the Black hen house, could impose her revenge fantasy 
  on the Black man. Whites mistook this Steppin Fetchit behavior as proof of our 
  inferiority and their superiority. Instead, it was a clever ruse on our part 
  to not allow these dysfunctional White folks for taking out on us their own 
  problems. Those days are gone. We no longer have to act, hat in hand in the 
  gutter, to make it in the world today. So why did the local NAACP offer a press 
  release a couple weeks ago talking about their getting money to educate the 
  community on how to talk and respond to the police when stopped? That is one 
  of the most outrageous positions heard in a while (other than suspending those 
  speaking out against the abuses of the branch). That lead balloon won’t fly. 
  What they should be doing is seeking training not for us in how to be victims 
  but for the police on how to not victimize us and to be able to tell the difference 
  between which of us are the bad guys and which the good guys (they don’t seem 
  to have trouble distinguishing among Whites but they do with us; but of course, 
  its because we all look alike, don’t you know). Have they gone Nixonian on us? 
  Richard Nixon referred to himself as the grandfather for the nation. The NAACP 
  seems to think we are children, that the victims are the problem. The NAACP 
  is now indicating that it is the victims who are creating the problems of police 
  misconduct and police brutality, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #225. November 16, 2003: Where have all the flowers gone, where 
  have all the ideals gone, long time passing: the NAACP</strong></p>
<p>Well, its now official: I have been suspended for 5 years (earlier language 
  used was “expelled” but in the formal letter, it is “suspended”). Amazing, isn’t 
  it? A person with a high regard for the organization calls into questions directions 
  and actions that can lead to big trouble, and the NAACP buries its head in the 
  sand hoping everything will blow over. The continuing change in leadership (or, 
  better phrased, slot fillers for their is no leadership in the traditional sense 
  of that term) is creating a tremendous undercurrent of hostility that is emerging. 
  And now they are moving toward not having a general membership meeting in three 
  consecutive months, which is a gross violation of their own constitution and 
  by-laws. There have ben no financial reports either. It doesn’t take a rocket 
  scientist to connect these dots. Something is rotten and its not in Denmark. 
  So why is it that the local NAACP office can get away without filing financial 
  statements as ordered by the national office (reporting conditions were outlined 
  for the local branch on June 30, 2003, by Dirk Lawson), and yet suspend a guy 
  who accurately and appropriately points out that the local branch is leading 
  the membership as well as the organization’s good name out on a limb while reaching 
  back with a saw to cut it off. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #218. November 12, 2003: Will Minneapolis become a Mirror Image 
  of New York? Who runs New York? According to this article, its not city bosses 
  but City Unions and Non-Profits that run New York. This also relates to the 
  Minneapolis discussion of those seeking nonpartisan elections for Minneapolis. 
  </strong></p>
<p>Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been pushing for nonpartisan elections in New York, 
  according to this fascinating <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_4_who_runs_ny.html" target="_blank">City 
  Journal article </a> titled &#8220;Who Runs New York?&#8221; We are indebted to 
  another blogger for identifying this article: Regions of Mind, Friday, Nov 7, 
  2003)]. The article reports that the Mayor thinks political bosses run New York 
  and so he wants nonpartisan elections to curb their power. </p>
<p>Then the article reports that otherwise is the case, and says the answer to 
  who runs New York is: “No, Mayor Mike, it’s not political bosses. It’s city 
  unions and nonprofits.” In my book, I show that more and more, Minneapolis is 
  heading in that direction, especially in terms of education (huge gaps not closed, 
  my Chapter 7), housing (think Hollman, my Chapter 8), jobs (non-compliance by 
  city with its own hiring regulations, my Chapter 9), and public safety (unrest 
  as the price Minneapolis is willing to pay to keep the status quo, my Chapter 
  16). You decide. Key exerpts from the article follow: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> But the mayor is trying to solve the problems of 50 years ago. Stuck in 
    a time warp, he seems to think that we are still living in the days when Tammany 
    bigwigs like Carmine DeSapio or Boss Tweed chose candidates based on party 
    loyalty, without regard to merit or local support. </p>
  <p>In fact, New York City’s political system has been utterly transformed since 
    those days. Now, instead of party bosses running city hall, it is powerful 
    public-employee unions and community nonprofit groups living off government 
    money that control the city’s political process and political agenda. Yes, 
    these groups are aligned with the Democratic Party, but they are not subservient 
    to the party; the party is their instrument, a tool of their convenience. 
    Nonpartisan voting will do nothing to wrest control from these groups but 
    may instead help them solidify their political dominance at the expense of 
    the city’s taxpayers and businesses. By weakening political parties still 
    further, Mayor Bloomberg and the supporters of nonpartisan elections may inadvertently 
    destroy the only potential vehicle for true reform in a New York City whose 
    politics are increasingly under the thumb of public servants&#8230;</p>
  <p>Not long after public-sector unions became a force, another new political 
    power arose in neighborhoods: government-funded, community-based social-services 
    organizations. Spurred by Mayor John Lindsay’s efforts to decentralize government, 
    and lavishly funded with government dollars by President Lyndon Johnson’s 
    War on Poverty, activists formed organizations that built subsidized housing, 
    ran day-care centers, operated health clinics. From practically nothing in 
    the early 1960s, by 1967 there were more than 400 federal grant programs providing 
    $15 billion to these local groups around the country, with a heavy concentration 
    in New York because of the influence of Mayor Lindsay, whom Washington policymakers 
    touted as one of urban America’s new leaders. Spurred by this government largesse, 
    social-services organizations grew in New York City from a few hundred, employing 
    fewer than 50,000 people in the mid-1960s, to more than 4,000 today, employing 
    185,000 people. </p>
  <p>Over time, these groups have become a new kind of neighborhood political 
    clubhouse, running and successfully electing their own members to political 
    office. Activists like Ramon Velez, who ran a network of social-services agencies 
    out of his base in Hunts Point in the Bronx, or Pedro Espada Jr., who built 
    a single health clinic in the Soundview section of the South Bronx into a 
    sweeping public-services empire, used the influence they gained in neighborhoods 
    as a launching pad for political careers&#8230;</p>
  <p>The Democratic Party, as these recent elections make clear, is hardly the 
    all-powerful force that the mayor and other nonpartisan-election fans believe 
    it is. In fact, if there is a significant overarching force behind the city’s 
    public-sector politics today, it is the Working Families Party—which, with 
    fewer than 7,000 registered voters, is not at all a political party in the 
    conventional sense. Rather, it is a union instrument of electoral politics, 
    mobilizing the membership of its affiliated public-sector unions and union-boosting 
    activist groups like ACORN to support its preferred candidates, as in the 
    Palma-Espada race. Using New York State’s unusual election law, which allows 
    minor parties to endorse candidates from other parties, the WFP has been able 
    to work both with the Democratic leadership and at times against it to elect 
    candidates hewing to its agenda of bigger government and higher taxes. </p>
  <p>[What will happen to] the proven Giuliani urban agenda—fiscal restraint, 
    effective policing, and school choice&#8230;an alternative to the public-sector 
    domination of the city&#8230;[if the] mayor who seems to have little clue 
    about the true nature of the city’s contemporary political culture or even 
    the forces that elected him, would bury any prospects, however slim today, 
    for such crucial reform [?] </p>

<p><strong>Blog #217. November 11, 2003: VETERANS DAY 2003 </strong></p>
<p>Today, November 11, 2003, is Veterans Day. We don’t know yet whether the current 
  hostilities in Iraq qill be remembered positively as most of our past engagement 
  or negatively, as Vietnam. But we do know that for better or ill (that is the 
  current debate) a tyrant has been brought down and an enslaved people freed. 
  And although few Americans are dying compared to past engagements (Vietnam and 
  before), each lost life is still a tragedy for their family and friends and 
  for the community, where they live and for the nation as a whole. The sacrifices 
  of our soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines, coast guard and regular/reserves, 
  ensures our liberty. </p>
<p>Why November 11th? Because on November 11th, 1921, an unknown American soldier 
  from World War I was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, in recognition of 
  WWI veterans and in conjunction with the timing of cessation of hostilities 
  at 11 a.m., November 11, 1918 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month). 
  President Warren Harding requested that: &#8220;All&#8230;citizens&#8230;indulge 
  in a period of silent thanks to God for these&#8230;valorous lives and of supplication 
  for His Divine mercy&#8230;on our beloved country.&#8221; Inscribed on the Tomb 
  are the words: &#8220;Here lies in honored glory an American soldier know but 
  to God.&#8221; The day became known as &#8220;Armistice Day.&#8221; In 1954, 
  Congress, wanting to recognize the sacrifice of veterans since WWI, proposed 
  to change Armistice Day to Veterans Day in their honor. President Dwight D. 
  Eisenhower, former Supreme Commander in WWII, signed the legislation. </p>
<p>To honor those veterans who sacrificed all, an Army honor guard from the 3d 
  U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard) keeps day and night vigil at Arlington. At 11 
  a.m. today, a combined color guard representing all military service branches 
  executes &#8220;Present Arms&#8221; at the tomb for the laying of a wreath by the president. 
  This is followed by &#8220;Taps.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Defense Department has totaled one measure of the price of liberty&#8212;almost 
  1.2 million members of our fighting forces have died while in service to our 
  country since the American Revolution; 1.4 million have been wounded. The numbers, 
  of course, offer no reckoning of the inestimable value of these individual citizens&#8217; 
  lives, and the sacrifices borne by their families. But we do know their sacrifices 
  defended a precious gift handed down to us&#8212;the liberties we cherish. Every 
  day&#8212;but today especially&#8212;let us always hold our veterans and their families 
  in our hearts. </p>
<p>On this 50th anniversary of our commemoration of Veterans Day, we encourage 
  everyone to visit the official Veterans Affairs website for instruction and 
  learning aids on the history and significance of Veterans Day. Link to&#8212;http://www.appc1.va.gov/vetsday. 
  Additional information is at http://Federalist.com. </p>
<p>President John F. Kennedy, opened his innaugural address saying: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom&#8212;symbolizing 
    an end as well as a beginning&#8212;signifying renewal as well as change. For I 
    have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed 
    nearly a century and three-quarters ago. </p>
  <p>The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power 
    to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet 
    the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at 
    issue around the globe&#8212;the belief that the rights of man come not from the 
    generosity of the state but from the hand of God. </p>
  <p>We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. 
    Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that 
    the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans&#8212;born in this century, 
    tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient 
    heritage&#8212;and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human 
    rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are 
    committed today at home and around the world. </p>
  <p>Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay 
    any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose 
    any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then closed his innaugural saying: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted 
    the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink 
    from this responsibility&#8212;I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would 
    exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, 
    the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country 
    and all who serve it&#8212;and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  </p>
  <p>And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you&#8212;ask 
    what you can do for your country. </p>
  <p>My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but 
    what together we can do for the freedom of man. </p>
  <p>Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask 
    of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask 
    of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final 
    judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing 
    and His help, but knowing that here on earth God&#8217;s work must truly be our 
    own. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is our debate today. How it plays out we will know soon enough. But as 
  a descend of slaves, don’t ask me to be sad that the Iraqi people have been 
  freed. As a descendent of Native Americans, don’t ask me to be sad that the 
  Kurds have been free. From bloggers in Iraq we read the equivalent of Brother 
  Kings’ “Free at last, free at last” (although they invoke God as Allah), and 
  bloggers in Iran are saying come free us too. So lets remember our Kennedy Democrat 
  defense of freedom for all people. But lets not forget our own people. $87 billion 
  for Iraq ($22 for rebuilding and the rest for the military) is one thing. Not 
  a cent for our inner cities is another. Let us not be standing at the plate 
  swinging from the left side or the right side. Let us stand at the plate as 
  switch hitters, as ambidexterous, as brining freedom to Iraq and our inner cities. 
  We still have troops in Germany and Japan. The cold war is over. Lets spend 
  that money on our inner cities. I wait for a national party in this country 
  to lead the way to end the corruption in our cities and to set our inner city 
  ghettos free </p>
<p>That will be part of the prize we seek. We won’t let the deferment of our dream 
  stop us for honoring those who have given their lives for our right to have 
  our debates. Where else in the world could we have such hatred on both sides 
  and not get clamped down on by the government. Only in America. But the hatred 
  must stop, from both sides. We still need to come together, to reconcile enough 
  to find our common ground (see my <a href="../../solutionpapers/18ubuntu.htm">&#8221;Ubuntu&#8221; 
  Reconciliation </a> piece) and work on the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> areas together. </p>
<p>In my book, “The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,” I acknowledge the proud 
  history of Blacks serving in the armed forces and the manner in which they stood 
  up to protect their communities in this country against Jim Crow, the KKK, and 
  the terrible manner of second class citizens, barred from both education and 
  voting. We have come a long way (see Interludes 5 and 7 of my book) but a glass 
  half full is still half empty. We have a long way to go (see Interludes 2 &amp; 
  10). Many don’t realize that many of the soldiers during the post Civil War 
  era in the West were African Americans (Buffalo Soldiers), contrary to the Hollywood 
  version of all White (for all their posturing about their liberal sensibilities, 
  Hollywood still does not accord African Americans their proper due in their 
  positive roles in the defining events of the history of this country. The Tuskegee 
  Airman were one of the most elite group of fliers in World II. We earned more 
  than our fair share of citations for bravery in World War II, Korean, Vietnam, 
  the Gulf War, etc. They said Blacks couldn’t be quarterbacks because they were 
  too dumb. Indeed, in World War II they didn’t let many be front line soldiers 
  for that reason too. Then those that were allowed acquitted themselves with 
  such distinction, that we were allowed to lead in the fighting as well </p>
<p>Hollywood movies may call it Technicolor, and their stars may stand at the 
  microphones and shout their support for people of color, but when it comes to 
  their movies and TV shows, we are relegated to sports and music. For them, we 
  are neither in Technicolor or black and white. Their color, regardless of whether 
  you are talking behind the camera or in front of it, is White wash (of course 
  when our people made “Barber Shop” our professional movement entertainers, our 
  rush to the cameral to complainers, would have shut us down there too, and it 
  was almost all Black before and behind the camera). They could influence the 
  business. They refuse. Just as much of the building of this nation was done 
  by slaves and their descendents to this day, so too has this nation been defended 
  by the descendents of slaves, from the Civil War on down to Iraq today. Let’s 
  keep arguing on how best to achieve peace and freedom around the globe, but 
  let us never forget the contributions of our Black soldiers or any other, and 
  lets not let their sacrifice be in vain. </p>
<p>Let us continue to live our lives such that the sacrifices made my our men 
  and women in uniform continues to give us freedom and liberty so we can continue 
  to debate whether we want our freedom and liberty. Now that’s a free country.</p>

<p><strong>Blog #216. November 10, 2003: Expectations determine much, from losers 
  in educational results to losers in football games</strong></p>
<p>Both the 1968 Kerner Commission Report and the 1998 Bell Curve state Blacks 
  can’t make it like others. The most recent local NAACP President to resign said 
  the problems in the Black community would take generations to fix. These are 
  LOW expectations. Martin Luther King, Jr., in “Why We Can’t Wait” and in his 
  we may be unqualified today but we are qualifyable, spoke the language of HIGH 
  expectations. </p>
<p>In our schools, I call it (Chapter 7 of my book: Stop the clubbing and teach 
  skills, optimism and hope) clubbing the kids, which is another way of saying 
  LOW expectations. Sharon Begley, in her recent “Science Journal” column, says 
  that “Seventy-six years on, scientists have documented the power of expectations, 
  not only of lab researchers but also of teachers, athletic coaches, judges and 
  work supervisors.” Here are the money quotes (emphasis added): </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Expectation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,&#8221; says Robert Rosenthal, professor 
    of psychology at the University of California, Riverside (See his <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/servlet/useragent?func=callWizard&amp;wizardKey=salesAgent:1068525163591&amp;action=show&quot;" target="_blank">Covert 
    communication in laboratories, classrooms and the truly real world 
    </a> in &#8220;Current Directions in Psychological Science,&#8221; Oct. 2003, p. 151. 
    His &#8220;Covert Communication in Classrooms, Clinics, Courtrooms, and Cubicles&#8221; 
    from American Psychologist, Nov. 2002, p. 839, has many references). &#8220;When 
    teachers have been led to expect better intellectual performance from their 
    students, they tend to get it. When coaches are led to expect better athletic 
    performance from their athletes, they tend to get it. When behavioral researchers 
    are led to expect a certain response from their research subjects, they tend 
    to get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expectation effects, also known as the Pygmalion effect, have been documented 
  time and again (479 studies have found that teachers&#8217; expectations affect how 
  students do, for instance). But nailing down exactly how expectations are conveyed 
  to students, athletes or research volunteers through the nonverbal, subtle and 
  usually unintentional messages that Prof. Rosenthal calls &#8220;covert communication&#8221; 
  has been much tougher. </p>
<p>More alarming is how little-known the expectation effect is. And that means 
  there is a good possibility that some of the effects we attribute to a particular 
  cause&#8212;from the benefits of smaller class sizes to the health-improving 
  effects of wealth&#8212;actually reflect the power of expectations. </p>
<p>The power of expectations in the classroom is downright scary. &#8220;The only difference 
  was in the mind, and expectations, of the teacher,&#8221; says Prof. Rosenthal. Yet 
  those expectations produced clear academic differences. </p>
<p>All sorts of things are reported to boost student achievement, from using a 
  varied vocabulary with little kids to keeping class size small. But if teachers 
  or parents expect these things to make kids smarter, might the improvement actually 
  reflect those expectations? </p>
<p>This is huge in terms of education and what is written in the book and should 
  be very helpful in the inner city working with kids as it bolsters our argument 
  in the book and the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece. </p>
<p>So if the Gallmans/NAACP of the world say it will take generations, and that 
  expectation is conveyed from the pulpits and in the homes and in the schools 
  and in the neighborhoods, is it any wonder why it is so easy to club the cubs 
  in school. We need the pulpits and homes and schools and neighborhoods to trumpet 
  HIGH expectations, not low. </p>
<p>This also helps to explain expectation in both the classroom and on the sports 
  field. White coaches with tinges of either racism or “bell curve liberalism/conservatism” 
  won’t have the expectations and thus low results are produced by students and 
  players. </p>
<p>It makes you wonder how much Red’s harangue expressing low expectations effected 
  the play of Vikings turning that into two more losses. They just gave you what 
  you expect. Expect less, get less. Expect more, get more. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #215. November 6-8, 2003: Education is still the key, the foundation, 
  the base. </strong></p>
<p>It starts in elementary school, not HS or college. We need to ponder education 
  long and hard for jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, governing, 
  and a sense of ethics all begin with education, with the most important years 
  being the pre-school through elementary school years, the base for middle school 
  high school, trade schools and colleges, and life beyond. It all begins with 
  education. </p>
<p>Regardless of what your read, my book or my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece or my <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action </a> piece or my Unfinished Dream piece, the solution 
  still goes to, begins and ends with education. Education is also the solution 
  to what I write about in my State of Emergency for Black Youth And by education 
  I don’t mean “re-education” or sensitivity training or any other feel good or 
  “re-orientation” curriculum. </p>
<p>As Nellie Johnson so profoundly repeated, No education, no jobs, no housing. 
  In oher words, without a good education preparing one for a good job there would 
  not be the income to afford good housing. She also phrase it No education, no 
  jobs, no hope,” meaning that without a good education to enable a good job, 
  there would be no hope. We have delivered no hope to our cubs in our schools, 
  and instead have clubbed them, and then forced them into containment neighborhoods. 
  This is the recipe for a forced false class-based society and a very real class-based 
  social struggle. We can stop that with equal access and equal opportunity for 
  equal education for all. </p>
<p>I maintain that it is our community’s (i.e., city’s) responsibility to guarantee 
  that financial barriers do not prevent any able, qualified young person from 
  receiving higher education. But that lofty sentiment starts at the wrong end: 
  money for college. President Truman’s Commission on Higher Education stated 
  in 1947 stated that a failure to meet this obligation threatens “the creation 
  and perpetuation of a class society which has no place in the American way of 
  life.” We immigrate many college educated people from other countries because 
  we purposefully kill the process preventing our own from getting to college. 
  Doing the math is easy: diminishing affordability imperils access to higher 
  education for children of low-income families AND all income families whose 
  kids receive a poor education. Again, it ALL starts with elementary education 
  and too many still assume we have a great K-12 system, which we don’t. </p>
<p>College is unattainable if elementary school was made unattainable even while 
  sitting in class, etc., and then continuing that through middle school and high 
  school (where at the extreme end kids get high school diplomas they can’t read). 
  Poor schools = poor outcomes due to poor teachers, poor methodology, poor resources 
  and poor support. As Sandra Scarr says: “Opportunity breeds predestination,” 
  and opportunity starts with education, and education starts with “Head Start” 
  and elementary education. This is why, in Chapter 7 of my book, I say we must 
  stop clubbing our cubs into inferiority and helplessness and teach them skills, 
  optimism, and hope. And the learning they must do to gain and use skills, sustain 
  optimism, and have hope, is to be solid in their grounding of reading, writing, 
  and ‘rithmetic. Only a school system and a superintendent committed to this 
  will give us schools that don’t leave our kids behind. My suggestions in Chapter 
  7 and in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> piece still hold. The school system and any superintendent 
  owes us a response to what I have just written in this paragraph, as do any 
  who claim to offer either leadership or spokemanship for the community, Black 
  or White. </p>
<p>We need to be clear that it’s all about schoolchildren who need their elders 
  to upgrade their early education, reduce their class sizes, better train their 
  teachers, and facilitate higher education. That’s easily as good as mother, 
  country, and apple pie. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #214. November 5, 2003: Has the Mayor and the Minneapolis Police 
  Department Transformed Minneapolis into Los Angeles and Rodney King? </strong></p>
<p>On the 10 o’clock news of October 29, 2003, KSTP showed the video tape of the 
  police beating of Alfred Flowers. But unlike Rodney King, who was guilty and 
  who was resisting arrest, our Alfred Flowers was not guilty and was not resisting 
  arrest. Indeed he was struck from behind while talking on his cell phone. Were 
  the police angry that they were found to have falsely arrested Alfred Flowers 
  several weeks earlier for obstructing justice with force and because they were 
  found to have falsely charged his sister with obstructing justice without force 
  at the NAACP meeting? Normally, when there is a video tape, the police use it 
  in writing their reports and if there is conduct on it they don’t want known, 
  they drop the charges regarding whatever it is that the tape was about. Not 
  this time. </p>
<p>This beating of Alfred Flowers, for me, Ron Edwards, is chilling for three 
  reasons. First, for seeing the ease with which, given the background of recent 
  events and the on-going federal mediation, the police still felt comfortable 
  beating up one of our people who was a member of the mediation team. Secondly, 
  they anticipated that I would be with Flowers and thus had hoped to beat me 
  up as well. And thirdly, it was chilling because it was plain to see that the 
  age old game is alive and well in Minneapolis: the game that it doesn’t make 
  any difference what the Black folks say, even if two of the witnesses include 
  a State Representative and a City Council Member, we’re still going to beat 
  the crap out of them and, despite the tape or its possibility, web will still 
  charge the Black man. This is Minneapolis’ Plantation style White jury mentality: 
  it doesn’t make any difference what the White man does, the Black man is guilty.</p>
<p>The Chief would not go along with it after seeing the tape and the report by 
  the Internal Affairs Division, which had subpoenaed the tape a month ago. The 
  Chief advised the City Attorney it would be a bad move to go after Alfred Flowers. 
  The charge was then dismissed. The Head of the Police Federation and Mayor Rybak, 
  along with the inspector or commander at the 4th precinct, fooled around and 
  got a policeman who had had a conversation with Alfred&#8217;s sister on the Monday 
  they came to pick up the tape, took her words and twisted them, and made it 
  appear that she confirmed that she and her brother were out of control, and 
  used that to recharge the case, tocharge her, and to move his case to the County 
  Attorney’s office. </p>
<p>When the Chief and the Internal Affairs Department got the tape under subpoena, 
  they didn’t show it to the other police who wrote their reports of the incident. 
  The tape clearly shows the lies those cops told. When they recharged Flowers 
  they opened themselves up to exposing the reality of the lies of the police 
  report compared to the actual events as caught on video tape. </p>
<p>All of this took place while Al Gallman was still President of the NAACP and 
  the Mayor’s boy. They had anticipated that yours truly, Ron Edwards, was going 
  to be with Flowers, and by beating us both up we’d end mediation. They mayor 
  is obsessed with ending the mediation. Last week at the meeting of the near 
  North Side the Mayor took a “whipping” from over 300 people. They haven’t been 
  right since. In the meantime, the head of the Federation, John D’Monico is upset 
  and told the KSTP reporter two weeks ago that Flowers would be charged, not 
  knowing that the charge had been dismissed. When the reporter told him the charge 
  had been dismissed D’Monico went berserk. Detective Ryan developed a nonsense, 
  fallacious twisting of the facts and presented them to Amy Klobachar in the 
  County Attorney’s office. But the County Attorney’s office didn&#8217;t know the history 
  of the tape. They assumed that the cops had seen the tape and had done their 
  reports accordingly. They didn’t realize until the KSTP report on TV that the 
  cops had not seen the tape. </p>
<p>The tape shows how Abercrombie, who works for the Urban League (which was in 
  on this), made two telephone calls to the police on 911 at 9:29 am and 9:46 
  am, saying Flowers was violent. KSTP-TV shows Flowers in the interior of the 
  Urban League building doing nothing of any violent nature. The cops indicated 
  that when they confronted Flowers on the street corner that Flowers took a fighting 
  stance and began to flail at the officers. But the film shown on KSTP shows 
  this: Flowers standing on the corner talking on his cell phone when the squad 
  car pulls us. Flowers walks over to the car, bends down, nods in obvious conversation, 
  and then turns and walks away. The cop exists the car and puts a leg whip to 
  Flowers from behind and a blow to the head, knocking him to the ground. Four 
  other officers who had also arrived at the same time jumped on Flowers too and 
  they just stomped on him and beat the crap out of him. </p>
<p>When it was made known that Flowers was going to be charged, the Mayor and 
  his group were hoping that would break up the mediation group and we would break 
  off negotiations. Nope. Not going to do it. </p>
<p>Besides the obvious unanswered questions, here is another: where is Abercrombie, 
  the Urban League property manager for the Urban League? All of a sudden, he 
  is not in town. </p>
<p>Note the arrogance and confidence of these particular police officers that 
  they can act this way, knowing there was evidence out there such as the tapes 
  911 keeps of all calls and the video. Another question: how deep does the personal 
  role of the Mayor go? The Chief told the KSTP reporter that he held the Mayor 
  responsible for the attack on Flowers as an attempt to get us to end mediation. 
  Another question is how many time the local TV stations and Star Tribune have 
  let episodes of this go unreported in the general atmosphere of “containment” 
  that only a video tape enabled the right thing to be done? Another question: 
  how often do the cops manhandle unnecessarily that fear prevents reporting by 
  the victims? The tape shows the cops choking and strangling Alfred Flowers as 
  they are putting him in the car as tried to pretend that he was resisting when 
  you can see that, from the strangling and choke holds, he was almost unconscious. 
  And yet in their reports they write that he tried to fight them and continued 
  to resist as they put him in their squad car. There are ways to deal with situations 
  like this. I have presented themm in my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper. This incident is just another example of our Unfinished 
  Dream, and why we call for <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="03212b1103"></a>Blog #213. November 3, 2003: Doug Grow covers half the stomping, missing 
  the more interesting half: that just as some of the stomping of citizens by 
  police is illegal, some of the stomping done by City Hall is illegal yet intentional, 
  lawless yet purposeful, against its own laws that are ignored and against Federal 
  laws which the feds won’t long ignore. </strong></p>
<p>Doug Grow’s recent column <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/465/4183019.html" target="_blank">City 
  Hall Stomps on Man’s Dream </a> , should have been entitled “City Hall 
  Screws Lawful Citizen Due to Unlawful Acts of City Council.” This story illustrates 
  several points we keep trying to make that Grow and the Strib continue to ignore. 
  But first, let’s recap the story: the man involved, Iraqi by birth, an American 
  citizen as of 2000, had the rug pulled out from under him by City Hall. As Grow 
  reports, “He went to the zoning office and got clearance to operate a store 
  at 3453 Penn Avenue, North. He signed a lease with the owner of the building. 
  He hired an architect accustomed to working with city officials, to develop 
  a plan on how the building and land around it should be designed. He received 
  a building permit from the city in May 2002, to do substantial remodeling of 
  the property. He began work immediately, investing thousands of dollars in the 
  building.” </p>
<p>Then he was told, after being granted the permit, after expending the money, 
  that the City Council had voted on a moratorium on convenience stores because 
  they were magnets for bad elements. As Grow continues, “These moratoriums can 
  be a damning mystery. They are to be enforced at the moment they are passed 
  by the council, meaning they’re enforceable before anyone else in the public 
  or government knows they exist.” The Ward involved in this story was “that of 
  [CM Barb] Johnson [who] refused to bend&#8230;” and plead his case before the 
  City Council, even though the neighborhood association backed the request for 
  a waiver for the store. Then Johnson says, “I don’t know how that administrative 
  process works.” This is reminiscent of the crime lord who tells his henchmen 
  “to take care of it” but don’t tell me how you did it. The lesson, she said, 
  was not to invest in someone else’s building. </p>
<p>How is this attitude going to attract investors and create jobs in Minneapolis? 
  You would think fairness would allow for grandfathering starts but apparently 
  fairness is not an issues. No is there recourse to get his money back. No matter 
  how the city spins it, this was a taking of the man’s wealth (see my Interlude 
  8, “Torn from the land,” about how governments, federal/state/local (but mostly 
  local) have legally taken the wealth of minorities (especially from the descendents 
  of America’s slaves). </p>
<p>The moratorium is because of the city’s claim that it blames convenience stores 
  for being magnets of the “bad” elements. But the villain isn’t the convenience 
  store. The villain is the city, because the city has purposefully created neighborhoods 
  impacted as concentrations of poverty and crime as part of the city’s intentional 
  pattern of segregation and discrimination by creating “containment zones” to 
  “contain” poverty and crime so they will not go to the suburban White neighborhoods. 
  Doug should be writing about that. </p>
<p>These neighborhoods become dumping grounds for the kids the city won’t educate 
  (Chapter 7), a dead end for young men the city won’t facilitate jobs for, especially 
  by purposely staying out of the compliance that would create them (Chapter 9), 
  and a place where the poor are condemned to lousy housing (Chapter 8). Doug 
  should be writing about that. These city crimes are committed in broad daylight: 
  even though they are in violation not only of Federal law but the city’s own 
  laws to not have such “supported housing” concentrations. Doug should be writing 
  about that. So the magnet was created by and is sustained by the City. Doug 
  should be writing about that. </p>
<p>This is not the blue collar crime of the street criminals (though it incubates 
  it) nor the White color crime of the developers and the city agencies working 
  in cahoots with developers (although it incubates it). It is more elevated. 
  It is another “step up”: in abstraction. It is easier to get away with. It is 
  “black collar” crime as in the black collars on the robes warn by judges in 
  court: thus either making it legal (anything can be made legal: slavery and 
  voting being but two examples) and acceptable (where everyone turns their head 
  in a “this is the way we’ve always done business” look, as in all of the civil 
  rights laws that are ignored that I document in my book), and thus we have a 
  new “class” of offense to add to “blue” collar and “white” collar crimes of 
  individuals: the “black” collar of the law. It is institutionalized crime by 
  the city. Doug should be writing about that. These black collar crimes get largely 
  ignored. Doug should be writing about that. </p>
<p>And who pays for the lawlessness of this? The taxpayer pays in money, the small 
  entrepreneur or businessman pays with his or her business and the poor and uneducated 
  pay with their present and future standard of living and quality of life. Doug 
  should be writing about that. It is these establishment policies that stomp 
  on citizens, regardless of whether the enabling policy is legal or illegal, 
  that Doug needs to address. Unique and isolated incidents are the consequences 
  of the larger institutionalized lawlessness of the city, especially when it 
  comes to development. This is what Doug should be writing about. </p>
<p>Doug also misses how he is part of those described in my recent Solution Paper, <a href="../../solutionpapers/20restore.htm">Restorative 
  Affirmative Action, </a> as he often writes as a bell curve liberal 
  (those folks who believe the descendants of the American slave are too dumb 
  to make it on their own and therefore they dote on immigrants Blacks who are 
  not descended from America’s slaves, on other immigrant groups, and on other 
  real and self-described victim groups, etc.). This is part of the reason why 
  the Strib ignores the communities of the descendents of America&#8217;s slaves. </p>
<p>Thus, we ask again: where are Doug’s stories of this kind of treatment of the 
  Iraqi that has been meted out to the sons and daughters of the American slave, 
  who have also attempted to be store owners? He once again celebrates those allowed 
  to jump to the head of the line ahead of the sons and daughters of America’s 
  slaves because the Middle Easterner is viewed as being more capable and more 
  worthy. We are not encouraged and when we try we are expected to fail. Doug 
  should be writing about that. But there is hope: my <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper. Doug and the Strib should be writing about that 
  too. <br />

<p><strong><a name="03212b1103"></a>Blog #212. November 3, 2003: Life and death games by the Strib: Stopping 
  doesn’t mean a ticket to stomp</strong></p>
<p>Some have asked what was meant in my column about the Strib issuing death warrants. 
  Readers of this Blog know that I have taken on the Strib for lacking in journalistic 
  integrity and for practicing selective and negative journalism. Now, please 
  understand, no one defends criminals for doing criminal deeds nor does anyone 
  like to be forced into a sitation where it looks like they are defending criminals. 
  Criminal behavior is a menace to public safety, White or Black. On the other 
  hand, how we handle criminals says a lot about our character as a city and how 
  we treat different segments of citizens. In the most recent cases of young Blacks 
  being, or allegedly being sodomized by the police, and then reporting that in 
  the one case one is a police informant, without any proof, is to sign his death 
  warrant when he goes back to his hood and fellow criminals not wanting him to 
  snitch. Both, therefore, need to be in protective custody because of the collusion 
  of the Strib and the police to try them and convict them in the court of public 
  opinion (in the process the Strib breaks the cover of an informant, rendering 
  him useless in the future). Protective custody would be consistent with procedures 
  in such cases, as bad a taste as that leaves in all of our mouths. Do we say 
  this to protect criminals? No, we say it to protect everyone. We need police. 
  There are bad people out there. But too often Blacks are wrongfully stomped 
  after being stopped, including innocent 14 year olds like Matt Little’s grandson. 
  Stopping is one thing. Stomping is another. if they can flagrantly label those 
  held innocent until proven guilty as guilty until proven innocent, and stomp 
  on them as they please, it is a small step to do so to those they just don’t 
  like for political reasons, as seems to be the case in the stomping of Alfred 
  Flowers, resulting in his being hospitalized. There is no room in our society 
  for lawbreakers nor for law enforcement personnel who would respond to lawbreakers 
  with lawbreaking of their own. We all know where vigilantism leads. Certainly 
  the anger of the Strib, especially over Jennings, is understandable. What is 
  not understandable, nor excusable, is their stooping to journalistic terrorism 
  in response. </p>

<p><strong>Blog #211. November 2, 2003: Red Going Berserk in the Locker Room: 
  Preparation for a New Stadium Fight or the Move Out of Town? </strong></p>
<p>We wish our Minnesota Vikings well in their game today. But we are still wondering 
  what was up with Red McCombs after last week’s game when he said to his team 
  that had become one of the last unbeatens to lose a game, to go 6-1, that they 
  “humiliated” him and the organization for losing their first game. What’s up 
  with Red? And why did he say Monday he doesn’t remember saying it but that if 
  he did he apologizes and then repeats he doesn’t remember saying it? Was this 
  a public relations disasters or strategic act to build anger at him and the 
  team to make it easer to skip out of town so that the reality won’t hit until 
  after they are gone (see Chapter 15 of my book), or both. So how are to take 
  his following day statement that it was a misunderstanding when he also says 
  “if” he said it, saying he can’t remember having done so? It’s going to be hard 
  to move a successful team. Is this part of a strategy to get into the heads 
  of the team so they lose and prick the balloon of the fans and their love of 
  their team so while they are disappointed they don’t raise a finger as the team 
  is moved out of town, out of state? Red seems to be doing everything he can 
  to agitate and provoke. Is that what asking South Dakota for $500,000 to have 
  the training camp in that state is all about? Or is this the response of a bottle? 
  Or dementia? Or old age? </p>
