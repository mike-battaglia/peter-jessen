<p><strong>18 Models </strong><strong>For Conflict Resolution</strong></p>
<p>By Peter J. Jessen<br>
  1998-2000; last edited 7-18-01 and 9-27-03</p>
<p>(Copy sent to MN legislature, House Speaker, Steve 
  Sviggum and Senate President Roger Moe and others: Roy Terwilliger, Larry Fitzgerald, 
  John Marty, David Jennings, Otis Courtney, Sarah Psick, Victor Moore, Tom Hanson) 
</p>
<p>In 1998, the set consisted of 5 macro models. In 2000, an additional set of 
  5 was added, of micro models. In August of 2001, the documents included 7 each 
  micro and macro for 14 models. In early September 2001 one more macro and one 
  more micro model was added. Both model 9&#8217;s added 9-27-03 All of these models 
  have been rendered all the more relevant in light of 9/11/01.  <br>
   <br>
  The original set of models was applied to the June 2000 Columbine P.S. paper 
  on education, also on this web site.  Those original 10 models are the same.  
  What is changed is the addition of four more models each for macro and micro 
  situations.<br>
   <br>
  As before, the models are for use in conflict resolution, to enable the establishing 
  of dialogue between all stakeholders by enabling them to conduct their own dialogue 
  marathon:  9 at the macro-societal and institutional level, and 9 at the micro-individual 
  level for use in face-to-face encounters, whether the other individual(s) does 
  or does no represent a larger institution of society.  These models can be used 
  to avoid what is often a disastrous swing of the pendulum, in order to enable 
  all involved to use what is described below as a "calculus of meaning" and a 
  "calculus of pain" to assist in their deliberations.  <br>

  Regarding the 18 models of conflict resolution<br>
   <br>
  This continues my quest to both understand conflicts and to develop workable 
  resolutions for such conflicts, whether personal (micro) or between larger aggregations 
  of individuals in the institutions and nations of society and the world (macro).  
  I began the list with a total of 5 macro in 1997, with the micro being added 
  in 1999.  As new ones are learned of, they are added.  <br>
   <br>
  Peter Berger has coined, among many highly useful terms, this pair: &#8220;historically 
  specific conservatives&#8221; (those of the left or right who would usher in their 
  desired type of society and then freeze it in place) and "historically nonspecific 
  conservatives&#8221; (those who accept change and make haste slowly).  I find them 
  so much more useful as a way of looking at the ideological landscape (as it 
  cannot be avoided).  As I also state on those pages, this and another pair of 
  Berger's analytical word tools,&#8221;calculus of meaning&#8221; and &#8220;calculus of pain&#8221;, 
  are, in my judgment, the critical one- two punch of analysis and conflict resolution.  
  They are two of the four key organizing principles for dealing with such conflict 
  resolution, along with the concepts of &#8220;lists/recipes&#8221; and collaboration.  &#8220;Recipes&#8221; 
  comes from Berger as well, through Alfred Schutz.  All of which I would make 
  a part of what Cassidy call "the politics of love," which has to be both the 
  umbrella over and foundation under all discussions and interactions if true 
  conflict resolution is to be achieved in a way that love and justice pervades 
  and is received and perceived by both sides.  These models are of particular 
  importance and relevance in the continuing conflicts in the world today, whether 
  by nation-states or independent groups dedicated to changing society through 
  violence.</p>
<p><strong> <a name="macro"></a>THE 9 MACRO MODELS</strong></p>
<p><strong>FIRST<a name="FIRST"></a>:  Masada</strong>, a &#8220;how NOT to work things 
  out. It is a story set in Palestine/Israel of 72 A.D.  It is a story of the 
  failure to attempt or trust mediation (although it is not known if any was attempted).  
  The Zealots, on top of the 1300 foot plateau, were unable to prevent the Romans&#8217; 
  slow, methodical, progress of building a ramp to the top of the sheer cliff 
  in order to breach their defenses (FN#13).  It is a lesson in both international 
  and local politics and an opportunity to understand our own behavior better.  &#8220;Masada&#8221; was a four part ABC Novel for Television, April 5-8, 1981.  Having 
  people watch the video tape would be an excellent dynamic.  CIS (Cultural Information 
  Service), in NYC, wrote a marvelous study guide for it, that stands alone as 
  a guide to any discussion regarding conflict resolution, peace, etc., as well.  
  It is 15 pages, with pictures, on 11x14 paper (FN#14)<br>
   <br>
  <strong>SECOND<a name="SECOND"></a>:  &#8220;The Evangelical Academies&#8221; </strong>model 
  of post World War II West Germany, where the mediator is the faith community, 
  discussed in the book Confession, Conflict & Community.  They were established 
  by the faith community.  In a word, unlike Humpty Dumpty and all the king&#8217;s 
  men, they  were able to help put West Germany back together again, as &#8220;the academies 
  played a singular role in restoring the democratic idea after the disaster of 
  the Third Reich.&#8221;  &#8220;The Evangelical Academies&#8221; have been in continuous use, 
  and were central to the recreation of West Germany.  These &#8220;academies&#8221; provided 
  a sense of dialogue between all the parties, fostering and enabling a kind of &#8220;mediating action&#8221; to take place between the social and political forces (not 
  as in arbitration or in seeking compromise, but rather in the sense of creating 
  a &#8220;zone of freedom&#8221; in which the concerns of all sides could be brought to bear 
  upon the urgent issues before them, using a set general process agendas in which 
  the specifics could be discussed and dealt with by all concerned.  The meetings 
  were held outside the cities in the country side, with minimal distractions, 
  and always with a mixed group of stakeholders.  The first conference brought 
  together &#8220;150 lawyers and economists&#8221; and later ones &#8220;laborers, farmers, physicians, 
  and social service workers&#8212;people from all walks of life.&#8221;  A key lesson learned 
  was the importance and &#8220;necessity for each occupational group within the framework 
  of modern society to encounter the group that it most complained about.&#8221;  (FN#6)</p>
<p>The academies continued through the decades, with problems addressed ranging 
  from road locations to international issues of concern.  19 Academies continue 
  today under an umbrella association, and is working with similar movements in 
  Africa, Asia and America.  They were also used in East Germany to give citizens 
  a place to gather and discuss prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall (prior to 
  which over 1,500 conferences were held each year), and then used later to help 
  in the reunification of West Germany and East Germany after the fall of the 
  Berlin Wall. (FN#7)  Why not regarding education in America?</p>
<p><strong>THIRD<a name="THIRD"></a>:  the mediation model</strong> used in South Africa.  
  The model is outlined as a theoretical piece as well as being discussed in the 
  practical terms of its actual use in this setting.  The 1989 book The Passing 
  Summer : A South African&#8217;s Response to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics 
  of Love, by Michael Cassidy, discusses the situational complex of apartheid 
  in the summer of 1986, including the several centuries of actions that led to 
  apartheid.  The actual South Africa mediation model is outlined in the 1988 
  book A Future South Africa:  Visions, Strategies, and Realities, edited by Peter 
  L. Berger and Bobby Godsell. On page 320-321 of the Berger-Godsell book is the &#8220;Analytic Scheme&#8221; for guiding the research and, on pp. 322-323, is Peter Berger&#8217;s 
  outline for &#8220;reality-testing&#8221; what is being done.  The change in South Africa, 
  as anywhere else, did not &#8220;just&#8221; happen.  The Berger-Godsell report was released 
  in 1988, two years before Nelson Mandella was released from prison, who was 
  then elected President in 1994.  After 1988 and 1989, the contents of these 
  two books merged in the conferences that were held to discuss the transition 
  out of apartheid.</p>
<p>In an update received from Bobby Godsell in March 2000, he discusses four additional 
  conferences which were particularly helpful, conferences which bear witness 
  to how well this model can be used successfully all along the spectrum of stakeholder 
  positions.  The four conferences were:  (1) 1989, called by the then new Afrikaner 
  Nationalist president, FW de Klerk to address the problems of political violence 
  (which the African National Conference boycotted); (2) 1994:  called by a Kenyan 
  Bishop which resulted in involving the Inkatha Movement, led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
  just weeks before the first democratic election in 1994, enabling it to join 
  the now cooperating ANC and de Klerk government; (3-4) the use of the &#8220;reality 
  testing&#8221; model of the referenced 1988 book by groups on the far right and left:   
  by the Broederbond, a secret Afrikaner Nationalist intellectual organization, 
  led during this critical period by J P de Lange, and by the South African Communist 
  Party.  Of these latter two, Bobby Godsell states, &#8220;In both cases they concluded 
  that [their old] strategies were not possible,&#8221; and thus they too joined to 
  work cooperatively with the other stakeholders regarding South Africa&#8217;s development&#8221; 
  (FN#11).  And such mediation continues.  Godsell also reports (FN#9) that &#8220;Evangelical 
  Christianity continues to play a surprising role in providing a common road 
  to modernity for black and white, left and right&#8221;   (FN#10).  It is the &#8220;common 
  road,&#8221; properly given a &#8220;realty testing,&#8221; which provides its users with a peaceful 
  outcome as well as opportunity to move toward a more just one. Perhaps the title 
  of Michael Cassidy&#8217;s book shows us why it worked in South Africa and why it 
  can work in education in the United States:  The Passing Summer : A South African&#8217;s 
  Response to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love.  Fear and anger 
  clouded both the presentation of issues and judgment about them.  Love, in the 
  form of the Golden Rule, was used.  Love, however defined, whether in terms 
  of civility of discourse, civility in relational interaction, or both, can enable 
  the Archimedian lever of mediation to enable the resolution of the problems 
  to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>FOURTH<a name="FOURTH"></a>:  The Oslo Accords Process</strong> being used in 
  the Middle East to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
  was begun in the woods of Norway.  See The New Yorker article, Annals of Diplomacy 
  section (Dec. 20, 1993, pp. 77-85):  &#8220;THE PEACEMAKERS&#8221;.  Subhead:  &#8220;In Norway, 
  two Israeli academics [the initial mediators] worked for months to broker the 
  secret peace&#8212;and succeeded where governments had failed.&#8221;  The initial success 
  of what is being called &#8220;The Oslo Accords&#8221; has come about because both sides 
  agreed to leave the most contentious issues until last (West bank, the final 
  settlement of Jerusalem, and full sovereignty passed to the Palestinian Authority, 
  or &#8220;PA&#8221;, among others of the most thorniest issues), so as to work on the areas 
  on which there either was agreement or clear room for negotiation.  The theory:  
  that the process of working together would enable both sides to become familiar 
  with each other, break down the walls between them, and develop a kind of trust 
  that would enable them, after resolving the &#8220;are negotiable&#8221; issues to finally 
  tackle the major issues separating both sides, issues which were originally 
  labeled &#8220;non-negotiable.&#8221;  Theory problem:   unlike with West Germany and South 
  Africa, a common faith bond between the two sides is missing.  Rather than gradually 
  reconciling with each other (made possible by the use of love, the basis of 
  any faith community context), the process has been one sided, without reconciliation 
  because of the continued propaganda of hate and fanatic Islamism, which has 
  been the staple of the Palestinian culture since the creation of the Jewish 
  state in 1948, and the demand from certain Israeli elements of a restoration 
  of Israel as in Biblical times.   The irony is that the Masada roles are now 
  reversed.  The Palestinian Authority is acting the role of Rome wanting the 
  Israeli&#8217;s to act the role of the 1st century Zealots and kill themselves.  In 
  its current state, this model is actually moving toward the Palestinian goal 
  of a Masada-like conclusion. </p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the &#8220;Oslo Accords&#8221; need the &#8220;politics of love&#8221; (Model #5 
  below) if the negotiators are to avoid the Masada affect.  The empirical reality 
  is that the presence of the acknowledgement of love in Models 2 and 3 were successful, 
  and that its absence led to the failure of #1 and is leading to the failure 
  of #4.  #5 organizes this principle for any macro-level conflict negotiation. </p>
<p><strong>FIFTH<a name="FIFTH"></a>, the mediation model </strong>based on Michael Cassidy&#8217;s &#8220;The Politics of Love,&#8221; in his book The Passing Summer : A South African&#8217;s Response 
  to White Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love. </p>
<p>Cassidy proposed this model for South Africa, with the urging that it be incorporated 
  in the country&#8217;s constitution.  As 78% of South Africans (Black and White) professed 
  to be Christians, the politics of love followed their shared belief that &#8220;God 
  is love.&#8221;  The model served as an inspiration to themselves regarding letting 
  their better natures prevail as continues to serve as in inspiration to other 
  peoples of the planet caught in the same kind of process.  The model is also 
  practical, in that &#8220;the golden rule is finally what life is all about&#8221; and is 
  at the heart of every major world religion and most secular philosophies.  But 
  how does a nation or large institution incorporate the golden rule all claim 
  to want to follow but find so difficult to follow?  Through love, which turns 
  revenge into treating perpetrators of prejudice with the respect and civility.  
  Cassidy regarding meetings with the head of detentions:  &#8220;I grasped afresh that 
  South African blacks, and especially black Christians, are in many ways incredible. 
  Their capacity to bear pain, to tolerate indignity, to dredge up new goodwill 
  from who knows where and still be gracious, never ceases to amaze me&#8221; (p. 19).</p>
<p>Cassidy discusses his ten point model in detail in his book&#8217;s Part Six, &#8220;The 
  Politics of Love (The outworking of love as a valid political principle,&#8221; in 
  three chapters, Chapter 19 (&#8221;Winning in the World&#8217;s Workshop&#8221; based on the Swiss 
  Hans-Ruedi Weber referring to South Africa as &#8220;the laboratory of the world,&#8221; 
  in 1973, for how they did would greatly affect the world&#8217;s belief in what is 
  possible), Chapter 20 (&#8221;Love as a Political Virtue&#8221; which is to sing songs Cassidy 
  doesn&#8217;t mention but which relate, the Dianne Warwick song &#8220;What the world needs 
  now, is love, love, love&#8221;, or the song made popular world-wide by Michael Jackson 
  and Pepsi Cola about the world needing love or Disney&#8217;s &#8220;It's a Small, Small 
  World After All&#8221;), and Chapter 21 (&#8221;Love in Structures&#8221;, as in the constitution, 
  etc.).</p>
<p>The 10 point model proposed in 1988 by Cassidy, p. 425, which is needed by 
  those involved in The Oslo Accords and any other global &#8220;hot spots&#8221; needing 
  conflict resolution, is:</p>

<p>In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt says we 
  keep chaos at bay by keeping promises and that we deal with the irreversibility 
  of our words and deeds through forgiveness, that forgiveness and reconciliation 
  are not the provenance of Christians, although Jesus emphasizes it more than 
  anyone, but rather that both are necessary because of the &#8220;human condition.&#8221;  
  To forgive in order to be reconciled requires loving.  Love is what is missing 
  in the Middle East with the Oslo Accords.  Without love, it will ultimately 
  fail.  Love and reconciliation are a necessary part of the human condition.</p>
<p>Macro models 2, 3 and 5 show love as a key ingredient for macro conflict resolution.  
  Models 1 and 4 suggest that its lack prevents resolution.  There is the evidence 
  of another contemporary, long term, unresolved, unreconciled, loveless conflict:  
  Korea.  The unsuccessful threatening Cold War rhetoric of Washington has not 
  worked.  The recent summit between North and South Korea was brought about by 
  South Korea&#8217;s Kim Dae Jung, using a mix of Christian compassion and Confucian 
  sincerity.  If this continues, this country could also be reconciled, using 
  the &#8220;politics of love.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>SIXTH<a name="SIXTH"></a>, the 1975 Helsinki Accords</strong>, In terms of the 
  Helsinki Accords, I would juxtapose them with the Oslo Accords as well as with 
  Masada, both of which failed (interestingly enough, both failures were in the 
  Middle East), as I predicted in the items I&#8217;m sending to you, as both Oslo and 
  Masada were unable to either recognize and/deal with hate and mistrust, and 
  neither was able to view with love.  According to Natan Sharansky, the signing 
  of the 1975 Helsinki Accords by the Soviet tyrants was when they &#8220;signed their 
  own death warrant&#8221;  (&#8221;Why Weren&#8217;t the Helsinki Standards Also Used for Oslo?" 
  Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2001, p. A18).  This &#8220;third basket&#8221; meant the Soviets 
  and their puppets were agreeing  &#8220;to uphold the basic human rights of their 
  own subjects&#8221;, although they had no intentions of doing so.  But this was the &#8220;Achilles&#8217; heel of the totalitarian state&#8221; as all actions were then scrutinized 
  by world opinion according to this agreement (that, plus going bankrupt trying 
  to keep up the arms race, while also intervening militarily in Vietnam and Afghanistan).  
  The &#8220;Kremlin eventually buckled under the strain,&#8221; as, &#8220;forced to relax their 
  tyranny, they released a spark of freedom that spread like a bush fire and burned 
  down an empire&#8221;, a reminder from the East to the West that &#8220;freedom has the 
  power to change the world.&#8221;    Sharansky says the real lesson lost by the Oslo 
  accord folks was that the Soviet &#8220;historic collapse was shaped by the moral 
  authority of dissidents&#8221; in Russia and the moral authority of certain political 
  leaders in the U.S. willing to use the phrase &#8220;evil empire,&#8221; which brought near 
  apoplexy from the left in this country. Sharansky's bottom line:  &#8220;the Oslo 
  accords failed to establish any connection between human rights and the Israeli-Palestinian 
  peace process.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>SEVENTH<a name="SEVENTH"></a>, the "third track diplomacy"</strong> contributions 
  and structures of the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Mozambique, Central 
  and South America, and South Korea.  Berger reminds us that the U.S. population 
  as a whole is as religious as India whereas the political and academic elites 
  are as secular as Sweden.  This explains to me why they can&#8217;t deal with morality, 
  as it would be a foot in the door for religion, and religion must be stamped 
  out at every point (see comment on Voltaire below).  And religion, more than 
  any other, teaches morality and love.  The recent (1999) book edited by Peter 
  Berger, The Desecularization of the World:  Resurgent Religion and World Politics, 
  includes a piece by George Weigel, &#8220;Roman Catholicism in the Age of John Paul 
  II.&#8221;  In it he discusses what John Paul II has done as well as the &#8220;third track 
  diplomacy&#8221; of the Rome-based San&#8217; Egidio Community, which he says has played 
  important roles in 3rd track, &#8220;most successfully in Mozambique.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major difference is the lack of a concept of sin on the political left, 
  for if there is no sin, how can what one is doing be all that wrong?  The moral 
  strength of Gandhi in India was not his but England&#8217;s self image as a moral 
  nation, sinful though it may be, but one that didn't slaughter people, and thus 
  had to withdraw on those moral grounds (a concept totally missing, of course 
  in the Soviet Union and any past and present Marxist states).  Ditto in South 
  Africa:  it was the vision of people, Black and White, both Christians, that 
  enabled apartheid to be put back in its box.  The key now is to prevent its 
  reverse.  And the civil rights movement in this country was also fought on a 
  moral base.  Martin Luther King could not have been as effective as he was, 
  nor the supreme court able to rule as it did, if it wasn't for the moral sense 
  that counted, the moral sense of everyday Americans, who were revulsed by such 
  scenes as Bull Connor's dogs and the beating of unarmed, peaceful marchers, 
  not to mention the bombing of little girls and the lynching of innocent men, 
  and who said, "but that is not us," ushering in the change.  What nation can 
  survive without such a moral base as it relates to its citizens and to its fellow 
  nations?</p>
<p>But even in moral nations, we need the &#8220;politics of love&#8221; (sin, and all that, 
  one must recall, aren't going away).  Too many seem to have Voltaire&#8217;s wish.  
  Weigel writes that Voltaire &#8220;died with the wish that the last king be strangled 
  with the guts of the last priest.&#8221;  For all of his defense to the death of one's 
  right to speak their opinion, &#8220;the revolution he helped to inspire defined its 
  goal as little less than the overthrow of the civilization the Church had helped 
  nurture for centuries.&#8221;  When I was in graduate school, those of my fellow grad 
  students who were Marxists told me I would be one of the first ones shot come 
  the revolution (which they sincerely believed would come).  I said yes, but 
  you&#8217;ll be beside me, as the first to go are the intellectuals.   Graduate school 
  in the classroom with Berger was exciting, but with fellow grads disappointing.   
  The left is so lacking in balanced morals (and the concept of "moral equivalency" 
  negates morals, making what is moral what one personally "feels" to be moral, 
  i.e., anything anyone does).  But how can you have a sense of morals that is 
  all encompassing of all people if you don&#8217;t have a concept of sin and therefore 
  believe any action of one's own can't, by definition be wrong?  If one thinks 
  it OK it is by definition OK, as seen by those who are "historically specific 
  conservatives" on both the left and right.</p>

<p><strong>NINTH<a name="NINTH"></a>, The Ubuntu Theology of Reconciliation</strong> 
  model of South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu&#8217;s theology is seen 
  in the title of this book: <strong>No Future Without Forgiveness.</strong> Additional 
  understanding can be gained from the book <strong>Reconciliation: The Ubuntu 
  Theology of Desmond Tutu</strong> by Michael Battle (1993). Additional books 
  of value include <strong>The Passing Summer: A South African's Response to White 
  Fear, Black Anger, and the Politics of Love,</strong> by Michael Cassidy, <strong>A 
  Future South Africa: Visions, Strategies, and Realities,</strong> edited by 
  Peter L. Berger and Bobby Godsell (1988). Tutu says &#8220;We have got a thing 
  which we call <strong>ubuntu,</strong> which means humanity&#8230;For Tutu, 
  <strong>Ubuntu</strong> really means that &#8220;I am because you are. We belong 
  together. Our humanity is bound up with one another. We say in our languages, 
  a person is a person through other persons. A solitary human being is a contradiction 
  in terms. <strong>I learn how to become a human being through association with 
  other human beings.&#8221;</strong> In other words, no matter how appropriate 
  "individualism" is, "No man is an island," as John Donne wrote. Our independence 
  is actually interdependence with each other.</p>
<p>Tutu chaired the <strong>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</strong> which 
  was established to heal the raw wounds of South Africa&#8217;s past, consisted 
  of three committees: <strong>Amnesty</strong> Committee, <strong>Reparation 
  and Rehabilitation</strong> (R&R) Committee and <strong>Human Rights Violations</strong> 
  (HRV) Committee. <strong>Tutu's concern</strong> was this: as Apartheid ended, 
  what would keep <strong>Whites</strong> from withdrawing into armed enclaves 
  and what would keep <strong>Blacks</strong> from wanting to do to Whites what 
  Whites had done to them? <strong>How could they be reconciled? </strong> For 
  Archbishop Tutu, one word: <strong>"ubuntu:</strong> I am because we are&#8230;a 
  person is a person through other persons." In fact, it has been such <strong>an 
  excellent model of conflict resolution that some hope it will be introduced 
  in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.</strong> The Truth and Reconciliation 
  Commission chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu <strong>heard statements from 
  20,000 witnesses, some 15 percent in public.</strong> Showing reconciliation 
  was possible, the committee proved it by being even-handed: criticizing <strong>both</strong> 
  the Apartheid regime <strong>and</strong> the ANC for the excesses of their 
  brutality. You can read more on the official web site of South Africa's <strong>Truth 
  and Reconciliation Commission</strong>. Throughout, <strong>the key is reconciliation.</strong> 
  It can be done. It must be done. As with the other macro models, it is worked 
  through at the micro level. We look forward to seeing it applied elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>The establishment of South Africa&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation 
  Commission was a pioneering international event.</strong> Never had any country 
  sought <strong>to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing 
  the atrocities committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former 
  oppressors. </strong> In 1995, Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize Winner was about 
  to retire as Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town when Nelson Mandela asked him 
  to stay on and become the Chairman of the Commission. Tutu argues that true 
  reconciliation cannot be achieved by denying the past. <strong>His emphasis: 
  restorative justice over retributional justice. </strong> For Tutu, <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 
  is the African expression that was at the heart of the TRC&#8217;s labors: &#8220;a 
  person is a person through other people.&#8221; <strong> Ubuntu</strong> sums 
  up Tutu&#8217;s philosophical framework for addressing apartheid&#8217;s hard 
  truths and beginning the reconciliation process necessary to move beyond apartheid&#8217;s 
  legacy. Human rights, he affirms, cannot stand without <strong>Ubuntu</strong>'s 
  deeper foundation; <strong>the future cannot be without forgiveness. </strong>He 
  writes: <strong>&#8220;To forgive is indeed the best form of self-interest</strong> 
  since anger, resentment, and revenge are corrosive of that &#8216;summum bonum,&#8217; 
  the greatest good.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Kirkus Reviews "No Future Without Forgiveness":</strong> the "&#8230;story 
  of South Africa&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a meditation 
  on evil and forgiveness from Nobel laureate Tutu (The Rainbow People of God: 
  The Making of a Peaceful Revolution, 1994). In 1994, South Africa faced a historically 
  unique situation. A long-oppressed majority had peacefully taken power from 
  its minority oppressor. As Tutu explains, <strong>the question facing the nation 
  was, What then to do? Should Nuremberg-like trials be held against those who 
  had maintained the ghastly system of apartheid? Or, as many whites wished, should 
  the past be forgotten, let bygones be bygones?</strong> The new regime found 
  what Tutu calls <strong>&#8220;a third way&#8221;</strong> to deal with the 
  past: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Those who had committed politically 
  motivated crimes during the apartheid era would receive <strong>amnesty if they 
  made full and truthful public disclosures.</strong> In turn, the<strong> victims 
  of such acts would be allowed to tell their stories</strong> in the hopes that 
  this would restore a measure of their human dignity. <strong>Over 18 months 
  some 20,000 victims</strong> appeared before the commission, imparting their 
  tales of personal anguish-of torture, rape, imprisonment-but also <strong>exposing 
  a system perpetrated and supported by the highest levels of government, military, 
  and police. No longer could anyone deny knowledge of the past, as so many whites 
  had; never again would such an evil be allowed to exist in South Africa. </strong> 
  Yet it would be not only supporters of apartheid answering for their deeds. 
  <strong>Those who had committed crimes in the fight against the system, including 
  Winnie Mandela, would answer for their acts as well.</strong> Tutu&#8217;s writing 
  on this process is nothing short of miraculous. He is strong in his defense 
  of the commission that so many doubted as either too harsh or too lenient. He 
  is also anguished by the depths of human depravity the commission hearings revealed, 
  but passionately hopeful <strong>that human caring and unity might prevail,</strong> 
  in South Africa and the world. [a] sober depiction and searing indictment of 
  evil and [a] never-maudlin <strong>advocacy of love." </strong> </p>
<p><strong><a name="micro"></a>THE 9 MICRO MODELS</strong></p>
<p>Those interested in education in any town or city, are urged to think beyond 
  the conflict resolution<a name="resolution"></a> process at the institutional 
  level (the 5 macro models above) and think also of the conflict resolution process 
  within their own minds between their &#8220;better&#8221; and &#8220;worse&#8221; selves as well as 
  between themselves and those they must resolve conflicts with face to face, 
  at home, at work, or at school (the 5 micro models below).  A recommended starting 
  place is to consider either the adoption of one of the following models or the 
  development of another model taking elements from any of the other models, whether 
  approached in terms of outcomes or in terms of personal procedures to follow.  
  These micro, face-to-face relationship models can enable people to approach 
  different tasks using the terminology of the field of conflict resolution, enabling 
  the kinds of effective inter-personal relationships that will foster, support 
  and sustain task completion.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST: a full spectrum model</strong>l from lose-lose to win-win, to use as a 
  guide in how well you are doing in developing a win-win model, with the outcome 
  goal being that of collaboration, as seen on the following Chart of Win-Lose 
  Strategies for Task Completion/Relationship Building.</p>
<p><strong>LIST</strong> below of chart<a name="chart"></a> of the &#8220;Win-Lose Spectrum 
  Regarding Strategies for Task Completion/Relationship Building</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong>  Work diagonally toward collaboration to achieve tasks/goals 
  in a win-win manner</p>
<p><img src="../images/winlosechart.jpg" alt="Win-Lose Spectrum" width="488" height="288"></p>
<p>The previous chart was adapted by Peter Jessen from the model presented by 
  John Conhere who in tern presented his adaptation of the model of Ken Thomas, 
  in Conhere&#8217;s "Peer Mediation" presentation, Fridley Middle School, Fridley, 
  MN, Jan. 19, 1993, and used by Peter Jessen in his presentation of "THE MOTIVATION 
  ZONE:  Heroes at Work with Heroes in Training:  Background, Rationale and 'Curriculum' 
  For Parents & Kids,"  before a meeting of the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection 
  Meeting, Wilson High School, Portland, OR, March 11, 1996, and before the Wilson 
  High School Leadership Group in December 1998. </p>
<p>Key to task success is to understand how to meld each stakeholder&#8217;s and stakeholder 
  group&#8217;s plans, agendas and &#8220;to do lists&#8221; into a recipe which includes the concept 
  of collaboration.  Following Meichenbaum&#8217;s Facilitating Treatment Adherence:  
  A [medical] Practitioner&#8217;s Guidebook, by Donald Meichenbaum and Dennis C. Turk;  
  and Meichenbaum personal statement to Peter Jessen) &#8220;collaboration&#8221; is further 
  defined as that which must be understood within the context that no collaboration 
  can take place unless everything is negotiable.  &#8220;Non-negotiable&#8221; means conflicts 
  cannot be resolved and collaboration cannot be achieved.  Without collaboration 
  on negotiable items, there can be no Win-Win.   Each group must drop its Wizard 
  of Oz-ian curtains.</p>
<p>Referring to Chart: Left to right = ascending degree of task completion.  <br>
         Bottom to top = ascending quality of relationships.</p>
<p>Avoidance (not face) = lose -  lose. </p>
<p>Accommodates (giving in) = lose - win, as high level of task completion is 
  sacrificed for the sense of relationship. </p>
<p>Controller = win-lose is at the other end of the spectrum is the (where high 
  task completions are obtained by sacrificing relationships).  And although compromise 
  has some value, its half win, half lose (not very satisfying to either).</p>
<p>Collaboration is the one that is highest in both relationship building and 
  task completion.  Collaboration is the only one which is win-win and the best 
  for long-term win-win.  BUT, collaboration only works with that which is negotiable.  
  Caveat:  &#8220;consensus trumps collaboration&#8221; (&#8221;consensus leadership&#8221; allows one 
  or two stop the rest in their tracks).</p>
<p><strong>SECOND: a win<a name="win"></a>-lose matrix</strong> model for fostering the 
  developing a win-win model of development of the young by their elders (parents 
  and teachers).</p>
<p>This model was adapted from Mary Pipher, Rescuing Ophelia:  Saving the Selves 
  of Adolescent Girls, p. 83, by Peter Jessen, and used in his November 12, 1996 
  presentation before the Wilson Cluster Parent Connection:  &#8220;From the &#8216;Reviving 
  of Ophelia&#8217; to &#8216;The Shelter of Each Other&#8217;:  The Questions, Answers, and Tools 
  Mary Pipher Offers For Use in &#8216;Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls&#8217; and in &#8216;Rebuilding our Families&#8217; and Communities into &#8216;Tiospayes&#8217;.&#8221; </p>
<p>This matrix outlines the outcomes that result with any of the four control 
  strategies implemented by adults over their young, whether at home or at school.  
  The favored outcome is a strategy which includes high affection and acceptance 
  by the adults, meaning, in a word, love.  This one is favored because the outcome 
  is an independent, socially responsible, and confident young man or woman. </p>
<p>Indeed, Part III of her book The Shelter of Each Other is entitled:  &#8220;Solutions:  
  What will survive of us is love.&#8221;  In this she is in agreement with Cassidy 
  (Macro model #3).  The following matrix responds to Mary Pipher&#8217;s question:  &#8220;Under what conditions will young men and women flower and grow?&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="../images/controlchart.jpg" alt="Control Chart" width="464" height="303"></p>
<p><strong>THIRD:  a set<a name="set"></a> of personal self-talk</strong> or internal-dialogues, 
  with the outcome goal being that of developing a sense of learned optimism, 
  not learned helplessness, so as to raise one&#8217;s Adversity Quotient, for the higher 
  the AQ the easier and more successful one will be in overcoming adversity.  
  The clue concept is that of self-talk, of which there are several models, which 
  are discussed in Appendix C.  All of them can be subsumed under Paul Stoltz&#8217;s 
  concept with the book title of the same name:  Adversity Quotient:  Turning 
  Obstacles into Opportunities.  Stoltz notes that the American Psychological 
  Association considers the &#8220;learned helplessness&#8221; concept of Martin E.P. Seligman, 
  as &#8220;the Landmark Theory of the Century.&#8221;  It explains why people give up or 
  stop short when faced with life&#8217;s challenges.  This theory suggests that the 
  shooters at Columbine felt helpless.  The concept &#8220;Learned Helplessness&#8221; is 
  the personal thought process of &#8220;simply internalizing the belief that what you 
  do does not matter.&#8221;  The old wisdom statement is &#8220;As a man thinketh.&#8221;  Stoltz 
  has created two ways of using self-talk (again, see Appendix C) to be positive, 
  optimistic, and tackle any challenge.  These two are CO2RE and LEAD. </p>
<p>To Stoltz, adversity is like a mountain to climb (a &#8220;vertical&#8221; version of the &#8220;horizontal&#8221; version of running a marathon).  Three types attempt the climb:  
  quitters, who either don&#8217;t start or who quit soon after starting; campers, who 
  climb for a while and then pitch their tents hoping for conditions to change 
  that they prefer, and just keep waiting, and climbers, who continue, no matter 
  what, to the top.  Stoltz&#8217;s goal for us:  to each develop and nurture as high 
  an AQ behavior as possible, to grow a high AQ culture in every organization 
  or group in which one participates, and to thereby each is emailed tpunleash 
  each of our full potential.  The key question (p. 281):  &#8220;How important is it 
  for you to strengthen your AQ and your ability to climb through adversity?&#8221;  
  Like Stoltz, we all want to achieve Seligman&#8217;s &#8220;Learned optimism&#8221; as a way to 
  change beliefs such that one can see that it does matter what they try, and 
  that they also matter.  Stoltz has three key terms:<br>
   <br>
    CO2RE                         LEADing               Vision<br>
   <br>
  Learn CO2RE (p. 115) and LEADing (p. 154) to create a climbing culture, and 
  develop the Vision (pp. 284-5) needed to sustain it.  Teaching AQ to others 
  gives them a great gift:  the ability to confront challenge after challenge 
  <br>
   <br>
  <strong>C</strong> = Control:  focus on what you can control, not what you cannot 
  control<br>
  <strong>O2</strong> = Origin and Ownership (how did it start; what is your part 
  of the solution)<br>
   <br>
  <strong>R</strong> = Reach (goal:  don&#8217;t allow catastrophising to spill over 
  into other areas)<br>
   <br>
  <strong>E</strong> = Endurance (to reduce how long the adversity will last)<br>
   <br>
   <br>
  <strong>L</strong> = Listen to your adversity response:  high or low?<br>
  <strong>E</strong> = Explore all origins and your own ownership of the result<br>
  <strong>A</strong> = Analyze the evidence (regarding whether you have no control, 
  regarding if it really must reach other areas, and regarding whether it really 
  has to last a long time)<br>
  <strong>D</strong> = Do something!  (act).<br>
   <br>
  p. 155:  &#8220;The LEAD sequence is based on the notion that anyone can alter their 
  success by changing their habits of thought.  Change is created by disputing 
  old patterns and consciously forming new ones.&#8221;<br>
   <br>
  Proverbs 29:18:  &#8220;Where there is no vision, the people perish.&#8221;  Stoltz says 
  that to overcome adversity in a sustained way, one must first dream the dream, 
  then make the dream into a vision, and then sustain the vision, hold on to it, 
  and not let it go.  P. 287:  &#8220;AQ is not a quick fix, but rather an enduring 
  formula built on a fundamental truth that life is hard&#8212;but how you handle it 
  determines your destiny.&#8221;  Recall the discussion above of Frankl:  even though 
  life is filled with suffering, guilt, and death, individuals can still derive 
  meaning from their pain and suffering.  Because of vision, people know the joy 
  of &#8220;life is beautiful:  &#8220;As long as one is alive, they can ascend.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>FOURTH:  the model<a name="model"></a> &#8220;Managing Conflict for Individual 
  & Team Success At Home and At School,&#8221; </strong>presented to the Wilson Cluster Parent 
  Connection, May 13, 1997, by Sam Imperati, Executive Director for The Institute 
  for Conflict Management, Inc., and JoAnn Hjouck, Mediator, Solomon&#8217;s Tree.  
  This model begins with the reality that &#8220;conflict arises in all relationships,&#8221; 
  that conflict arises when someone insists they are right and you are wrong, 
  and that the goal is to avoid the &#8220;standard&#8221; model, stated tongue in cheek, 
  of &#8220;I&#8217;ll listen to your unreasonable demands if you&#8217;ll consider my unacceptable 
  offer,&#8221; and that to succeed in conflict resolution, even between two people, 
  those involved must act as a team even when they come from different places/organizations/families/schools, 
  etc.  And although not a replacement for the traditional legal process, it can 
  compliment it by providing a creative, economical and effective alternative 
  to expensive law suits.  This means that those in conflict but build relationships, 
  not a case, and that they must understand that they are to fix a problem not 
  fix blame.  This model has four steps:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> 1.  Identify the problem by getting both sides to understand what the other&#8217;s 
    position(s) and argument(s) is/are and to recognize that they can solve the 
    problem.</p>
  <p> 2.  Explore the problem by looking at the underlying values, needs, and 
    interests of each party, identifying what each has in common, and then exploring 
    the best case-worst case scenarios regarding the consequences of not reaching 
    a resolution. </p>
  <p> 3.  Develop solutions by listing all possible solutions, and then exploring 
    the options in terms of which solutions satisfy common interests (O.P.T.I.O.N.S.:  
    only proposals that include others&#8217; needs succeed). </p>
  <p> 4.  Select and implement a solution by negotiating a winning solution that 
    will generate full support now and in the future, and not ending without laying 
    out procedures to follow if what is worked out worsens or, for whatever reason, 
    the agreement reached is not working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FIFTH:  the Lists<a name="Lists"></a>/Recipes</strong> for empowering both sides 
  to achieve success model, compiled by Peter J. Jessen.  As human beings have 
  no instincts for social interaction (Berger&#8217;s phrase), they &#8220;create instinct 
  substitutes&#8221; (Gehlen&#8217;s phrase).  They create habits.  These habits are said 
  to follow the recipes needed for success.  People seek &#8220;recipe knowledge&#8221; (Schutz&#8217;s 
  phrase).</p>
<p>It derives from three concepts:  (1) the social fact that humans have no instincts 
  for human interaction nor for keeping track of things, and that to survive, 
  must create &#8220;instinct substitutes,&#8221; which are call roles.   Every situation 
  in which any person finds themselves, is a stage, and each stage has its own 
  called for role playing, behavior, costume, etc.  No one can live a role free 
  existence.  (2), because of this, anyone can, individually and collectively, 
  be a playwright and participate in creating the stages on which they play, and 
  the plays in which they play their roles.  (3), individuals  are capable of 
  not only living in multiple realities AND are capable of emigrating freely back 
  and forth between them.  Nothing, therefore, is inevitable.  All can be negotiated, 
  worked out (except in those cases where individuals or groups choose not to.  
  This also means that role playing is more important than one&#8217;s feelings, that 
  no matter how one feels, the old theatre adage that &#8220;the show must go on&#8221; is 
  far more prevalent as a reflection of the realities of life than &#8220;when I get 
  energized and feel great&#8221; I will get going.  This must be the attitude of any 
  who would overcome adversity and anyone who would engage in the &#8220;school mission 
  marathon&#8221; to answer the questions before us, let along the attitude that must 
  be in the heads of both students and teachers/administrators, if all of them 
  are to get the most out of the K-12 educational experience marathon.  Lists/recipes 
  for action are key to organizing the thoughts and actions one needs to achieve 
  goals.  Some of lists include those of Stephen Covey&#8217;s &#8220;7 Habits Habits of Highly 
  Effective People and Families,&#8221; Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s list of 13 areas for achieving 
  personal and professional success, the list of Dale Carnegie&#8217;s success principles, 
  the list of success principles of Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone, 6 lists 
  for goal setting by Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, Robert Schuller, Peter Daniels, 
  Paul Stoltz, and Napoleon Hill, as well as a list of books of lists by Sam Deep 
  and Lyle Sussman.</p>
<p><strong>SIXTH:  the Love<a name="Love"></a> each other model</strong>, as admonished 
  by Jesus, the Buddha, and Mohammed.  Hannah Arendt says the human condition 
  requires forgiving others, as words and deeds are irreversible, and keeping 
  promises, as that keeps chaos at bay.  Christians celebrate the Jewish Passover 
  as Maundy Thursday (Maundy having roots from three languages:   derived from 
  mandatum, Latin, &#8220;commandment&#8221;; also derived from the English, &#8220;Mandate&#8221;; and 
  derived from the French, &#8220;Mande,&#8221; meaning &#8220;command&#8221; or &#8220;mandate&#8221;).  For some, 
  it refers to Jesus foot washing of his disciples and His command to serve one 
  another.  To others it refers to his command to love one another (both of which 
  are common to all peoples of the Book:  Christians, Jews, Moslems).  To me it 
  refers to and includes both.  Or, as the liturgy at http://www.rockies.net/~spirit/sermons/s-maundy-thursday.html 
  states it:</p>
<p>MAUNDY is an English form of the Latin word for commandment. The overarching 
  theme of Maundy Thursday is Jesus&#8217; new commandment, given on this the eve of 
  his death, to &#8220;love one another even as I have loved you&#8221; (John 13:34) Maundy 
  Thursday is the night of the final meal that Jesus had with his disciples. The 
  night in which he washed his disciples feet, saying after he had done so: (John 
  13:12-17) &#8220;Do you understand what I have done for you? You call me &#8216;Teacher&#8217; 
  and &#8216;Lord,&#8217; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and 
  Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet. I have 
  set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the 
  truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than 
  the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if 
  you do them.</p>
<p>What makes the events of 9/11/01 so mystifying for many, is that all three 
  religions who share and are all three called "The Peoples of The Book," Judaism, 
  Christianity, and Islam, have members with different interpretations and who 
  thus have adopted roles not of loving and serving but of hating and killing.</p>
<p><strong>SEVENTH:  the "Serve<a name="Serve"></a> others model"</strong>, as admonished 
  by Jesus, the Buddha, and Mohammed.  Albert Schweitzer said:  "I don' know what 
  you will do in life, but I do know you won't be happy until you learn to serve 
  others."</p>
<p><strong>EIGHTH:  putting<a name="putting"></a> top individuals </strong>of conflicting 
  organizations in the anchoring environment of a Round Table, as was used by 
  King Author for his Knights of the Round Table, in order to get them to act 
  cooperatively together, and as was used by Katherine Graham, Publisher of The 
  Washington Post, to foster open communications where suspicioned communications 
  existed before. (just as its counter part, in macro, is on a formal basis). </p>
<p><strong>NINTH: The forgiveness model for reconciliation</strong> of Jewish scholar, Hannah 
  Arendt.</p>
<p>In Macro #5 above, we read: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In her book, The Human Condition, the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt says <strong>we 
    keep chaos at bay by keeping promises and that we deal with the irreversibility 
    of our words and deeds through forgiveness, </strong> that forgiveness <strong>and 
    reconciliation</strong> are not the provenance of Christians, although Jesus 
    emphasizes it more than anyone, but rather that both are necessary because 
    of the &#8220;human condition.&#8221; To forgive in order to be reconciled requires loving. 
    Love is what is missing in the Middle East's Oslo Accords. Without love, it 
    will ultimately fail. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also reminded in Micro #6 of Hannah Arendt's insight that <strong>the human 
  condition is such that we are not perfect, and</strong> that we do and say things 
  we wish we did not say or do. Once said or done it is irreversible. Therefore, 
  <strong>all we can do if we want to stay in positive human relationships is to reconcile 
  through forgiveness. </strong> Apologizing also helps. The best reconciliation comes 
  when whoever should be apologizing does and who ever should be forgiving does. 
  But if there is no apology, <strong>forgiveness is still required to be a human being 
  free of the oppression of anger and holding grudges against others. </strong> Why? 
  Because, again, words and deeds are irreversible. Confessing and forgiveness 
  are easier when we keep our promises, as that, she says, helps to keep chaos 
  at bay. This fits handily with Archbishop Tutu's <strong>Ubuntu Theology of Forgiveness 
  model (Macro #9). </strong> Too often we hate first and stay that way and thus <strong>love 
  gets lost, and the chances of reconciliation are lost as well, </strong> causing 
  fights among individuals at the micro level and war between countries at the 
  macro level. Ironically, those most often calling for peace (think of the anti-war 
  movement regarding our Civil War or regarding Vietnam or Iraq) or calling for 
  people to do good (think of the far right attacks against Bill Clinton and the 
  far left attacks against George W. Bush). Arendt says it is too bad that forgiveness 
  is seen as a Jesus thing, as <strong>all peoples, all cultures, all religions need 
  to be in reconciliation, as it is part of what is needed to deal effectively 
  with the human condition of imperfection. </strong> Jesus, she said, just said it 
  best. <strong>Those who can't forgive cannot be reconciled and those who can't or 
  won't be reconciled can't or won't love, and set the stage for continued conflict. 
  </strong> Conflict resolution requires reconciliation which is always easier when 
  there is at least an element of love involved. And love, admonished Jesus (and 
  sometimes Buddha and Mohammed), is what makes harmony among people and peoples 
  possible. This, along with others is a sober and clear-sighted example of spiritual 
  politics at its best. <strong>Best rule? The Golden Rule. </strong> </p>
<p><strong>An excellent source of &#8220;<a href="file:///ancilplace/jobs/websites/peterjessen/pages/listrecipes.html">lists/recipes</a>&#8221; 
  </strong>is any program based on "six sigma", the concept behind the concept of TQM 
  (total quality management), which is to minimize errors and, thus, defects.  
  Although designed for organizations as a whole, it also designed for use individually, 
  and can be used by such disparate organizations as manufacturing plants and 
  public schools.</p>
<p>A "P.S." to these 8 macro and 8 micro models for conflict resolution</p>
<p>Note that the 2 KEYS to all of these 18 models is their organization.  It is 
  recommended that their organizational principle be that of <strong>(1)  L-I-S-T-S/R-E-C-I-P-E-S</strong> 
  (as part of goals, plans, contingencies, time lines), and <strong>(2) c-o-l-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-I-o-n</strong> 
  (with all as negotiable).</p>
<p>As Berger further points out, social scientists talk about the reality that &#8220;every society has its own corpus of officially accredited wisdom, the beliefs 
  and values that most people take for granted as self-evidently true.&#8221;  In terms 
  of education, there are multiple realities involved, each viewing education 
  differently, from the unique position of its own prism of reality.  This was 
  not the case &#8220;in the old days&#8221;, when, as Berger writes:  &#8220;Every human society 
  has institutions and functionaries whose task it is to represent this putative 
  truth, to transmit it to each new generation, to engage in rituals that reaffirm 
  it, and sometimes to deal (at least in words) with those who are benighted or 
  wicked enough to deny it.&#8221;  This used to be an easy task when there was a dominant 
  set of beliefs and values that everyone took for granted.  But modern society 
  is pluralistic, with multiple realities or worldviews that change, hence the 
  saying of W.R. Inage, that &#8220;he who would marry the spirit of the age soon becomes 
  a widower.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are two other organizing principles which recommend for consideration 
  by both the macro models and the micro models, both suggested by Peter Berger.  
  The first is a &#8220;calculus of meaning&#8221; and a &#8220;calculus of pain,&#8221; from his book 
  Pyramids of Sacrifice:  Political Ethics and Social Change, in which he suggests 
  that policies should be those which provide the most meaning and the least pain, 
  and that each calculus include a list of outcomes that are not desirable, in 
  order to avoid the mistake of believing because the intent is pure, so will 
  be the outcome. </p>
<p>Secondly, adapting from another analytical framework of Peter Berger, it is 
  recommended that each of the stakeholders in the discussions that ensue review 
  whether or not they are arguing from an ideological position or not, whether 
  they are actually flexible with their thinking, and to ascertain whether or 
  not they are being &#8220;historically specific conservatives&#8221; or &#8220;historically non-specific 
  conservatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>This eliminates the argument over content labels (liberal vs. conservative, 
  Democrat vs. Republican), and instead focuses on the process.  In this way, 
  it can be state that both the radical left and the radical right are, hopelessly 
  and romantically, historically specific conservatives.  The radical left looks 
  forward to a future putative utopia which, when reached, is to be frozen in 
  place, never to change, because utopia has been achieved.  The radical right 
  looks backward to a putative golden age which it wishes to resurrect, after 
  which it too is to be frozen in place, as the golden age has been retrieved.  
  The historically NON-specific conservative recognizes yet resists the impulse 
  to fine a &#8220;good place&#8221; and to then rest and keep it that way, but also recognizes 
  that it is better to make haste slowly, and that as most historical actions 
  have unintended consequences, one needs to be slow in assuming that a proposed 
  policy or action is the solution.  The Spanish Civil War, which, like all wars, 
  was a conflict &#8220;full of moral ambiguities, with unspeakable brutality on both 
  sides,&#8221; in which a monument has been erected to the million who died, a monument 
  placed inside a mountain not far from &#8220;The Valley of the Fallen&#8221;.  Berger&#8217;s 
  chilling words about this should give us all pause and inspire us to be &#8220;historically 
  non-specific conservatives&#8221;:   And the Spain that is now emerging has nothing 
  to do with what either side fought and died for.   Or, as Cassidy put it in 
  his book, &#8220;Apartheid and all its works will pass away.  So will every answer 
  which replaces it, whether better and nobler or yet more sinful and worse.&#8221;</p>
