<p><strong><a name="0911b0917" id="0830b"></a>9-17-09, #11: The demise of the Minneapolis Urban League. </strong></p>
<p>At 5:15 p.m., today, Thursday, 9-17-09, Minneapolis Urban League Branch President Scott Gray announced, in closed session, the new austerity:  10% salary reduction across the board; termination of ten employees within 30 days; and an indication that the staff of the Urban League Street Academy would go on part time employee status (thus loosing their benefits). Ever since the sell outs kicked Nellie Stone Johnson and me out 20 years ago, when I was the President of the Urban League with 118 employees, they have cannibalized the organization, reducing it from the 118 employees then to what will be less than 20 employees now.  We show how this got started in Chapter 14 of <a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com" target="_blank">The Minneapolis Story</a>.</p>
