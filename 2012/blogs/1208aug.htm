<p><strong>STADIUM CONSTRUCTION &nbsp;MONITOR/WATCH/SCORECARD </strong><br>
(posting begun on Saturday, Aug&nbsp; 11, 2012, 2:10 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns</strong> that will impact on the Black Community:<br>
  1.&nbsp; Diversity, inclusion job hiring compliance<br>
  2.&nbsp; Delays<br>
  3.&nbsp; Cost Overruns<br>
  <strong>Predictions in past columns:</strong><br>
  1.&nbsp; Fight to achieve hiring compliance given <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/46DisparityCompliance.html">record of diversity non-compliance</a>.<br>
  2,&nbsp; &ldquo;<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2005/columns/05q2.htm#0509c0504">Blacks Need Not Apply&rdquo; column</a> of 9 projets, April 20, 2005<br>
  2.&nbsp; 1-2 year delay of opening<br>
  3.&nbsp; Lots of pigs fighting at the trough, offering nothing<br>
  4.&nbsp; Local liars will lead to out of state contractors<br>
  5.&nbsp; Hearings will reveal information disqualifying local firms<br>
  6.&nbsp; City and state will fight excellent planning suggesions, as <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/45aPlanningExpanded.html">here</a>, <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/44GuideForPlanning.htm">here</a>, and <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/42Planning.html">here</a>.<br>
  <strong>Repeatedly raised question:&nbsp; </strong>as companies working on the last five major projects (Target Field, TCF gophers Minn Board of Ed HQ on broadway, Fairview Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Light rail in St. Paul), were not in compliance minimally through 2010 (if not later), which essentially now serve as their auditions, what now, given they can&rsquo;t qualify for the Vikings stadium according to the Stadium legislation?<br>

<p><strong>TUESDAY, August 4, 2012.</strong><br>
  Could it be that the Vikings had to go out of state to Wisconsin to not only find a qualified firm, <a href="http://m.startribune.com/news/?id=164965336&c=y">Hammes Company</a> (did similar work on Laubeau Field, and on the Giants/Jets Stadium in New Jersey), but also to find one that has a record of diversity compliance lacking in Minnesota companies, that also has a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; record in hospital construction and can&rsquo;t be disqualified for failure to be in past compliance?&nbsp; <br>
Posted Saturday, Augut 11, 2012, 2:10 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY, August 3, 2012</strong><br>
  1.&nbsp; 34 contracts awarded, none to Blacks<br>
  2.&nbsp; 1 year delay probability announced:&nbsp; open in 2017 <br>
  3.&nbsp; 1st category of cost overrun announced:&nbsp; design delay up to a year.<br>
  4.&nbsp; Mondale:&nbsp; each year of delay adds $50M to cost<br>
  5.&nbsp; Design RFP for $40-50 million seems very high.<br>
  6.&nbsp; $750 million for environmental study suggests another year delay from findings.<br>
7.&nbsp; Legislation mandated equity plan still not completed and thus not in place, will add more delay.<br>
