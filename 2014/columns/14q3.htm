  <strong>Pull quote: </strong>How do we develop understandable common definitions for &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; and &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;?<br>
  <br>
  The media focus on the NFL&rsquo;s Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice hide<strong> <a href="http://www.commdiginews.com/news-2/ray-rice-domestic-violence-and-the-nfl-a-phony-problem-25857/#sysSCEGAHvAcTvFJ.99&rdquo;public" target="_blank">ideologies for bashing the NFL and its wealthy Black males</a>.</strong> As one commentaor put it, &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re facing is not an epidemic of man-against-woman violence in the NFL, but of <a href="http://www.commdiginews.com/news-2/ray-rice-domestic-violence-and-the-nfl-a-phony-problem-25857/#sysSCEGAHvAcTvFJ.99&rdquo;public" target="_blank">ideologically driven NFL bashing.</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about four things. I <strong>don&rsquo;t condone:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>1.  Any kind of abuse, physical or oral, spousal or child.<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>2. Whites getting preferential treatment over Blacks in prison/no prison options.<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>3. Choosing retribution/prison first when restorative second chances are possible.<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>4.  Rushing to dismiss &ldquo;due process&rdquo; and &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&rdquo; and <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>unwarranted imprisoning of fathers as abusers of their children.</p>
<p><strong>Ignored facts:</strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull; <a href="http://www.commdiginews.com/news-2/ray-rice-domestic-violence-and-the-nfl-a-phony-problem-25857/#sysSCEGAHvAcTvFJ.99&rdquo;public" target="_blank">NFL players are half as likely to commit domestic violence as men in their 20s in the general population</a>, according to a study published in USA Today.<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull; <a href="http://www.commdiginews.com/news-2/ray-rice-domestic-violence-and-the-nfl-a-phony-problem-25857/#sysSCEGAHvAcTvFJ.99&rdquo;public" target="_blank">&ldquo;Gender symmetry&rdquo; exists:</a> Men strike the first blow in 27 percent of the cases, women strike first in 24 percent of the cases, with violence a mutual brawl the remainder of the time.<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/domestic-abusers-can-reform-studies-show-1410822557?KEYWORDS=Domestic+abusers+can+reform+studies+show"><strong>Anti-abuse programs work. </strong></a>Thousands of men arrested for intimate-partner abuse have learned to become nonviolent. After four years (if they complete their programs), 90 percent are successful, with 85 percent of the women saying &ldquo;they now felt very safe.&rdquo; The success is because the men &ldquo;desire to save their relationship.&rdquo;<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	Former baseball commissioner<strong> Fay Vincent wrote two weeks ago</strong> that to punish once and then attempt to punish again <strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/fay-vincent-how-an-nfl-commissioner-needs-to-think-1410823139?KEYWORDS=how+an+NFL+commissioner+needs+to+think" target="_blank">smacks of double jeopardy</a></strong>(the guarantee against being &ldquo;twice put in jeopardy&rdquo; is a constitutional right).<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	Skin color in Minnesota is often the criteria for who is or is not picked for prosecution (see my 2002 book The Minneapolis Story). <strong>In chapter 15 (<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/38Chap15.htm" target="_blank">&ldquo;The Story of Punting the Minnesota Vikings&hellip;&rdquo;</a>)</strong>, I suggest that <strong>the White power structure is uncomfortable with highly paid and visible Black men in town,</strong> l<strong>i</strong>ving in their neighborhoods and playing on their golf courses, resulting in their desire that<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm" target="_blank"> &ldquo;the Vikings should move&rdquo; </a>(see my December 2, 2003<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm" target="_blank"> &ldquo;roll call&rdquo; of those saying so</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Important questions include:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	Is the hollow, false ring of Commissioner Goodell&rsquo;s statements about Ray Rice because Goodell is lying about not having seen the elevator tape seen by practically everyone else in the free world?<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	How do we develop understandable common definitions for &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; and &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;? Hence <strong>Adrian</strong> <strong>Peterson's</strong> statement that although <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/15/us/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-charges/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>&quot;not a perfect parent, I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser.&quot;</strong></a><br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	How do we factor in <strong>Charles Barkley&rsquo;s statements</strong>: <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Charles_Barkley_defends_whipping_kids.html" target="_blank">&ldquo;We spank kids in the South,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I'm from the South. Whipping &mdash; we do that all the time&rdquo;?</a> So what do we do? Jail every parent?<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull; <strong>Is the media focus because of conservatives who own teams and/or because the NFL is a stepping-stone to wealth and success for Black males?</strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	As <strong>Rice and Peterson told the truth and worked it out with the NFL, their teams and their families months ago</strong> (four months ago for Peterson, six months ago for Rice), why is this now treated as &ldquo;new,&rdquo; with media mobs racing to destroy these two Black families?<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	With assaults through public policy on Black families, don&rsquo;t we owe more to Peterson and Rice to allow them to demonstrate they understand the new boundaries of discipline, wanting to be good fathers, or is it more important to abuse their children by imprisoning their fathers and stripping away their means to support their families?<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	As Adrian Peterson is a good person well loved and respected in his hometown of Palestine, Texas and in Minnesota, how is it that a few minutes in his life are used to define many years of outstanding behavior, as Peterson credits his success in life to his strict discipline as a child (as does Charles Barkley)?<br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&bull;	Why is media using this to distract from real problems: racial tensions and injustices and serious threats to national security? Don&rsquo;t let this draw attention away from how Blacks are unequally treated, especially in the criminal justice system.<br>

  <br>

<p>September 17, 2014 <br>
  <br>
  <strong>There are efforts being made to draw America&rsquo;s attention away from Ferguson, Missouri</strong> in St. Louis County and the recent police killing in Ferguson of 18-year-old Michael Brown. <strong>White media is attempting to distract us</strong> with stories of Ray Rice, domestic violence, international conflicts, immigration, and the president&rsquo;s golf games. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>This is how magicians distract their audience,</strong> calling attention to one hand while the other hand pulls rabbits from hats, saws women in half, turn scarves into flying doves, and, in our case,<strong> turn a teenager preparing to go to college into a strong-arming thug.</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Media sleight of hand is also seen in their portrayal of Black young men as the violent drug users, whereas five times as many White Americans use drugs as Black Americans who are sent to prison at 10 times the rate of Whites.</strong> Black America must stay the course regarding Michael Brown. <br>
  <br>
  Mainstream media and officials at all levels (federal, state, local), offer <strong>distractions</strong> and <strong>misdirection</strong>, <strong>hoping to make Ferguson and negative race relations in America disappear as they wait to pull their containment plans out of their hats. </strong>This is now all challenged by the emergence of <strong>two new witnesses</strong> to the execution of 18-year-old Michael Brown, witnesses who are <strong>White</strong>, witnesses who <strong>support what Black witnesses have said</strong> (we broke the story on our blog radio show two hours before CNN reported it).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The two White witnesses raise tough questions for those who have gone to great lengths to show that Black witnesses aren&rsquo;t credible.</strong> One of those White witnesses had a 10-minute conversation with Michael Brown a half hour before his <strong>execution by Ferguson County police officer Darren Wilson. </strong><br>
  <br>
  The majority of media have distracted from Officer Wilson&rsquo;s first law enforcement job with the <strong>Jennings, Missouri police department, an all-White force in a city 95.4 percent Black</strong>, 37.7 miles away in the same county (as a whole: St. Louis County is 70.3 percent White, 23.3 percent Black). <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Jennings Black city council decided its all-White police department was so out of control in its acts of brutality against the Black community that it disbanded and fired those police officers,</strong> one of which was Officer Darren Wilson, Michael Brown&rsquo;s killer. <strong>Wilson found immediate employment in Ferguson, MO</strong>. These important facts add to our understanding of why race relations are kept poor in St. Louis County. It&rsquo;s not by accident. <br>
  <br>
  We are concerned.<strong> How can the St. Louis county attorney conduct an impartial and unbiased examination in light of his demonstrated extreme prejudice and bias against the Black citizens in the county</strong>, as we question his commitment to being fair and unbiased in the search for answers? Further troubling: As of this writing (September 9, 2014), we have yet to see any statement by Officer Darren Wilson, who has had quite a bit of turbulence in his life, even prior to becoming a law enforcement officer. <br>
  <br>
  The county&rsquo;s grand jury decision is to be rendered in October. We must take care not to be distracted from an investigation of the tragic taking of Michael Brown&rsquo;s life on August 29, 2014. <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Justice is now examining<strong> the long history of negative race relations between Ferguson&rsquo;s police and the Black community. </strong>Expect no surprises from this decades-long history of violating the rights and safety of Ferguson&rsquo;s African Americans <strong>[&ldquo;decades-long&rdquo; means white power works hard to maintain the status quo of no changes].<br>
  </strong><br>
  We like to think race relations progress is being made, another sleight of hand, as <strong>Ferguson is a clear example that race relations have improved little and that we as a nation have not worked out an answer for improving fairness and justice for all Black Americans. <br>
  </strong><br>
  Stay tuned. <br>

<p><strong><a name="c1437d0910" id="c1437d"></a>September, 10, 2014 #37: Ferguson and Homeland Security: Some ask:  
        &quot;Are they intertwined?&quot; We answer by asking: &quot;Why are they being intertwined?&quot;, becasue they are!<br>
</strong><br>
September 10, 2014<br>
<br>
<strong>Pull quote:</strong> We are concerned about this intensified examination and discussion regarding Black Americans, both male and female, as threats to our national security.<br>
<br>
As we watch closely the events in Ferguson and greater St. Louis County, Missouri, <strong>we are disturbed to hear Democrats and Republicans say it is somehow related to the threat to America&rsquo;s national security, as if Ferguson represents the beginning of an invasion from otherwise uninvolved Black communities.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>As threats are made by real terrorists </strong>to fly their flag over the White House, we appreciate the personal and nationalist threats, but, <strong>we don't like the false   suggestion thatit represents Black Americans</strong>. The sense of foreboding from the realness of the threats is being used as an excuse to tighten security for greater control of neighborhoods of color unrelated to the national security issues, as Ferguson demonstrates regarding the<strong> new debate over the militarization of urban police</strong> .<br>
<br>
<strong>The Black community is keenly aware that not since the roundup of Japanese Americans during the Second World War, and the creation of internment camps, and the expression of fear during the urban riots of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, has the Negro population been as unfairly painted as a threat to our national security.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase:</strong> We in the Twin Cities are <strong>at the epicenter of the call for a reexamination of constitutional guarantees</strong>. We as Black Americans have a front-row seat watching how <strong>we are painted as scapegoats in dealing with this foreign threat to America</strong>, resulting in undesired and troubling added layers of control on our neighborhoods by Homeland Security.<br>
  <br>
Just because three young men of American birth were killed fighting in Syria and Somalia under the flag of the newly declared Islamic State <strong>does not mean that because they are Black the same position is held by Black America.</strong> This kind of thinking is repeating the injustice to the Japanese in the 1940&rsquo;s and Black Americans in the 1960s. <strong>There is a difference between &ldquo;Somali American&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black American.</strong>&rdquo; It is very chilling as <strong>media and government officials discuss our Somali community as why America should fear its Black citizens. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Novels and movies have romanticized the thousands of Whites who joined foreign wars on both sides. It is not a Black thing.</strong><br>
  <br>
  Don&rsquo;t be fooled. This is real. <strong>The attorney for the U.S. district of Minnesota was summoned prior to these events to forge plans to deal with ISIS recruiting Somali Americans who are first-generation Americans born and raised here.</strong> In England there are more natural-born English citizens of Middle Eastern immigrants fighting for the Islamic State (IS) than serving in the British military.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>We are concerned about this intensified examination and discussion regarding Black Americans, both male and female, as threats to our national security.</strong> The early warning sign in Ferguson of <strong>the militarization of predominantly White law enforcement agencies</strong> in the St. Louis area could be an excuse to do the same in the Twin Cities.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Japanese Americans in the 1940s and African Americans in the 1960s were surprised, shocked and caught off guard </strong>by the swiftness their civil liberties and civil rights were taken away en masse, entire communities, not just individuals, <strong>despite many times their number of Whites that actively supported the Japanese, German, and Russian causes.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>We will not be surprised if Ferguson events regarding Officer Wilson are treated as business as usual</strong>, just as the same anger and frustration after the death of Trayvon Martin is just another forgotten American tragedy.<br>
  <br>
  Even though we are at the epicenter of the debate discussing race relations in and immigration to America, <strong>steps need to be taken to keep what happened in Ferguson from being an excuse to be a precursor of militarized responses to our neighborhoods.</strong><br>
  <br>
  Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Ed. note:</strong> this column was submitted to MSR September 3rd.  Since then white witnesses have stepped forth to corroborate much of what the dismissed Black witness said.  As white grand jury members give more credibility to white witnesses over Black ones, there may be a chance for justice yet.</p>

  <br>
  <strong>Pull quote: </strong>When asked at a recent public meeting to see workforce participation numbers, the MSFA could not produce the numbers.</p>
<p>Did you cheer the Vikings paying $50 million more toward stadium costs? Jeer instead<strong> the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA), state legislature and city council:  they </strong><strong> created this mess</strong>.<br>
  <br>
The Minneapolis Star Tribune, August 22-25, 2014 ran stories suggesting this cheers-jeers difference: <br>
<strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings">Vikings kick in $46 million more for new stadium<br>
  </a></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/272299061.html">Vikings pony up $49M for stadium accessories</a><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/272630791.html">Up close with Vikings' stadium contractor Dave Mansell</a></strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br>
  </strong><strong>It is not the MSFSA saving the Vikings, but &mdash; drum roll, please &mdash; the Wilf Vikings ownership group.</strong> We can hear MSFA and others cheer under their breath, <strong>&ldquo;Thank God for Ziggy.&rdquo;</strong><br>
  <br>
  Stadium costs have risen from $975 million to $1.023 billion (and will continue to climb as we predicted last year. <strong>We estimated last year that  the stadium cost oveun will eventually be at least $300 million).</strong><br>
  <br>
  There were more <strong>closed discussions, not transparency, again, this time in selecting the stadium&rsquo;s long-term manager: SMG</strong> (which fortunately enjoys a good relationship with the Wilfs through SMG&rsquo;s Jim Scherer, who they trust).<br>
  <br>
  The Audubon Society and birds found out just how irrelevant they are. <strong>The MSFA greatly underestimated European steel costs </strong>to be charged by the Luxemburg-India conglomeration sourcing the steel, <strong>wiping out discussions and promises to Minnesota&rsquo;s Iron Range, as we also predicted</strong> (see our December 4, 2012 column: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2013/columns/13q4.htm#c1349d1204" target="_blank"><strong>&ldquo;To the extent practical&rdquo; escape language in legislation allows steel purchase outside</strong> <strong>Iron Range</strong></a>).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Why didn&rsquo;t the MSFA exercise greater responsibility</strong> to pay greater attention to design and construction stages <strong>before signing</strong> (see stadium legislation language, p. 9, line 11.23 to line 11.28)?  Stadium profits provide long-term operational stability.<br>
  <br>
  The State, City and MSFA plans would not. SMG&rsquo;s will <strong>(Dallas and Washington make $200-300 million more than the other teams and their stadiums, using their stadiums as profit anchors, as we have advocated and shown &ldquo;how&rdquo; to Minnesota, Minneapolis and the Vikings</strong> (we mistakenly thought <strong>our &ldquo;no new taxes&rdquo; approach </strong>would interest City and State).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Contrary to what some believe, we have not been hard on the Vikings</strong>. We have merely gneo where the facts led:  the state and city not being in labor force compliance. <strong>We are hard only on those refusing to follow, support and/or stand up for state laws and city statutes regarding training and hiring of minority/diversity/people of color.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>We condemn avoiding hiring people of color by including White women in the count.</strong> <strong>Mondale told me personally, in an open meeting with others, that although they didn&rsquo;t comply on the other stadiums they would with the Vikings stadium. He lied.  Again.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>We now ask the Vikings to call a meeting of all stakeholders </strong>(State, City, contractors, venders) <strong>to design and exercise hiring compliance procedures</strong>, following legislatively directed diversity employment <strong>requirements and directives</strong> without the loopholes. It would be <strong>a great way to divert a Ferguson in Minneapolis.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>I have written extensively about the Vikings</strong>, Minnesota, Minneapolis and the stadium issue <strong>since 2002</strong>: book, columns; blog entries; solution papers (latest will be August 30, 2014): ).&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/38Chap15.htm">book</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocarchives.htm">columns</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocarchives.htm#blogacv">blog entries</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/solutionpapers/24rollcall.htm">solution papers</a>.</strong> &nbsp;<br>

<p>We rejoice that the<strong> 2018 Super Bowl</strong> will give the Vikings and the NFL even <strong>more economic sustainability</strong>. This means we will have our <strong>beloved Vikings to cheer on for decades to come.</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>We do not cheer fewer jobs for people of color,</strong> nor do we cheer language under section 17 sub 473j.121 of the <strong>stadium legislation that offers loopholes to avoid hiring people of color</strong>.  When recently asked at a recent public meeting to see work force participation numbers the MSFA could not (would not?)produce the numbers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>We encourage a forensic audit of the MSFA books</strong> now and ongoing, not after stadium completion. </p>
<p><strong>Fans are cheerin</strong>g the new stadium. <strong>The Wilfs are cheering </strong>on their private airplane back to NJ to their favorite bank and stadium-management company. </p>
<p><strong>Where are the cheering workers of color?</strong><br>

<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards <br>
  </em><em>featured in the weekly <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em><br>
and <a href="http://www.s/"><strong>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</strong></a> News Online </p>
<p><strong>In the early 90s, Minneapolis became known as &ldquo;Murderopolis</strong>.&nbsp; No wonder:&nbsp; <strong>by 1987</strong>, Minneapolis had the<strong> lowest number of sworn police officers since 1915</strong> and few Black officers. The Star Tribune confirmed this ongoing diversity scandal August 18, 2014, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/271772331.html"><strong>Minneapolis police struggle to hire diverse force</strong></a> (as we reported in our July 31, 2014 column). </p>
<p>A New York city newspaper headline two weeks ago should concern us all: &nbsp;<strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/bret-stephens-of-ferguson-and-fallujah-1408404679?KEYWORDS=Ferguson+and+Fallujah">Of Ferguson and Fallujah</a>, </strong>two disastrously reactive police forces.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Some people fear the police.&nbsp; Some police fear the p</strong>eople, especially Black people. &nbsp;<strong>Diversity is the key, for with diversity the pool of candidates is greatly increased</strong>, as well as police acceptance in the community. Minneapolis must stop attempting to decrease that pool and cease blocking diversity. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s look at the history: </p>
<p><strong>Total Police Officers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>1987:&nbsp; 704, lowest number since 1915.</li>
  <li>1997:&nbsp; 938 </li>
  <li>2014:&nbsp; 770 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total Black Police Officers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>1989:&nbsp; 28 </li>
  </ul>
  <li>2004:&nbsp; 50 </li>
  <li>2010:&nbsp; 68 </li>
  <li>2014:&nbsp; 68</li>
  <li>2014:&nbsp; 6% of Minneapolis police officers (not 12%) are Black, lower than the percentage in Ferguson, Missouri.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our police Chief has to head off this recruitment and hiring disaster.&nbsp;</strong> She is to reach the sworn personnel number of 860 by the end of this year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nightly news of <strong>Ferguson</strong>, Missouri and <strong>Falujah</strong>, Iraq have<strong> awakened people to the reality of what can happen when young people see no options, no hope, no jobs, no inclusion.</strong></p>
<p>From 2004-2008, the PCRC (Police Community Relations Council) working together with the DOJ (federal Department of Justice), gathered statistical data, analyzed it, and <strong>concluded that unless the MPD&rsquo;s Comprehensive Diversity Plan of June 2008 was followed and vigorously pursued, as signed off on by then Police Chief Nolan, Minneapolis would slip into dark days.</strong></p>
<p>This summer we have watched with shock and dismay how <strong>the Human Resources Department, under Ms. Patience Ferguson, continually violates the City Charter,</strong> working hand in hand with the Department of Civil Rights, <strong>purposefully withholding information from the police Chief and the Mayor regarding how the Comprehensive Diversity Plan of 2008 has collapsed.</strong> &nbsp;Once again, the African American community will be shut out, passed over, and denied equal opportunity, all under color of law.</p>
<p>I also <strong>alerted the head of the public safety committee</strong> of the collapse of the Comprehensive Diversity Plan and <strong>that information was also being withheld from his committee,</strong></p>
<p>John Delmonico, President of the Police Federation, warned that<strong> if the MPD&rsquo;s Comprehensive Diversity Plan is not engaged fully and with commitment, it would be harmful to the department and the city</strong>.</p>
<p>Channel 5 and the Star Tribune have begun to cover <strong>the diversity scandal</strong> and how the <strong>Comprehensive Diversity Plan has been gutted</strong>.&nbsp; Will the Mayor and City Council act?</p>
<p>Minneapolis would not be in this predicament had the Comprehensive Diversity Plan been followed, had John Delmonico been listened to, and had the alert I sent, as a former DOJ monitor, been listened to.&nbsp; Instead <strong>we report in this column the shameful failure to seek diversity.</strong></p>
<p>Our readers know we have written that <strong>diversity in the fire department is also in trouble.&nbsp;</strong> Fortunately, the Fire Chief has indicated to this former federal overseer that he is prepared to work on the problem.&nbsp; Will the Police Chief and the Mayor do the same?</p>
<p>Senior black fire fighters and police officers <strong>in St. Paul report the same impending disaster:&nbsp;</strong> <strong>&nbsp;disappearance of African Americans from the fire and police services.&nbsp; </strong>What a dark day for those who fought hard to make the police and fire departments reflective of the communities they are to protect and serve.</p>
<p><strong>Will the failure of Minneapolis and St. Paul to diversify lead to &ldquo;another Ferguson,&rdquo; this time in the Twin Cities?</strong></p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1434d0820" id="c1434d0820"></a>August, 20, 2014 #34: Ferguson, MO:&nbsp; An American Race Tragedy.&nbsp; Again.</strong><br>
  <strong>Conflicting versions with parallels to Minneapolis </strong></p>
<p>August 20, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s Note:&nbsp; </strong>this column was written August 12, 2014, 3 days after the shooting in order to meet submission deadline of August 13, for release later by publishing and posting August  20, 2014.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Pull quote:&nbsp; </strong>Ferguson: 67percent African American, six of percent of 53 member police department are Black.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Michael Brown, August 9, 2014</strong>.&nbsp; 18 years old, to start college in two days.&nbsp; Instead:&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>stopped by police</strong> while walking on a street of Ferguson, MO, suburb of St. Louis; <strong>shot and killed</strong>. &nbsp;Rioting, burning, and looting followed.&nbsp; 20 police cars burned.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;like a war zone.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>The police version so far differs greatly from community eye witnesses,</strong> suggesting blinded justice promising but unable to see how to delivering a police investigation with truth and transparency. &nbsp;&nbsp;Will the FBI and Federal Department of Justice be the same way? </p>
<p><strong>Community of Ferguson, MO eye witness accounts vs. Police version</strong>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Michael Brown      attempted to cooperate when stopped vs. assaulted officer. </li>
  <li>First shot while      Brown 35 feet away vs. in car struggle for the weapon.</li>
  <li>Social media      pictures of bruises and injuries vs. denial of bruises and injuries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parallels between Minneapolis, Ferguson and other cities</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Ferguson, August      9:&nbsp; Michael Brown shot dead, white      on black.</li>
  <li>Minneapolis:&nbsp; August 9:&nbsp; 9 citizens of color gunned down in a      nightclub, black on black (all expected to survive).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Ferguson:&nbsp; 67% African American.&nbsp; &nbsp;6% of 53 member Police Department are      Black</li>
  <li>Minneapolis:&nbsp; 5.2% African American.&nbsp; &nbsp;9% of 770 members of MPD are Black</li>
  <li>Tension between      police and African American communities continues, as young Black males become      an endangered species due to incarceration.</li>
  <li>Lots of false      concern from Ferguson&rsquo;s white mayor, white police chief, 4 of the 5 white      city council members. </li>
  <li>Media focuses on violence      while ignoring causes of violence.</li>
  <li>Sense of      hopelessness heightens sense that no one cares, leading to more Fergusons:&nbsp; think Watts in Los Angeles 49 years ago:      &nbsp;5 days of rioting, martial law, 34      deaths, and over 1,500 injured and wounded.</li>
  <li>Will the grand jury      indict?&nbsp; Will police be      automatically exoneration?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will      the FBI find evidence of civil rights violations? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thoughts regarding next steps:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Needed: &nbsp;Martin Luther King, Jr. level of moral      leadership in governments, churches, businesses, and communities.</li>
  <li>Promote &ldquo;Community      development&rdquo; not &ldquo;community containment.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Change default      response of police away from&nbsp;      &ldquo;reasonable fear&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-defense.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Change default      response of black gangs from&nbsp;      &ldquo;territory&rdquo; and &ldquo;retaliation&rdquo; to chamber of commerce types of      economic development enterprises for young men.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hope is seen in those of Ferguson attempting to follow a non-violent model:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>White and black      citizens marching side by side in collective protest.</li>
  <li>White and black      citizens attempting to integrate significant changes in attitudes,      policies and actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s at stake:&nbsp; either more or less Ferguson style violence, here and abroad.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Arab Spring of late      2010 led to today&rsquo;s violence in Ukraine-Crimea-Russia; Gaza-Israel; Africa.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>American urban      gangs and US &ndash; Mexican border violence slows adoption of democracy and      liberty concepts. </li>
  <li>50 years ago:&nbsp; working to end &ldquo;unequivocally immoral laws aimed at America's black      population.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Today:&nbsp; need to reawaken do-gooder governments,      churches and private do-gooder groups so they serve their communities, not      containment bureaucracies, as seen in this pathetic quote about Ferguson      and race:&nbsp; &ldquo;has wrestled with the issue for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Avoid Fergusons by      standing against injustice and for equal opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are so many citizens and office holders comfortable with violence?</strong> There is no &ldquo;safety&rdquo; in not respecting all life, regardless of color, a pre-requisite for a civilized society.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most disappointing: first Black president urging us to remember Michael Brown &ldquo;through reflection and understanding&rdquo; rather than through education, jobs, economic development, and rethinking police actions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We pray again for a black family whose child has been gunned down by police.&nbsp; Our prayers continue for the opening of the eyes of Black and White leadership world wide to see and work toward peace and prosperity for all, to end violence and establish stability in what should be the safest nation on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>August 13, 2014</p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Pull Quote: </strong>Is 34 percent minority participation goal being met?</p>
<p>As Vikings fly up and down the field in training camp, our <strong>City Council</strong> is <strong>concerned about birds flying into the Viking Stadium glass walls</strong>.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They were <strong>unconcerned about letting stadium tax dollars fly into the stadium walls</strong> <strong>without taxpayer required approval.</strong>&nbsp; They seem unconcerned about birds flying into blades of giant renewable energy wind mills.&nbsp; And they <strong>seem unconcerned as construction jobs, hours, and pay of minorities fly into the stadium glass wall of broken promises and statutes,</strong> just as done with new stadiums for the Gophers, Twins, and Wild. </p>
<p>As the city and state chose the architect and the contractor, isn&rsquo;t this their problem?&nbsp; Why are they not using the contingency &ndash; emergency funds of this $2 billion stadium?&nbsp; <strong>Why now the million dollar bird fix demand? What other non-agreement &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; await in the wings that the Vikings will be called on to pay if this precedent setting extortion works? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is this about birds or about those who are anti-stadium</strong>, <strong>anti</strong>-growth, <strong>anti</strong>-rich corporations, <strong>anti</strong> any change to the environment, or <strong>anti</strong> something else?&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Anyone see a stadium environmental study?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>And now that the Minneapolis Park Board refuses to bail out the <strong>People&rsquo;s Park to be out front of the stadium, who will be asked to pay for that?&nbsp;</strong> <strong>What else is being hidden from the public</strong> by the Sports Authority, ready to surface, expecting the Vikings and/or tax payers to pay?&nbsp; What other &ldquo;cooking of the books&rdquo; is going on? </p>
<p>The Star Tribune recently reported Polar Explorer Will Steger hired <strong>two</strong> <strong>Summit OIC (Opportunities Industrialization Center) graduates,</strong> a white female and a Black male.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steger&rsquo;s 25 year project in the North woods around Ely, MN, to create a conference center far from everyone, <strong>where the &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo; of the world can gather to think about how those not there should live, exposes the level of training of Summit OIC graduates.&nbsp; </strong>The article clearly suggests they aren&rsquo;t qualified for stadium construction work.&nbsp; How many Summit graduates are?</p>
<p><strong>Do they have licenses as Journeymen or Apprentices?&nbsp; </strong>What do their certificates of completion mean?&nbsp; Summit OIC claims they can &ldquo;take a person earning an average of $5,500 a year and after just 20 weeks of training start them at a job that will earn an average of $26,000 annually.&rdquo;&nbsp; How many Summit OIC graduates have actually done so?&nbsp; With 12% of whites and 26% of Blacks living in poverty in America today, <strong>how come Summit OIC grads are not being lifted out of poverty? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vikings stadium construction appears to be bypassing African Americans as was done Gophers, Twins, and Wild</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Where is the report</strong> on the numbers of hours worked by women and minorities on the Vikings stadium so far?&nbsp; The Sports Facility Authority indicated December 3rd, 2013, that, to meet its commitment, 32% of the hours worked on the stadium would indeed be by women and people of color (we asked that figures be broken down by women and people of color, and not be combined). </p>
<p><strong>32% of hours for women and people of color translates into close to a million and a half hours.</strong> <strong>Where is the report attesting to that?&nbsp; We are asking for verification.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>32% of hours, at an average salary of $27/hr, means an economic surge in the African American community.<strong> Where&rsquo;s that surge?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Where&rsquo;s the signed report?&nbsp; How many Summit graduates are employed at the stadium?</strong></p>
<p><strong>This column asks for the release of the certification of hours employed</strong> by the African American community and others of color on this stadium project.&nbsp; <strong>In what way is prosperity here again for the African American community?&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p><strong>Pullquote: </strong>How many seeking America&rsquo;s charter of liberty can get into &ldquo;lifeboat America&rdquo; before America sinks?<br>
  <br>
  For nearly 400 years, since 1620,<strong> the dark secret of American immigration has been its policies detrimental to Blacks</strong> (Black Africans, Black Cubans, Black Caribbeans). Most slaves to North America arrived through the Caribbean.</p>
<p><strong>We see this dark secret replayed given the contrasting treatment of Black children to that of the thousands of Latin children coming from Central American and Mexico, crossing the Rio Grande into America,</strong> with help from their countries and ours, leaving most things unchanged for immigrants from Black Africa, Black Cuba, and Black Caribbean. Thus, America has been confronted with the problem of immigration and race since its inception.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reactions to the voluntary child immigrants ranges from embarrassed and angry, to happy celebration,<strong> from seal the border, to</strong> <strong>take down the walls and fences and let in any who wants to come (Jimmy Carter urged the latter when he was president). The continuity is that again, others are leap frogged over Blacks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Central American countries and Mexico have offices established to provide papers for people to cross the Rio Grande to offices in the USA ready to receive them, as our federal government assigns them to different cities as they come in.</strong> Also taking advantage are Al-Queda members from the Middle East.<strong> How many seeking America&rsquo;s charter of liberty can get into &ldquo;lifeboat America&rdquo; before America sinks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black immigrant experience was involuntary: slavery, Jim Crow, and now continued discrimination under continued quota systems</strong> that discriminate by<strong> sawing off the rungs of the ladder of mobility</strong> and by<strong> installing a ceiling</strong>. Ask Black Haitians. Ask Black Cubans. Ask Black Africans.</p>
<p><strong>William Kunstler</strong>, the brilliant and sometimes radical civil rights attorney (mid 60s &ndash; mid 90s), stated that <strong>&ldquo;My purpose is to keep the state from becoming all-domineering, all powerful,&quot; especially over minorities.</strong> William Kuntsler, of a different mind, worked to end blocking those seeking an opportunity for a better life for American Blacks and for immigrants.</p>
<p><strong>In the mid-1960s, Harlem&rsquo;s Congressman Adam Clayton Powell exposed the secret quota system being run by the Immigration Service, blocking the entry of Blacks from around the world from entering the United States of America. <em>Ebony</em> magazine ran its landmark exposure article in 1971. There was no liberal outcry other than from a small group of Black Americans and an even smaller group of White liberals.</strong> Many Black Haitian and Black Cuban &ldquo;boat people&rdquo; drowned in the Caribbean as a result of America turning them away from America&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p><strong>Read the speeches printed into the Congressional Record by</strong> Harlem&rsquo;s Congressman <strong>Adam Clayton Powell, Jr</strong>., by Illinois Congressman <strong>William Dawson</strong>, by New York Congresswoman <strong>Shirley Chisholm</strong>, by Michigan Congressman <strong>John Conyers</strong>, and as continued by the <strong>Congressional Black Caucus today</strong>, as these issues remain unresolved.<strong> Black America has stood mostly alone in exposing this ongoing racially charged immigration policy.</strong></p>
<p>I remember the riots in the 1980s at the Atlanta federal penitentiary in Atlanta, GA, by Black Haitians and Black Cubans, some who had been held for over five years in federal detention with no charges made against them. <strong>It was that policy of holding people indefinitely without charge that evolved into the policies at our military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</strong></p>
<p><strong>White immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe, seen as kinsmen, are protected as Whites with White privilege.</strong> How different has been the experience of immigrants from Africa, from the very beginnings in America. They could not/can&rsquo;t invoke White privilege. <strong>America&rsquo;s purposeful race amnesia continues.</strong></p>
<p>America&rsquo;s dark history regarding Black immigration &ndash; pun intended &ndash; continues, as <strong>America continues to balk at discussing the issue of race with truthfulness and integrity.</strong></p>

  <strong>Pullquote:</strong> Liberals for the African American are, quite simply stated, &ldquo;regressive,&rdquo; using the twisted guise of &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; to continually make it difficult for African Americans and people of color to be treated fairly and equitably.<br>
  <br>
  The facts of the last 40 years reveal Minnesota is not, when it comes to African Americans, liberal and progressive. It is illiberal and regressive, openly and defiantly not complying with federal or local civil rights laws and rules, adopting purposeful amnesia to counter such inconvenient memories.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1972:</strong> the federal court in the State of Minnesota, <strong>imposed sanctions</strong> on the Minneapolis Fire Department and the City of Minneapolis for such violations.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1979:</strong> a request sent by this columnist, as chairman of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, to the federal court for a review of its 1972 decree. The court did so and <strong>imposed sanctions</strong> on the City of Minneapolis and its fire department, appointing a special federal oversight committee.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1989:</strong> based on the investigation by the court&rsquo;s oversight committee of continued violations, <strong>serious sanctions </strong>of $1 million were imposed on the City and its fire department and, thus, its tax payers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1989:</strong> the City of Minneapolis said it had learned its lesson and would comply and honor the requirements of the law --<strong> another lie</strong>. <strong>The City, comfortable in its violations of federal requirements </strong>for integrating its fire and police departments, despite occasional sanctions, has not employed any significant number of African Americans in the last two employment hires.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2000:</strong> the city agreed that the Civil Rights Department would monitor and undertake due diligence regarding compliance, and report and update the racial composition of the fire and police services. <strong>The Civil Rights Department has not made a report on this in 10 years</strong>, enabling continued undermining of African Americans in the fire and police services.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2014:</strong> two weeks ago, the fire department quietly <strong>hired 19</strong> new fire fighters; <strong>only one was a person of color</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2014:</strong> Three days ago, as of this July 22 column submission, the City of Minneapolis and its Human Resources Department, over the objections of the Police Federation under Lt. John Delmonico, finalized the next class of officers to be hired, bragging of hiring 30 percent people of color when, in reality, they <strong>again short changed people of color</strong>:<br>

  <br>
  While <strong>city government talks</strong> about equity, diversity, affirmative action and all of the other <strong>glossy liberal terms that are as meaningless as the vows by liberals t</strong>hat they will open the doors of opportunity, they <strong>used a new formula to enable Whites to pass over African Americans,</strong> moving African Americans toward becoming endangered species in the police and fire departments. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Liberals, for fellow Whites, are &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo; Liberals, for the African American are, quite simply stated, &ldquo;regressive,&rdquo;</strong> using the twisted guise of &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; to continually make it difficult for African Americans and people of color to be treated fairly and equitably.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Velma Korbel, director of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department</strong>, was notified that due diligence was needed. She declined to be diligent and <strong>declined to conduct the due diligence</strong> needed to offer protection and opportunity for the African American community and other people of color.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, <strong>my conclusion is this:</strong> it is time that the<strong> fire and police services again be placed under federal administration, and that the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department</strong>, another purposefully failing bureaucracy, <strong>be unceremoniously disbanded</strong>.<br>

  <br>
July 24, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>PULL QUOTE: </strong>The [civil rights] department has been a disaster through two directors and two mayors. </p>
<p><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2011/columns/11q3.htm#1139c0928" target="_blank">&ldquo;Murderopolis continues to flourish&rdquo;</a> was our column headline, September 26, 2011. We in Minneapolis, as Chicago, Indianapolis, and other cities, are <strong>at a crossroads: Choose between the protection and prosperity for the &ldquo;helping&rdquo; bureaucracies or protection and prosperity for those they were established to help? </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>More trillions for bureaus or for those the bureaus were created to help?</strong> <strong>&ldquo;Murderopolis?&rdquo;</strong> Minneapolis, Chicago, Indianapolis and other cities, <strong>or not Murderopolis?</strong><br>
  <br>
  As the nation&rsquo;s attention turns to violence involving guns in Minneapolis, Chicago and Indianapolis, among other cities, proportionality is seen: Each city is on par with the level of gun violence per capita. <strong>Why won&rsquo;t the violence go away? </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Common threads:<br>
  </strong><br>
  <strong>(1) illegal drugs</strong>, especially heroin, an evil driving terrorism in cities like Minneapolis;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>(2) </strong>a disturbing number of African American <strong>males confined to wheelchairs</strong> due to shootings and assaults; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>(3) attacks on police officers</strong> (Indianapolis police officers have been shot at 18 times this year by gunmen firing from ambush; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>(4) a reduction in the number of police</strong> officers and sheriffs needed; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>(5) continue spending of trillions to support the bureaucracies </strong>established to help people <strong>rather than spending it on helping people </strong>excel in education, jobs, and housing; and <br>
  <br>
  <strong>(6) all contributing to what seem like policies reflecting a calculated and intentional genocide. </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Murders are taking place by any means necessary,</strong> especially with guns and knives. <strong>Who gets protected?</strong> How about baseball? Minneapolis created <strong>&ldquo;clean zones&rdquo; (clean of Blacks) to protec</strong>t the city&rsquo;s $145 million windfall from hosting<strong> Major League Baseball&rsquo;s All Star Game July 15, </strong>demonstrating that communities considered valuable receive protection. <br>
  <br>
  One hundred police officers were borrowed from other jurisdictions to keep these zones &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; <strong>Communities not considered &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; do not receive such protection. </strong>This emerging debate in Chicago and Indianapolis has made their mayors extremely unpopular with the affected Black and Brown communities.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>We hear discussions about getting guns off the street but few about how guns got on the street.</strong> It was little discussed at the recent so-called law enforcement summit at the school district HQ in North Minneapolis. <br>
  <br>
  For over 30 years we&rsquo;ve asked:<strong> Are gun manufacturing plants located within affected communities? We know there are no Black people manufacturing weapons. </strong>There are no Black people with access to the materials needed to manufacture and market high-powered assault weapons and handguns. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>The African American community doesn&rsquo;t even have a business that manufactures knives.</strong> The <strong>economic surge</strong> in the area of weapons is <strong>for Whites</strong>. The <strong>violence surge</strong> in  caused by weapons<strong> is for Blacks.</strong><br>
  <br>
  This cycle of violence has<strong> a &ldquo;weapons highway&rdquo; between big Chicago and the little Chicagos like Minneapolis and Indianapolis</strong>. These modern trails of broken tears are from communities seeing their future destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  Minneapolis and Indianapolis have not yet reached the point of needing to deploy the National Guard. <strong>The African American community needs to be convinced that the system cares and that it has a solution for the preservation of African American lives, </strong>now and in the future. We do not enjoy being a doomsday predictor, but one homicide a week and numerous assaults is why we are.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Dreams are dying and fears are rising </strong>in Minneapolis, Chicago, and Indianapolis because of these patterns of violence, at the center of which are <strong>guns and drugs brought into our communities. </strong>We recall the 1985 speech by now-U.S. Congresswoman <strong>Maxine Waters</strong>. As a member of the California Assembly, she<strong> warned that this problem was rapidly approaching. <br>
  </strong><br>
  <strong>People didn&rsquo;t listen. People didn&rsquo;t believe</strong>. And now we see the <strong>consequences</strong> of a very calculated plan that<strong> threatens the very future of Blacks in America.<br>
  </strong><br>

  A weekly column by Ron Edwards <br>
  </em><em>featured in the weekly <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em><br>
and <a href="http://www.s/"><strong>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</strong></a> News Online </p>
<p>July 17, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Pull quote: </strong>Our children are being <strong>mis-educated, under educated, or not educated at all</strong>, as they are <strong>dismissed, betrayed and violated</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why do White and Black leaders assume the Black community has waved a white flag of submission?</strong> However, we do raise questions about what is being planned for us as if we had, as seen during the various &ldquo;summit&rdquo; decision meetings ((see my columns of<strong> May 1, 2014  (<a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2014/columns/14q2.htm#c1418d0501">Safe streets promoted for White baseball. Selective reporting keeps the true level of violence concealed</a></strong>), and <strong>May</strong>, <strong>15, 2014 #20 </strong>(<strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2014/columns/14q2.htm#c1420d0515">Gang summit in Minneapolis. Preparing for summer 2014</a></strong>). </p>
<p><strong>We are a community under siege: inadequate education, few jobs, no meaningful plans for the future</strong> beyond endless planning meetings of<strong> Black and White do-gooder talk leaders on how to continue obstructing our access to equality and opportunity</strong>, on how to <strong>set us aside</strong> to make room for others, of how to plan the kind of <strong>genocide/extinction &ldquo;round ups&rdquo; discussed at decision &ldquo;summits.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We celebrated our nation&rsquo;s independence July 4th. Frederick Douglass, arguably the most famous fugitive slave of his day, asked in a historic speech, July 5, 1852: <a href="http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/what-to-the-slave-is-the-fourth-of-july/" target="_blank"><strong>What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July</strong></a>? </p>
<p><strong>Douglass gave a ringing affirmation of America&rsquo;s ideals of freedom and liberty, left stalled and unfinished while slavery and racial discrimination existed.</strong> Being neither despairing (he was <strong>hopeful, due to the principles laid out by the founders in the Declaration and the Constitution that he saw as affirming the truth of liberty and equality) </strong>nor was he unduly negative (slavery was a fact and the slow pace of abolishing slavery was maddening).</p>
<p>The Minneapolis weekend of the July 4-6, certainty sent a chill through the very fiber of Minneapolis (nine shot, two killed, all within a period of 12 hours, Star Tribune, July 7, 2014 (<strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/266135821.html">Aggravated assaults rise in Minneapolis</a></strong>). Our columns referenced, of May 1 and 15, 2014, reported aboveon planning &ldquo;summits,&rdquo; which viewed only a small number of African Americans acceptable to the White and Black leadership. That was a shot across the bow of the Black community, exploding especially before our young and elderly, viewed as expendable.</p>
<p><strong>Why did the mayor and police chief think their July 9, 2014 walk on our streets would give our community under siege a sense of protection and leave behind equal opportunity? They came. They walked and talked. They left. Status quo neglect of community remained.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Black Americans did not slip into this country in the dead of night, or behind dark clouds of benign neglect, or by climbing over or crawling under fences.</strong> We have served this nation in war and peace, in growth and prosperity. We have shed our blood in the defense of our nation. And yet, today, in this city, we have the impression that Whites assume we are waving the white flag of surrender, that they can, unopposed, adopt policies of nullification and reversal as the appropriate order of the day. But we will be damned if we are to turn our backs and leave the struggle only half completed.</p>
<p><strong>Our obligation is to protect our freedom, our franchise, our future. Our children are being mis-educated, under educated, or not educated at all, as they are dismissed, betrayed and violated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission is not within our community and civil rights DNA. </strong>We sill continue to <strong>dream of being treated with respect and afforded equal opportunity</strong> based on the content of our character, not denied due to the color of our skin.</p>
<p><strong>We, the sons and daughters of the African, understand when there is a plan and mission afoot to marginalize us and remove us from the American scene, </strong>and, in this case, from the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. We who believe <strong>we are equal to all will not let attempts at genocide and extinction happen on our watch.</strong></p>
<p>May God save and protect our future and help prevent the flag of surrender from being forced upon us.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1428d0709" id="c1428d0709"></a>July, 09, 2014 #28: </strong><strong>A Civil Rights  and faith leader passes from the American scene</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards <br>
</em><em>featured in the weekly <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em><br>
and <a href="http://www.s/"><strong>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</strong></a> News Online </p>
<p>July 10, 2014</p>
<p>As  discussed last week, the Rev. Dr. Lillian Anthony was the first Director of the  Minneapolis Civil Rights Department, appointed in late 1967 by then Mayor  Arthur Naftalin. Dr. Anthony quietly passed from this life at her home in  Louisville, Kentucky, June 26, 2014. Her memorial will be in Louisville, July  11, 2014.</p>
<p>The  Rev. Dr. Anthony&rsquo;s history, legacy and accomplishments are legendary. <strong>She was  clearly the right choice to be the first Direxor of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department,</strong> setting a new tone for race relations in the city. She was not a woman to be  intimidated nor forced to abandon her principles and her commitment.</p>
<p>When  Lillian Anthony accepted the appointment as first to head the Minneapolis Civil  Rights Department, she was an experienced and successful civil rights activist  and administrator. On the occasion of her departure in an article in the <em>Minneapolis  Star</em>, dated May 29, 1969, she <strong>articulated her concerns about the future of  the city because of those who opposed having a Civil Rights Department and  Civil Rights Commission. </strong>That opposition still exists today. She and long-term  activist Josie Johnson formed a very close philosophical relationship that served  them well over their careers.</p>
<p><strong>I  remember the first time I met Ms. Anthony. </strong>I was about to <strong>become the vice chair  of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, at age 28.</strong> I have  been forever grateful for  her friendship, fellowship and over all support, which allowed an active Civil  Rights Department and Civil Rights Commission to make a difference carrying out  the direction and dream expressed by Mayor Arthur Naftalin in his historic  address to the Minneapolis City Council, June 30, 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Dr.  Anthony understood the principles of compassion and fairness.</strong> She knew the  importance of not forgetting our history. As she stated at the 10th  anniversary celebration of the Slave Memorial at Mount Vernon, VA, September  18, 1993,<strong> &ldquo;The memory of our ancestors who are buried here is a tribute not  only to the survival of a people but a tribute to our continued gifts to the  world.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Those  memories and their significance are missing today from the Minneapolis Black  leadership, as is their lack of commitment to the principles that created the  Civil Rights Department and commission. Let&rsquo;s not forget what the <em>Minneapolis  Star</em> article, July 31, 1964, in which the legendary Mary Kyle, publisher of  the <em>Twin City Courier</em>, and Ms. Josie Johnson, a member of the staff of  then-Mayor Arthur Naftolin, reflected on the dangerous path that was being  taken by women of truth and commitment in support of the missions of the Civil  Rights Department and commission.</p>
<p>Lillian  Anthony was ordained into the ministry of the Presbyterian Church USA, July 25,  1993. As noted, she served the national staff until retirement as Associate for  Affirmative Action and Equal Employment. History will remember Dr. Anthony as a  visionary, as a tenacious fighter for civil and human rights, and, for 40  years, a person of conscience on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, USA. She  was known across the wider Presbyterian Church USA her work during and for her  commitment to justice and advocacy.</p>
<p>She  was honored February 20, 1990, for her role in the development of he  Minneapolis Ordinance on Civil Rights and the Minneapolis Department of Civil  Rights.</p>
<p>The  Rev. Dr. Anthony has embarked on her final journey. We all pass this way once  in life. We look at her journey with pride, and remember her wisdom and  compassion that inspired others to take that journey as well. May God&rsquo;s hand be  upon Dr. Anthony&rsquo;s shoulders, and may we applaud her achievements in the name  of all.</p>

<p>This column provides a time line to further  understand our discussion of the failure of the Civil Rights Department and  Commission, including that of current director, Velma Korbel (hence our call in  last week&rsquo;s column, June 26, 2014, for her dismissal: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2014/columns/14q2.htm#c1426d0625"><strong>Velma Korbel  must go!

  <li>March 2003 &ndash; 2014: the investigative  journalism of these columns reports weekly on how the order of the day is to still  embrace the nullification and reversal of Arthur Naftalin&rsquo;s vision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That  vision has been undermined by Velma Korbel, certain predecessors, and those who  support ongoing violations of the civil rights philosophy we have long fought to  follow: to make a difference by working for social justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We  still need a museum for remembrance</strong>, as the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/23/living/atlanta-civil-rights-museum/index.html?hpt=hp_c2" target="_blank">recently  opened musem in Atlanta</a>. If the history of our struggle is not remembered,  it didn&rsquo;t exist. If it is not understood, it won&rsquo;t be ended. As a member of the  board of directors of the <strong><a href="http://www.blackmuseums.org/" target="_blank">Association of African American Museums</a></strong> recently stated, &ldquo;We're going backward, not forward with the civil rights  movement. &hellip; The whole future of this country is for different communities who  care about social justice to get together, and work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s  make a positive difference in education, jobs, and housing.</strong> Remember the  question above: &ldquo;Is non violence wearing thin?&rdquo; <strong>Non-violence wears thin when the cause of social justice has worn even  thinner.</strong></p>
<p> Stay tuned. </p>
