<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>-----BREAKING&nbsp; NEWS RE SALE OF KMOJ-----</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>LAST BLACK CONTROLLED RADIO STATION<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN MINNESOTA, KMOJ,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>TO BE SOLD TO WHITES.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>WHY?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY NOT SELL TO BLACK CAPITAL</strong><strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>FOR BLACK COMMUNITY WEALTH BUILDING?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>December 16, 2016<br>
  <br>
$2.1 million has been offered by the Hubbard Foundation to buy the Public Broadcasting station KMOJ, whose radio antennae is controlled through the Hubard Foundation.</p>
<p>KMOJ is the only African American radio station In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis &ndash; St Paul area. &nbsp;The final Plan is to be finalized by February 1st, 2017.</p>
<p>$2.1 million should be considered an insult, or from a business standpoint, illadvised. The Black owners should have stepped up to offer the sale to Black capital.&nbsp; A Black media platform could have been built centered on Blacks.&nbsp; KMOJ is one of the last of the commercial non-profit radio stations in the United States.&nbsp; Minneapolis Blacks have a network of Black athletes and Black entertainers? Many are recognnizing taht sustaned revenue is best, and even better is sustaining revenue through profitable job creationg&nbsp; </p>
<p>But once again, so-called Black leaders act to enrich themselves as the expense ofte community, just as the NAACP did with the Holman Project and the Urban League did with its property.&nbsp; Lots of talk about black economic development while steps are taken to block it or reduce it, with &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; enriced at the expense of the Community, as we outlined in our 2002 book, <em>The Minneapolis Story</em>, and in many columns and blogs since 2003.</p>
<p>It is our urgent wish that we would be contacted before Black enterprises are sold to white buyers.&nbsp; How do we build up Black wealth if we keep selling assets to whites for their wealth building?&nbsp; </p>
<p>COMING SOON:&nbsp;&nbsp; a list of our columns, blogs and  book chapters that have dealt with this since 2002, will be compiled and posted in the Solutions section of this web site.&nbsp; May they inspire future dealings to be in the best interest of our community.</p>
