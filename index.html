      <p><strong><a name="c1923EdNote" id="c1923EdNote"></a>Editor's Note </strong></p>
<p>Ron died  January 2020. His column appeared in the oldest continuing Black newspaper in  Minnesota, <a href="https://spokesman-recorder.com/"><strong><em>The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</em></strong></a>, for 17 years, 2003 &ndash;  2019. (His web site includes his columns, his blog entries, and his solution  papers.) He also hosted long running TV programs and a world-wide blog radio  program, co-hosted with Don Allen.</p>
      <p>The  Minneapolis Story was the brain child of Dennis Green, former NFL Coach of the  Minnesota Vikings, and later Head Coach of the NFL Arizona Cardinals and UFL  Sacramento Mountain Lions. He shared Ron's vision of "equal  access and equal opportunity" for all, and need to expose the blocking of "equal access and equal opportunity" by both sets of  leadership," Black ones and White ones, separately and together.</p>
      <p>Following Ron's inaugural  column of March 26, 2003, are the columns for 2019. His columns and blog  entries for 2003 - 2019, are in his <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocarchives.htm">Archives</a>.</p>
      <p>One of Ron's last  considerations for a column was to be based on this &quot;What Changed?&quot;  question raised at the end of 2019 in The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>In the 1960's</strong></li>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>40% of Black had their own        business</li>
          <li>87% of Black families were        two-parent</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>TODAY:</strong></li>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>Less than 7% of Blacks own        businesses</li>
          <li>Only 25% of Black families are        two-parent</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>When asked in mid-June what is the greater problem for the  communities of color, white racism or the absence of dads in black families,<strong> Kweisi  Mfume</strong>, former head of the national NAACP replied without missing a beat that  the biggest problem without question is the absence of fathers in the home, a  topic which has also been  a long term concern of Ron Edwards.<br>
        <br>
        Ron's goal was to  reaffirm the relevance and importance of his two books as well as his  website, his column archive of 17 years, and his blog entries. These  words speak volumes regarding not only the continued relevance of Ron's books,  website, and columns, but also their continued urgency, for he never  took his eyes off the prize of liberty's freedom and equality and the  opportunities for economic development and  community and personal  prosperity.      </p>

        Pelosi: President in 2020? </strong>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>If / when the US House of  Representatives' "Impeachment Inquiry" leads to "Articles of Impeachment,"  President Trump will go on trial in the US Senate. If convicted he would be  removed from office (also if he resigns, is incapacitated, or dies). The  Constitution then provides for the Vice President, Mike Pence, to be President,  unless he too leaves office for any of the same reasons. The Constitution then  provides for the third in line, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,  Nancy Pelosi, to be a temporary care taker President during 2020.</p>
      <p>It is no accident that highly  paid mainstream media talking heads avoid reporting this constitutional succession  chess game. When Bob Mueller was appointed to investigate the dark corridors of  power behind the 2016 election, the anti-Trumpers believed his report would  unleash their master plan to remove Trump, a campaign started after Trump's  election and before Trump's swearing in.</p>
      <p>Regardless of outcomes, all  voters, for and against Trump, are being sucker-punched by the impeachment  proceedings leading to the fog of constitutional crisis and disaster.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure: I carry no  water for political parties, only for citizens left behind, regardless of color  or party, especially those in minority communities, which my sense tells me  will be the big losers (see my November 9, 2018 column, <em>"A Nation Dangerously Divided</em>,", and my July 2019 columns of July  11 (<em>America is angry on the 4th  of July), </em>and July 28 (<em>The race card played in Baltimore and America's  cities</em>). </p>
      <p>I am not a Republican. I am  inclined to still follow the Democratic party's path, as I have since 1960,  when I first became eligible to vote.</p>
      <p>The searching for "smoking  guns" to justify impeaching Trump continue. The same "facts" remain, with half  of the voters interpreting the "evidence" one way: Trump is "guilty," and the  other half interpreting the same evidence the opposite way: Trump is "not guilty."</p>
      <p>Few seem to grasp that  regardless of who wins or loses, neither party will be able to return the  country to the way it was, setting up potential impeachment attempts after  2020's election.</p>
      <p>Impeachment scars and cripples  elections, regardless of party, risking turning our Republic into a  Parliamentary system, where a mere "vote of no confidence" will be all that is  necessary to remove a President on any day, at any time, from Inauguration Day  on.</p>
      <p>This impeachment farce is  turning into a governing tragedy. If Trump is impeached, Pence, who was on the  call with the head of The Ukraine would also be impeached, resulting in Nancy  Pelosi becoming a temporary caretaker President for the remainder of 2020.</p>
      <p>If the "destroy Trump" project  backfires, Congress will be jumping off of a high Constitutional diving board  into a pool with a cement bottom but no water, as one side "interprets" the  "facts" as impeachable and the other side interprets the same "facts" as not  impeachable.</p>
      <p>What happens once the blood of impeaching  is tasted? In my November 9, 2018 column, I wrote that "too many on both sides of the  political aisle and at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue feel we are beyond the  ability to honestly work for national healing." If we think we can't, we won't. But  if we think we can, we will. Let's not divide and weaken our nation domestically  and internationally.</p>
      <p>My prayers are for a united Republic,  and for the well-being of the sons and daughters who fight and die for us,  overseas and on our city streets. I offer prayers for America to be united,  that we might live by Lincoln's March 4, 1865, Second Inaugural vision, 41 days before his  assassination, that we live<strong> </strong>"with malice toward none, with charity for all."</p>

        The Nation and Minnesota: equally divided </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Our Great American Impeachment  play, like those of Shakespeare's plays about mad kings (Lear and Richard II)  continues (see my October 17, 2019 column).</p>
      <p>A poll two weeks ago showed  that the Twin Cities and the state of Minnesota reflect a near equal response  about impeachment: 48% for impeaching Trump, 47% for not impeaching Trump, 5%  with no opinion. A national poll by Georgetown University discovered that 67% believe the nation is nearing civil war, </p>
      <p>Mad President or not, it is  maddening that the news is filled with this impeachment play instead of the  tragic plays in our cities and neighborhoods, especially our inner cities, as  vital topics are shoved aside and not addressed (education, employment,  housing, gentrification, health care, poverty, safety, immigration, and the  mental health and drug addiction issues of the homeless). Whether led by whites  or blacks, too many cities are not doing well (see my column of October 9,  2019).</p>
      <p>Democratic Representative Al  Green has said impeachment is imperative as Trump will win re-election if he  isn't convicted of Impeachment charges. What is an impeachable offense? Democratic  Representative Maxine Waters in February 2017, and former Republican  representative Gerald Ford 20 years earlier said it is anything the House of  Representatives says is.</p>
      <p>Shakespeare used the word  "impeachment" in two ways: to "hinder", and to "accuse". The House is using it  in both senses, inquiring into accusations that Trump is hindering the United  States. If impeachment passes in the House, the Senate would hold a trial. If  convicted, Trump would be removed from office. If not convicted, Trump remains  in office. Regardless, Republicans want to retain power, Democrats want to get  power back.</p>
      <p>As of two weeks ago, the House  was concentrating on two offenses: the Trump phone call to the Ukraine  President (claiming a favor was requested in exchange for a favor), and Trump  pulling our armed forces out of the Kurdish part of Syria (with the debate being  between the charge of abandoning an ally vs. "end endless wars").</p>
      <p>The American Vice President and  the President of Turkey negotiated a cease fire, a "pause," for five days, to  allow the Kurds to leave Turkey for a safe zone in Syria. The Syrian Kurds, told  to negotiate their future, did so, with Syria, Turkey and Russia. Has America  lost her reputation as an honest broker for peace among nations? Were Trump and  the Vice President duped into betraying the Kurds, allowing Syria, Turkey and  Russia to become the new masters of the Middle east? Is Trump crazy, creating a  Great Disaster, or is he cleverly negotiating a peace settlement?</p>
      <p>As we said in our October 17,  2019 column, this looks like a great travesty in the American experience of  governing. We hope we are wrong, but for now it sadly looks as if the  institutions of American democracy are disintegrating, collapsing before our  very eyes, exposing America to the watching world that wonders if we are no  longer the world's prime defender of democracy.</p>
      <p>The experts say impeachment  depends upon a high percentage of public opinion wanting it. Will Americans  view Donald Trump and, by extension, the Republican party, as no longer advocating  for democracy? Many wanted to impeach our 44th president, Barach  Obama. In the future, will endless impeachment attempts be started by losers as  the "new normal" on any future inauguration day?</p>
      <p>Republicans, either temporarily  or for good, are slowly joining the call for impeachment. Will that continue? Both  parties are responsible for our nation being divided and torn apart. We all  need to remember Lincoln's use of a slogan from our Revolutionary War: "united  we stand, divided we fall." We must seek to unite together, so we can again  join Ray Charles in singing "American the Beautiful?"</p>
      <p>God bless America.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1920d1024" id="c1920d1024"></a>October, 24, 2019 #20: Impeachment. A Nation Divided</strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>The United States of America is  clearly divided. Will one of the key Constitutional checks and balance procedures  that is now in play, Impeachment, heal or increase the division? Will the  gamble pay off to remove Donald Trump, 45th president of the United  States from office or so wound him he won't be re-elected in 2020, or will it  act back on the gamble and help re-elect him?</p>
      <p>I will be following this  closely with a series of columns, especially in terms of how  Impeachment will impact Thurgood Marshall's defense of the First Amendment to  support the goals of reversing the ill-considered laws that still remain that  support racism and segregation in American institutions, governments, and  neighborhoods. What will impeachment do for the continuing or lessening of  violence in Black neighborhoods? How about regarding Education? Jobs? Wages? Health  care? </p>
      <p>Is this high stakes "impeachment  inquiry" gamble dumb or brilliant? While there have been demands for the  impeachment of most presidents, it has reached the level of taking action only four  times. Two presidents were actually impeached, Andrew Johnson in 1867 and Bill  Clinton in 1998, but both were acquitted by the US Senate and not removed from  office. Richard Nixon had Articles of Impeachment filed, but resigned in 1974  before the debate in the House began.</p>
      <p>Impeaching Johnson, Nixon and  Clinton had bipartisan support. So far, there is no bi-partisan support in the  Senate or in public opinion polls, to impeach Trump. Impeachment is a political  move, and is, as Gerald Ford stated regarding Nixon, "anything Congress says it  is."</p>
      <p>The actions of current members  of the House of Representatives remind me of a group of nursery school  children. A lot of bluster. A lot of subpoenas. A lot of committee meetings.</p>
      <p>According to the leadership of  the Democratic Party, the Impeachment Inquiry will become Articles of Impeachment  by Thanksgiving 2019. Unfortunately for the majority of Americans, no matter  how educated they think they are, they do not understand the arduous task of  preparing Articles of Impeachment, getting them passed, and then obtaining  conviction in the Senate for removal.</p>
      <p>If there is a Senate trial of  President Trump, it will be presided over by the Chief Justice of the United  States Supreme Court. The prosecutors (called managers), will be members of the  Democratic Party controlled House of Representatives, who must make their  arguments before their congressional members in the United States Senate.</p>
      <p>People would be well advised to  read and study the trial documents of the two failed attempts, the one to  convict Andrew Johnson in the 19th century and Clinton in the 20th  century, for insights regarding impeaching Trump in the 21st  century.</p>
      <p>These 21st century  impeachment proceedings will do wonders for television ratings. People will be  glued to their various screens and radios. Note that the Senate majority leader  can suspend the proceedings until a later date at any time, under the rules  which would be drafted by the Senate majority (Republicans).</p>
      <p>This will be quite a show, in  all of its televised and Internet glory. But it won't be easy to remove Trump  from office. We are on a dangerous road. How will America, a truly divided  nation at war with itself, heal itself?</p>
      <p>Democratic leaders, after the Mueller  report exonerated the collusion charge against Trump, now feel the "whistle  blower" complaint will enable a successful impeachment that will change the  course of American history. But in what way? How will both sides, in Trump's  words, use being "locked and loaded? Will their ambitious quest for recognition  and glory serve the best interests of the republic?</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1919d0923" id="c1919d0923"></a>September, 23, 2019 #19: Denial of service leads to Black infant's death</strong>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Six weeks ago, a young  mother raced her nine-month-old child to Children's Hospital in South  Minneapolis. Three weeks later, with her child showing symptoms of pneumonia,  the mother returned her baby to Children's Hospital. X-rays were taken. Staff  confirmed the child had advanced pneumonia.</p>
      <p>But according to the  evidence that has been gathered, the child was turned away  and, having received none of the required medical examination protocols to  attempt to preserve its life, died shortly thereafter. Let's hope the baby's  family's eventual lawsuit fares better with the justice system than did the  Jamar Clark family.</p>
      <p>What is a "protocol"? Most companies, agencies, and especially hospitals  and clinics must follow federal and state codes or protocols regarding medical  procedures ("compliance," "rules of conduct," "regulations," etc.). When not  followed, a protocol can become, to borrow a novel's title, a "Protocol of a  Damnation."</p>
      <p>Our question is simple, based on evidence and discussions: Why weren't  the healing protocols followed? The baby needed medicine, but confusion at the  hospital regarding insurance resulted in the hospital not filling the  prescription. So the young mother went to Walgreens, where confusion over  eligibility to receive medication again resulted in another denial of  lifesaving medicine for her baby. Within two hours of returning home without  the medicine, the baby died.</p>
      <p>The funeral was held. The baby was cremated. If not for the efforts of  Brooks Funeral Home, the child could not have had the funeral due to the cost  being beyond the reach of the mother and her family. I talked about this on my  worldwide radio program.</p>
      <p>How will the legal system respond? Already attorneys are in place  seeking justice. But studying Minnesota law and reflecting on hospital legal  documents can still leave the result in question. If you are assigned to the  general wing of the hospital, the chances are that you will not be afforded  medical care &mdash; sad news for children of color in Minneapolis and America.</p>
      <p>We all realize that America's healthcare system is broken and needs  fixing. And, we know that part of the fracturing of the healthcare system is  driven by forces denying equal care due to various reasons, including race and  poverty. Denial of service is harmful and thus does not meet the Hypocritic  Oath of "Do no harm."</p>
      <p>The debate is over who pays and how. The eligibility question is about  when race and poverty will be taken out of the equation. </p>
      <p>Over the past 16 years of this column, I have often written about how  medical care becomes selective, which is an abandonment of the goal of  providing medical care for all. So, when I received a request to again write of  this in terms of the nine-month-old baby, I saw an opportunity to again examine  the systematic medical malpractice against the interests and safety of persons  of color.</p>
      <p>The tragic death of this nine-month-old reminds us of how prevalent  medical malfeasance can become. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled  that The ACA (Affordable Care Act, or "Obama Care") is constitutional. That is  now being challenged in a court that says part of ACA is "unconstitutional and  inseverable," which therefore invalidates the whole Act.</p>
      <p>So now, it's not "if" but "when" health care is fixed, including  coverage of catastrophic medical expenses for all. Since 1912, seven presidents  (Republican/Progressive Teddy Roosevelt was the first) have tried to pass  healthcare legislation (three Republicans and four Democrats). </p>
      <p>Nixon proposed it, but the Democrats said no. Carter proposed it, but  Ted Kennedy said "Hold it" until he was president. So far we only have  Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.</p>

        Once again: what is just and fair? </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Federal  Judge Michael Davis' order for a fair-negotiation between the City of  Minneapolis and the family of the late Jamar Clark, stunned the city council  and the legal community as he requested a re-examination of all circumstances  involving Jamar Clark's November 2015, death by officer involved shooting, of  how the Clark family was delayed decisions for a year, and then offered nothing,  while Justine Damond's white family was given $20 million to the black Clark  family offer of only $200,000?</p>
      <p>Council  member Cunningham asked why the compensation offer to the Clarks was only $200,000  for the death of their son when the offer to the Damonds was $20 million for  the death of their daughter. Why such obviously unjust, unfair, and unequal  decisions? To deal with this, Judge Davis summoned City officials to appear  before him, to explain on the record, about their prior actions of withdrawing  the offer to the Clark family, and then finally offering a far lower figure.</p>
      <p>The  unfairness was compounded by the City's General Counsel, Susan Siegal, who  intentionally mislead the Clark family during the discussions that were drawn  out for over a year. In addition to this, was the questionable conduct by the  county attorney regarding Jerome Copeland, one of the most important  eyewitnesses to the Clark death. They made Copeland disappear on trumped up  charges trying to discredit him.</p>
      <p>It was  clearly this pattern of mis-conduct by Minneapolis City officials that did not  sit well with Judge Davis, who, as an African American, clearly recognized the  pain and the insult that had been imposed on this African American family in  what was clearly a fake intention to negotiate in good faith while only  negotiating intentionally with the Damond family.</p>
      <p>We  applaud a surviving sister of Mr. Clark, who stood tall, spoke with passion,  and clearly laid out the facts regarding the circumstances of dishonesty by the  City of Minneapolis regarding<strong> </strong>Clark were  done with malice aforethought. This is a fragile time for the city of Minneapolis  and its leadership regarding its credibility with the African American  community.</p>
      <p>The investigation  is tainted. We call your attention to six prior columns since the 2016 Clark  killing, which identified efforts by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to  suppress and obstruct evidence that would have brought forward fruitful  observations of what happened on that tragedy that November 2016.</p>
      <p>See my  MSR articles on the Clark affair dated November 24, 2015, January 27, 2016, March 2, 2016, March 23,  2015 April 6, 2016, and April 20, 2016.</p>
      <p>The hero of  this story is Judge Michael Davis, who understands the quest for Justice and  the search for compassion and honesty.</p>
      <p>Constitutionalists  should be concerned about the ethics and conduct of City Officials regarding  how they negotiated and obstructed justice.</p>
      <p>Clearly  no true foundation was laid for balancing justice and fairness for Jamar Clark.  How staggering, in light of the $20 million for the Damund family, with only  $200,000 was designated for the Clark family. Judge Davis recognized how  fairness and justice was betrayed. How unfair to have a former BCA agent  suggest that the Clark family should be happy and satisfied with $200,000 when  the Damond family was getting $20 million to the Australian family of Justine.</p>
      <p>These  numbers were based on previous payments and compensation in similar cases dealing  with the police. This has been a dangerous and slippery slope, as our refusal  to enjoin African Americans fairly and justly on race, fairness and justice for  all, as if there are those for whom the importance of their lives is not  important.</p>
      <p>We owe fairness  and justice to Jamar Clark and his family. God bless them and may they find  satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Stay  tuned</p>
      <p>We need to again listen to Martin  Luther King, Jr.'s call to non-violence, and his urging that we judge by  content of character and not color of skin. We need to adopt Barack Obama's  vision that we are Americans first, not separate as white, black, brown or  yellow Americans.</p>

      <p>We are experiencing a clash  of giants: the Civil Rights uniter, Elijah Cummings, and the divider President,  Donald Trump. We need the spirit of another giant, Thurgood Marshall, who was raised on the West Side of Baltimore, and whose <a href="https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2017/8/7/justice-for-all-50-years-after-thurgood-marshall-supreme-court-confirmation"><strong>legacy</strong></a><strong> </strong>is  clear: the "greatest civil rights lawyer and  constitutional lawyer of the twentieth century," who fought for equality for all, majority and minority,  "regardless of race or gender or circumstance, defending any individual or minority group  oppressed by the majority or by the government."</p>
      <p>I am upset about the tone  of President Trump's twitter storms against Baltimore and Congressman Cummings.  Nonetheless, this clash pulls the covers back on harsh facts both parties have  long avoided, blaming each other instead. Here are facts:</p>

Mexico (15), Brazil (14), Venezuela (5), Honduras  (3), Columbia (2), South Africa (2), and one each in El Salvador and Guatemala.</li>
        <li>HBO's "<a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-wire" target="_blank"><strong>The Wire</strong></a><strong>,</strong>" was about  West Baltimore.

      <p>Baltimore has been dubbed the &quot;most  dangerous city&quot; in Maryland. That's according to the financial news and  opinion site 24/7 Wall St., which dug into FBI data from 2017 to determine  violent crime rates in nearly 2,000 cities and towns.</p>

      <p>President Trump continues  from earlier attacks, as when he said that Barack Obama was born in a grass hut  in Kenya, Africa, an accusation and insult of a birther.</p>
      <p>These are troubling times,  dangerous times, as too many refuse to listen to such great voices as JFK (moon  vision), LBJ (Great Society vision), MLK, Jr (non-violence vision), Nellie  Stone Johnson (activist vision), Thurgood Marshall (equal vision), and others,  visions of Americans of all colors and persuasions rallying around and standing  together, equally proud of each other and our nation.</p>
      <p>The political decisions  fracturing respect and civility, has us teetering as if on the head of the  Statue of Liberty, casting shadows on the Washington Monument and the Lincoln  Memorial. We need instead to remind ourselves of the words and spirit of such  patriotic songs as "America the Beautiful."</p>
      <p>The race card will not  serve any who use it in 2019 and 2020. We need to stand up for our country, our  cities, and each other.</p>

      <p>"&hellip;..segregated West  Baltimore&mdash;a Harlem-like mecca of political activism, achievement, and black  culture (Marshall went to school with Cab Calloway)&mdash;that Marshall's worldview  took shape. For decades, national civil-rights leaders, including Marshall's  friend Clarence Mitchell Jr., the NAACP's chief lobbyist in Washington during  the 1960s, would rise from West Baltimore, which had been home to the  forerunner of the NAACP, the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty, and then  home to one of the strongest branches of the NAACP."</p>
      <p>"Traveling nearly 50,000 miles each year, mostly by  train, often alone, his life threatened too many times to count, Marshall took  Jim Crow apart plank by plank, state by state, federal ruling by federal  ruling. Overseeing hundreds of cases as director of the NAACP Legal Defense  Fund for 21 years, Marshall set precedent after precedent, not just in the  arenas of education and criminal law, but across every sector of public  life&mdash;voting, housing, transportation, equal pay, taxpayer-funded services,  military justice, higher education, and the rights of minorities to serve on  juries."</p>
      <p>"Three examples: Marshall helped establish that  coerced confessions are not admissible in court; that states cannot legally  enforce restrictions on the sale of homes to minorities; and that nonwhites  cannot be barred from voting in primary elections, which, in many parts of the  country, were the only votes that mattered."</p>
      <p>Marshall, called  the "dismantler of Jim Crow," enabled the striking of the death knell for  the USA legal apartheid system of "separate but equal." He pursued laws that  responded to "all are created equal," by which he meant "getting  the same thing, at the same time, and in the same place," for "any individual or minority group oppressed by the  majority or by the government, and that included women, the physically  challenged, and criminal defendants."</p>
      <p>&hellip;"Marshall&mdash;as courageous, tenacious, and visionary  an individual as this country has ever produced&mdash;changed America." </p>
      <p>"In the courtroom,  he made his case with facts, the law, and the Constitution in a frank manner,  neither alienating juries, Southern judges, nor opposing counsels, with whom he  generally got along. </p>
      <p>"Because  separate but equal facilities had never truly been accomplished&mdash;public services  for blacks were uniformly inferior&mdash;the only solution, Marshall began to argue,  was to make all public facilities and services open to all races."</p>
      <p>"When asked during  the Brown arguments by Justice Felix Frankfurter what he meant by "equal," Marshall  responded in the same forthright, plainspoken manner that had become his  hallmark.</p>
      <p>It is a  footnote in history that Johnson was so intent on appointing the first black  justice he created an opening on the court by naming Ramsay Clark attorney  general in early 1967. That move essentially forced his father, Supreme Court  justice Tom Clark, to resign because of a conflict of interest."</p>

      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>As the level of gun violence in the twin cities of Minneapolis and  St. Paul, continues to escalate, we see no real attempts to follow any of many  solutions proposed. The MSR last week had an article on fathers needing to talk  to their sons. Jamil Jivana has recently written <em>Why Young Men, </em>about solutions to combat the rise in  violence committed by young men around the world (all colors), </p>
      <p>On Friday, July 12, 2019, gunmen walked into the upscale, CRAVE roof  top restaurant dat Hennepinn Avenue and 8th Street, in the heart of  down town Minneapolis. Its was the latest violence in our city. Minneapolis Mayor  Jacob Frey and Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo say they have a plan. As of the writing of  this column we are still waiting for the unveiling of their plan.</p>
      <p>Gunfire has become a a new normal most nights and days, as we  reported in recent columns (<em>A city under  siege</em>, 6-20-19; <em>A Paralyzed Nation Prepares  for 2020, </em>6-27-19; <em>How long will rage  be the order of the day?</em><strong> </strong>July  11, 2019,). Our sister city of St. Paul, the state capital of Minnesota, is not  far behind us in violence and mayhem.</p>
      <p>The violence early Saturday morning, July 13, in down town  Minneapolis, reflects a dangerous pattern of planning and implementing  violence. The rioting and confrontation between party goers and law enforcement  frightened both citizens and visitors to downtown Minneapolis. The same weekend , 20,000 young people from 13 countries of the  Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, were holding a youth faith gathering at Vikings  stadium.</p>
      <p>I have warned about this. Predictions of both what is hoped for  and what is hoped to be avoided reflect a decade of what some call the "new  normal," which means leadership (community, government, corporate, profits and  non-profits, TV, radio and print) step away from this violence as "normal"  reflects the decision to not recognize the homicidal mentality as "this too  shall pass," that this violence will  subside, until, of course, the next time this now "normal" cycle circles back.</p>
      <p>It was interesting to hear the comments of some who were  interviewed by TV, cable, radio and print reporters and journalists, many  offering a shell-shocked reflection of concern and fear of the "new normal"  they have just lived through. The event caused panic up high, on the upscale  roof top restaurant, as well as down on city streets, as leadership once again  looked the other way, as if the carnage and chaos that erupted in the Twin  Cities and surrounding metropolitan areas will self-contain and self-remove.</p>
      <p>Belief in the "new normal" prevents confronting the truth of a  city's violence that too often reminds us of TV and movie westerns of the wild  west's changing "normals," as seen in such famous wild west place names as  Northfield, Tombstone, Abilene, and Dodge City, including the famous outlaw  criminals in early 20th century St. Paul.</p>
      <p>Then the shootings are gone. Until, of course, the next time. For  some, being startled beyond anything imaginable showed up as a temporary  interruption of what was to have been a beautiful rooftop experience of a great  evening and what had bee n assumed to be a safe activity to enjoy.</p>
      <p>It is a sad commentary when Minneapolis sounds like a movie based  on a violent novel of a distant past. Where are the touted solutions, or is  their missing also part of the "new normal?"</p>
      <p>A long wondered question: why has no organization, agency, person  or leader asked about the solutions suggested in my 2002 book, my 16 years of  columns since 2003, and the over 50 solutions on my Minneapolis Story web site?</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1915d0711" id="c1915d0711"></a>July, 11, 2019 #15: America is angry on the 4th of July.
        How long will rage be the order of the day? </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>We don't need future historians to  look back to see what we already know, that on this 2019 fourth of July,  America is a split nation, and therefore a dangerous nation, as the debate  continues whether to heed Lincoln's prophetic words of "united we stand,  divided we fall." Will we go forward with "malice toward none" or pay, again in  Lincoln's words, the "full measure" of "lives and treasure" if we continue with  malice?</p>
      <p>How will future historians interpret  our split of each half hating the other half? Will they record we took the  dangerous, grim path of the French Revolution's "by any means necessary," or  that we took the path of hope born of being thankful for America and work  instead to heal the split and not make it wider?</p>
      <p>Will future historians speak of us, as  was spoken about the early 20th century civil war in Spain, the  chilling words that the modern Spain that emerged "has nothing to do with what  either side fought and died for." At least the USA ended slavery and  segregation and set us on the path of our yet unfinished project of fully  legalizing civil rights, unfinished due to violence against each other and  remaining legal barriers. How will they say we handled such shootings as those  in Minneapolis and St. Paul the Thursday and Friday before the 4th  of July celebrations?</p>
      <p>As of the crafting of this column, the  top of community and government leadership, profit and non-profit leadership,  have too often been silent. In some areas of the Twin Cities, such as the East  side of St Paul and the North side of Minneapolis, people talk about sleeping  in their bathtubs because of the death and injury potential of spraying bullets  bringing death and injury.</p>
      <p>We ask again, what is the anger that  seems to be driving violence in America on this 4th of July? The  Star Tribune, the Sunday before the 4th of July, highlighted  statements of Minnesota's Attorney General, Keith Ellison, who talked about the  hatred that is poisoning rural Minnesota, as if such hatred is new? It isn't  new. The AG knows that for the 12 years he represented the 5th  Congressional District, the 5th was long a hotbed of casualties and violence.</p>
      <p>The article in the Star Tribune is an  exception to the usual silence, whereas news stories and columnists of the  Minnesota Spokesman Recorder, have regularly reported on the violence, hate,  and biases reflecting on America's unfinished project of evolving into united  we stand instead of malice toward others.</p>
      <p>The greatest proof of this sense of  anger, frustration, and betrayal is the election of Donald Trump, as seen by  the antagonism toward him by both Democrats and Republicans, and his support by  leading religious groups, whether Roman Catholic, Protestant, or evangelical.</p>
      <p>Democrats and Republicans fostered  policies that led to 60,000 factories closing, sending millions of America's  jobs to China, Mexico, and beyond. Now 100s of thousands of immigrants arrive  to take existing jobs, playing ping pong with census and putting energy into  destroying rather than building. Will our middle class continue to disappear as  our southern border opens ever wider to new arrivals coming as a flood across  the Rio Grande?</p>
      <p>Langston Hughes, a leading light of  the Harlem Renaissance movement summed up our problem with the title of his  1930 novel, "Not Without Laughter." As Maya Angelou opened her introduction to  Hughes novel, "It is dangerous to believe a declaration of seriousness if the  declarant has no sense of humor." We need to match the "little rocket man" DMZ  sense of humor.</p>

        Will Democratic Institutions Survive?</strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>As we prepare for the General Election  of 2020, many theories about the future abound in the Republican and Democratic  parties, as around the world, as many aggressively discuss and debate what  future action to take. Whose dreams about the future will prevail?</p>
      <p>Under the surface of preparing and  controlling our attempts to design and make the future is a disturbing fear: what  does the future hold? How do movies influence our dreams, movie such as "1984,"  "War of the Worlds," "Back to the Future," "Planet of the Apes," "Soylent  Green," and "Mad Max?" Are these warnings or predictions? Will we think and act  wisely about our future? As Steve Jobs said in 1983, "The Future Isn't What It  Used to Be."</p>
      <p>Some of us remember the 1941 book, <em>Escape from Freedom</em>," about the fear of  freedom that causes people to seek safety in <em>authoritarians,  dictators, and various "leaders,' whether </em>liberal or conservative,<em> whether  government or non-government, whether tribal around identity or special  interests, who want to tell us peace and our safety will be ours if we just  follow them.</em><strong> </strong><br>
        <br>
        In  a recent column we noted Americans have been traditionally blessed by the  voices of great thinkers, Black and White. Such as  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK, Nelson Mandella, Mahatma Ghandi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Where  are the thinkers today? When will they step forward? Where are the voices that will help us end our paralysis? .</p>
      <p>Again I ask: what thinkers in our  institutions and in our communities, will aid us in maintaining some balance  regarding the perspectives and overviews that can help us understand the  actions to take to achieve the prize and avoid fear and paralysis? We have offered over 50 solution papers for the conversation. </p>
      <p>Who will survive the 2020 election? A  white person? An African American? A man? A woman? Regardless, any president's  policy successes are ours, just as any president's policy failures are ours as well.  As we move forward, ponder well the 2020 election and the history, promises,  and achievements of its cast of characters. Out of the group of over 20, who  will bring a vision and action to get us out of our paralysis? Will we think  for ourselves?</p>
      <p>The world's nations don't seem  comfortable offering peace. Whose foreign future vision will prevail? America's?  China's? Russia's? Iran's? Africa's? Venuezuela's?</p>
      <p>Many theories are kicked around for  how to play the peace and diplomacy game other than just hoping for the best. Many  are understandably afraid, given so much doubt and hatred based on religion and  race, and on envy and resentment. Much thus comes down to fear. The fear of  losing our way of life, the fear of losing our wealth, the fear of losing our  future, the fear of losing our communities.</p>
      <p>So, let's think of great minds around  the world that are trying to think through the fear and apprehension, through  the anger and frustration. In America, African Americans understand apprehension  and fear better than most, as they have experienced it the most, with Native  Americans understanding it even more.</p>
      <p>Should we play the game, ignore today'  fears and failures, and say we'll succeed tomorrow? Will there be a tomorrow  for a next time? Far too many people have only hope to get by toanother day. What  will be our options as we move towards the election of 2020? Only the Almighty  can answer these questions. We need to hear voices that know what they are  talking about. Absent such thinkers' voices, fear will prevail, not peace. Will  we move forward or backward?</p>

        Will words in reports be backed up with words put to action? </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Not  since Minneapolis was called "Murderopolis" have Twin City African America  communities felt agony from failed answers for dealing with violence in our  communities. During a period two weeks ago, eight African American women were  shot and wounded in five separate incidents in the Twin Cities, including women  stabbed in the middle of Hennepin Avenue.</p>
      <p>The East  Side of St. Paul has become a battle ground for gang violence, with the Rondo  Dale community especially feeling the results of renewed violence, just as in  North and South Minneapolis, as violence devastates communities.</p>
      <p>The Twin  Cities are not alone. For example, in a two-week period recently, in Chicago,  nearly 100 were shot or stabbed.</p>
      <p>There is  great concern in many quarters regarding violence. Families go to bed at night  and wake up in the morning to sounds of gunfire. Official and unofficial  meetings and conversations, continue in government and in profits and  non-profits, including churches, think tanks, universities and policy centers, not  to mention demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Across  America, will we again follow Martin Luther King's non-violence approach, and  judge others by their character and not their color or shade of color, or will  we continue with violence in response to words in reports, newspapers and oral  comments?</p>
      <p>Some say  violence in all its forms is creating a brain drain, a kind of brain flight  from the African American communities, as problem solvers in Black communities bail  out, as seen, for example, in California, Illinois, New York and Minnesota, as  they head for places like Arizona, Atlanta, Texas, Washington DC., etc. ).</p>
      <p>Do those  leaving know something the rest of us don't know or won't consider?</p>
      <p>Could it  be that when talk at meetings and printed words in plans, programs, new papers  and social media, whether official or unofficial, don't solve problems, brains  seem to move on to ply their rhetoric elsewhere? Are guns and other forms of  violence to then become the order of the day?</p>
      <p>Elected  and appointed officials are more cautious as their approaches to solving  violence fail. Will any of the $2 million of the the $20M settlement in the  case of Mohammed Noor go to fighting violence rather than to just reward the  family of the victim?</p>
      <p>The  Minneapolis Foundation, among others, claims to have solutions implementable by  the right people and organizations to solve problems. Why haven't they been  able to effectively address gun, knife, and fist violence in families, schools,  work places, neighborhoods, streets and alleys, after solution words were put  on paper?</p>
      <p>When  leaders and thinkers abandon their communities, hopelessness follows. Needed  are actions to not only provide positive visions for African American  communities, as brains flee, but to also raise up local brains that will stay.</p>
      <p>The  pattern: unkept promises to verify real project employment numbers. Could this  be another reason for both continued violence, whether by guns, knives, or fists,  and the brain drain / brain flight?</p>
      <p>When  will success claims finally be authenticated for such specific projects and  their results, such as the Hollman Project in the late 1990s - 2000s, or, since  then, street and rail projects, professional stadiums and ball parks, and other  private sector, government and education building projects? Or will a major  result be the on-going lowering of confidence in African American community leaders,  who too often talk the walk but do not walk their talk to reduce violence?</p>
      <p>Is  leadership silent in exchange for being quiet about violence and racial  division visions that will never come, as they who developed the failed visions  wait quietly to leave town? We have strong suspicions that this is what it is.</p>

      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>As of the writing of this column, President Donald Trump and his advisors  are continuing to play their own "game of thrones" with countries who would do  the U.S. harm.</p>
      <p>As I wrote in my July 6, 2019 column, the biggest thrones confronting the  United States and the world, include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Russia</strong>, which is also eyeing Europe and the  Middle East. </li>
        <li><strong>China</strong>, which is bragging it will be the world's  high tech leader by 2025, will command the Pacific by 2035 and will be the world's  lead power by 2049, the 100thanniversary of China's Communist  Revolution. </li>
        <li><strong>North Korea</strong>, which is backed by China and Russia. </li>
        <li><strong>Iran,</strong> which is already testing its power in the  Middle East, with an eye on the world. </li>
        <li><strong>Venezuela, </strong>which is backed by Russian, Chinese and  Cuban troops. </li>
        <li><strong>Castro's and Che's followers:</strong> bring down the USA by flooding it  with people and drugs,</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the exception of Russia, these countries are all nations of color.</p>
      <p>With Trump's direction, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National  Security Advisor John Bolton have become messengers of potential war and death.  How much conflict will the president stir  up, let simmer, and then stir up again?</p>
      <p>The U.S. has troops stationed in nearly 150 countries, with some 800  military bases around the world, 76 in Latin America. We are still involved in  armed conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Central Africa. Now what?</p>
      <p>It makes one wonder what Trump's understanding is of the various parts of  the world. Is he properly educated on the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between  North and South Korea, the Persian Gulf states, and Latin America, as he flirts  with danger?</p>
      <p>Currently, 28,000 Americans are in the DMZ that separates North and South  Korea. And what about the nearly three million Arab and Persian soldiers in the  Persian Gulf, not to mention the 128,000 in the Venezuela military in a country  twice the size of Iraq?</p>
      <p>Does the Trump administration understand what the casualty figures could  be, with so many troops used as chips in this game of thrones? But, the  question that must always be asked is what would be "acceptable" casualties in  any conflict? What is an acceptable casualty figure for both sides of the  current state of affairs? How are casualties seen as worth it?</p>
      <p>The American public does not know how to ask those questions nor the question of what makes an American. Americans are actually more  apprehensive of war today than in the early days following Sept.  11, although some Trump supporters won't admit it.</p>
      <p>What is Trump's rationale? What is his voice of logic and reason? Without a  voice of reason, the result could be great tragedy between now and the 2020  election.</p>
      <p>This is not like shopping in a supermarket, starring in a hit series about  war or play-acting at an amusement park. This is serious.</p>
      <p>Is Trump marching to the 1930 drums of former UK Prime Minister Neville  Chamberlain while playing the game of Munich? Do we really know? Those too young  to remember are part of the masses who do not recognize how dangerous this world  situation is.</p>
      <p>Trump. Pompeo. Bolton. Are these three horsemen of the apocalypse riding  toward death and mayhem, expecting nations to follow them over the cliff &mdash; and  not ask questions?</p>
      <p>We ask the president: how many lives will be lost in this continued quest  to establish this "game of thrones" legacy? God help us all, and God bless  America. </p>

        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>As of the writing of this  column, Donald Trump and his advisors continue to play their game of thrones  with those who would do us harm. Donald Trump clearly has a list of countries  he is willing to confront.</p>
      <p>The biggest thrones challenging  us are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Russia (also eying Europe and the Middle East).</li>
        <li>China (bragging they will be the world's leader  in high tech by 2025, will command the Pacific by 2035 and will be the word's  lead power by 2049, the 100th anniversary of China's Communist  Revolution).</li>

        <li>Venezuela (backed with Cuban, Russian and  Chinese troops in country, following Castro's and Che's strategy to flood the  United States with people and drugs.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let's be mindful that with the  exception of Russia, these countries are nations of color.</p>
      <p>The United States raised most  countries from the rubble of World War II (including the "axis" of Germany,  Japan, and Italy, as well as England and France). We have troops stationed in  nearly 150 countries, with some 800 military bases around the world, 76 in  Latin America. We are still involved in armed conflict  in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Central Africa. Now what?</p>
      <p>How much conflict will the  President stir up, let simmer, and then stir up again? The question that must  always be asked, as I did in this column a year ago: what would be "acceptable"  casualties in any conflict? How are casualties seen as worth it?</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Pompeo and  National Security advisor Bolton are messengers of potential war and death. Americans  are more apprehensive today than the early days after 9/11, although some Trump  supporters won't admit it.</p>
      <p>As we said in this column  several weeks ago, this Republic has been blessed since 1776, with leaders who  were American heroes, including Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, the two  Roosevelts, and JFK. What is Trump's rationale? What is his voice of "logic"  and "reason?"</p>
      <p>Without a voice of reason, the  result could be great tragedy between now and the 2020 election. One wonders  what Donald Trump's understanding is of the various parts of the world,  especially the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between North and South Korea, the  Persian Gulf states, and Latin America? Is he flirting with danger or being  realistic?</p>
      <p>We ask the President: what is  an acceptable casualty figure for both sides? Currently, 28,000 Americans are  in the DMZ that separates North and South Korea. And what about the nearly 3  million Arab and Persian soldiers in the Persian Gulf, not to mention the  128,000 in the Venezuela military, in a country twice the size of Iraq?</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1910d0516" id="c1910d0516"></a>May, 16, 2019 #10: Noor and $20 million; Noor imprisoned in Oak Park Heights </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>The saga of Mohammed Noor has  ended. A jury of his peers found him guilty on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, of the  fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, in 2017, the first time a Minnesota police  officer has been found guilty of an on-duty murder, charging Noor with third-degree  murder and second-degree manslaughter. The jury acquitted him of the most  serious count &mdash; second-degree murder. </p>
      <p>The Star  Tribune reported that Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has "defended every  prevous police shooting investigation his office has reviewed &mdash; and cleared of  criminal wrongdoing &mdash; as "superb."</p>
      <p>Three days later, Fri, May 3rd, at  6 am, Mohammed Noor was taken by a rented Greyhound bus to the Minnesota  maximum security prison at Oak Parks Heights. He is to be sentenced by the  Judge on June 7th. No major newspaper, as of the writing of this  story, has reported Noor's circumstances.</p>
      <p>Judges signing orders to remove  prisoners from the Hennepin County Jail to the Minnesota Super max, are not  required to provide factual information, other than to say it was for security  reasons. That is broad and vague and is fraught with additional opportunity for  cruel and unusual punishment for this man of color. The rumors are that  Mohammed Noor will not survive inside that notorious super max prison.</p>
      <p>The nation is aware that the most  severe punishment, short of his death, has been imposed. The Star Tribune talks  of an appeal but it is, in our opinion, that Mohammed Noor will never survive  to know the results of his appeal. We would be remiss in this column if we did  not point out that in order to silence the Somali community, their leadership  has been told that deportation of even native born Somalis will take place if  they are publicly critical of the prosecution of the trial and of his current  imprisonment in the super max prison facility at Oak Park Heights.</p>
      <p>Questions easily come to mind. Is  this is another return to a time of selective acts of slavery, when there were  no rights that a black person had, that the white justice system was just for  whites.? Is the respect here modeled after Guantanamo and the secret courts? We  were a tad surprised that Mr. Noor's attorney of record did not immediately let  the general public know the actions taken against Mr. Noor, and the dangers he  faces in regards to his life and future survival.</p>
      <p>It is no accident that Mr. Noor is  being housed in close proximity to neo-Nazis and was transferred with  sympathizers that were being transferred from the Iowa prison in Ft. Madison,  Iowa.</p>
      <p>Why is there such a lack of concern  for the future safety of Mohammed Noor?. All that the communities of color can  do is pray for his survival and safety. $20 million goes a long way in  determining what types of things have to happen to facilitate the ultimate  vendetta against Mohammed Noor. Contrary to what is being said, it is about  race, and it is a warning to the sons and daughters of the African regarding  what the future could hold in justice and liberty that have become fake  declarations. We are not seeing the justice of white justice on display.</p>
      <p>It has not gone unnoticed that we  also saw Black justice that week, when Senior U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, intervened, after the Noor  verdict, to get the settlement talks in the Jamar Clark lawsuit resumed, that  has been shamefully delayed for over 2 years. Jamar Clark was shot dead by  police in 2015.</p>
      <p>Will there be a "transformative"  amount for the Clark family as for Damon family.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1909d0502" id="c1909d0502"></a>May, 02, 2019 #09: Trump vs. the United States. President gears up for Supreme Court Battle </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>On Monday, April 22, President  Donald Trump and the Trump organization filed suit against the U.S. House of  Representatives House Oversight Committee (chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings,  D-Maryland), suing to prevent the financial records of the Trump organizations  and family from being obtained from their accounting firm.</p>
      <p>This is setting a legal  precedent of a President suing the country of which he is the President. It  will be the fact forever attached to his name, that the Donald Trump suing the  USA was also the President of the USA.</p>
      <p>This will test the limits of  the Supreme Court of the United States (referred to as SCOTUS). - My analysis  is that President Trump seems to expect the 9-member Supreme Court to vote in  favor of his case when it reaches the Court, overturning the 535 members of  Congress (Senators plus Representatives). But the votes that will truly judge  this case will be the millions of voters who vote in the election of 2020.</p>
      <p>We said in this column two  weeks ago that this president is going to wear down the stamina and the energy  of the SCOTUS, despite advisors convinced this is not the path to take, just as  members of Congress have determined the path of multiple investigations and,  potentially, impeachment (also against advisors). Will these paths combine to  shred the Constitution and create more division? Will the SCOTUS represent a  greater support platform for the president than the congress and the American  public? At stake is the stability of our country.</p>
      <p>The president continues to say  the US economy and military are as strong as they have ever been in our  history. Will this last? Will it be temporary under Trump? Can Democrats act  such that it brings the country together to make the good news long lasting and  not temporary? Is this nation tough enough, strong enough, committed enough and  honest enough to show the courage to bring the nation back together again? Our  question is not about the prosperity bus but about who will be pushed to the  back of the prosperity bus. This is about both parties, as seen in this April  24, 2019 Star Tribune headline, about Democratic Governor Tim Walz's proposed  budget: <em>Lowest income-Minnesotans hit  hardest by Gov. Tim Walz.</em></p>
      <p>Let's be candid about 2020: the  two parties have made their bets about which path to take. Yet I see no  contender in the Democratic Party nor any challenger in the Republican Party  who are prepared to provide the leadership this country so desperately needs  for results that are long term, not just short term.</p>
      <p>Americans have long had the  confidence that someone who would always step up to take the challenge and be  victorious. My chilling feeling is that the messenger we await is not about to  arrive. How will "Trump vs. the United states of America" go? A frightening  question. It does not bode well for unity nor for preserving the importance and  efficacy of the nation's Constitution, especially if either party sacrifices  "We the people" for "we the party," and hold "life" and "liberty" and "the  pursuit of happiness" for one side and not for the other side?</p>
      <p>This is what the 1st  amendment and USA ideas for institutions of democracy are all about. Those who  wish to tinker with what we call the United States of America must first offer  a prayer for strength and guidance for how and for which path. That is what the  court case Trump vs. the USA will be about: which path. Let us pray for  strength, vision, and the wisdom for this decision. God knows we need that. Hence  our prayers.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1908d0418" id="c1908d0418"></a>April, 18, 2019 #08: The Noor Trial Begins. Jury Selection has ended. </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Article On  April 8 2019, Hennepin County District Judge Kathryn Quaintance gaveled  the opening of the trial of Mohammed Noor, former Minneapolis police officer,  on trial for the July 15, 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.</p>
      <p>The shooting tragedy for both  sides is not denied. For some, the shooting death shall forever live in infamy.  For others, the legal process up to this point has been one of suspicion, as  seen in legal questions reported by the Star Tribune the morning of the first  day of the trial, that the presiding judge changed her mind to allow showing  video to the public, due to the intervening in this trial by both  official Minneapolis and multiple news organizations.</p>
      <p>Originally charged with 3rd degree murder and  1st degree manslaughter, County Attorney Michael Freeman, a year later, in 2018, fresh from victory of  being elected for another four-year term, upgraded the charge against Mohammed  Noor to 2nd degree murder. This is the first time in the history of  Minnesota that a peace officer has been charged with both offenses.</p>
      <p>In our next column, in two  weeks, we will write of the significance of the racial complexion of the jury.  There has already been controversy in regard to the number of both media and  citizens that will be allowed in one of the smallest courtrooms in the government  center. The Australian media has almost as many seats as the American media, by  order of the presiding judge.</p>
      <p>According to Anglo Saxon law,  the prosecution goes first. In presenting its case against Mohammed Noor, the prosecution  may call as many as 50 witnesses who allegedly have knowledge regarding the shooting,  even though only four were in the alley. Prosecution witnesses will tell their  stories, attempting to reflect on Mohammed Noor in the most negative of ways. The  complexities are why the Judge has indicated why it is often difficult for a trial to be fair. In our March 21, 2019 column, we  acknowledged this regarding any trial pursuing justice. Justice is based on  rules. In our March 15 2018 column, we wrote that it appeared that part of the  Noor trial will be based on a mis-interpretation of the Minnesota  Constitution.</p>
      <p>Among the questions we hope the  trial answers is who, other than the homicide detectives, called Justine's  fianc&eacute; in his room at his hotel in NYC (or Las Vegas; we have heard both). And  who from the Minneapolis Police Department called government 0fficials in  Australia and provided information to Australia's Prime Minister Turnbull,  alleging the violent nature and the poor training of Black officers in the  Minneapolis Police Department?</p>
      <p>What calls were made on the  night of July 15 and early morning of July 16? Were these calls authorized by  the command staff in the MPD? These questions are reinforced by articles  presented in Australian papers and by other Australian media.<br>
        As of the writing of this  column, the defense was debating whether to put Mohammed Noors on the stand in  this very volatile case. Why is it only one other Somali in the 5th precinct,  who was acting as a supervisor of that night for the city, was told of the  death of Justine, and ordered to disengage and not carry out his responsibility  or supervision? That raises other questions regarding bias toward Somalis. In  the interest of unity and fairness, these and other questions should be  answered under oath. Failure to do less supports the judge's concern about a fair  trial and a true effort to reach a fair conclusion on the spectrum dealing with  levels of guilt and intent.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1907d0404" id="c1907d0404"></a>April, 04, 2019 #07: Special counsel reports "no collusion" with the Russians.</strong><strong>Attorney General to rule on whether obstruction took place</strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>After a little over two years,  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has forwarded his findings to the Attorney  General of the United States (a 4-page summary is on line, as we wait for  more). The report's conclusion of "no collusion" between Trump and his campaign  with the Russians, has Democrats and mainstream journalists in a meltdown, as  the belief is how else could Trump have beaten Hillary?</p>
      <p>This "no collusion conclusion"  reveals how many elected and appointed politicians, and their staffs, including  2020 candidates, and the journalists that spread their talking points, have not  only fooled us, but that they have believed only their view could prevail,  demonstrating how little they understand about the difference between their  views and the Constitution's directives that govern the process in general and  how the Congress failed to follow its own Special Counsel rules.</p>
      <p>We can only conclude that Cable  TV and print media are exposed as being intellectually shallow, historically  ignorant, incompetent and lacking in knowledge and understanding of the constitution  and the USA institutions entrusted to them for safeguarding the rights of  American citizens now and into the future, including the Constitution's rules  for political engagement and all matters pertaining to the election of 2016. Legislators  and mainstream journalists should be embarrassed.</p>
      <p>These legislators and  journalists, the alleged guardians of the constitution, have been behaving as  little children on a political playground, where name calling and petty actions  expose their laziness and lack of understanding of what they should have  understood about the Special Counsel's report, dragging the American public  through their bureaucratic mud.</p>
      <p>House Democrats are setting  Mueller's report aside, ordering eighty-one new investigations, as both Maxine  Waters and House Judicial Committee Chairman Adler have said the Mueller report  is not the end but instead just the beginning of investigating trump.</p>
      <p>One can only imagine how many  law suits from legislative committees and various public interest groups will  flow from these 81 investigations, the result of which will exhaust the Supreme  Court with endless cases of litigation.</p>
      <p>News outlets (print, broadcast  and digital), including those in the Twin Cities, will also be exhausted by all  the moves and counter moves. Will it take a second civil war between the  political left and right to bring order?</p>
      <p>Abraham Lincoln said &quot;Truth is generally the best vindication against  slander.&quot; With all the counter "truths," which truth will prevail? What  will be the price paid by main stream media for misleading readers and viewers  for over two years with the claim that Muellers report would show that  all was "settled:" that Trump colluded with the Russians to defeat Hilary.</p>
      <p>I know how difficult it will be  for some to accept my conclusion that "Vladamir Putin has won," as the campaign  dossier that started all of this was aided and abetted by Russia's meddling,  which it has done for over 30 years. Russia/Putin's success in helping to  control and interfere in the American election has gone beyond anything those  in the Kremlin could have dreamt up.</p>
      <p>Many ask how this will affect  the 2020 election. Both sides say it will help their side get elected. Whichever  way it goes after the meltdown over the Mueller Report's unexpected "no  collusion" conclusion, the questions remain: will "God Bless America?" "Will  God help deliver us from mainstream journalism's ineptness, laziness, and  indifference? How long will "America the beautiful" remain America the confused  and duped? Finally, will American sons and daughters have to fall on internal  fields of battle in order to preserve this nation?</p>
      <p>Offer a prayer not only for  yourself but for all of us. We will need it.</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1906d0321" id="c1906d0321"></a>March, 21, 2019 #06: The Mohammed Noor and Terrance Franklin. Trials Important trials in the pursuit of justice. </strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>Two important, high profile  trials will soon take place in Minneapolis regarding Mohammed Noor and Terrance  Franklin.</p>
      <p>The first is the April trial of  Mohammed Noor, the former Minneapolis Police officer, accused of murder and manslaughter in the shooting  death of Justine Damond, July 15, 2017. Justine Damon, was a white  Australian citizen. See my August 3, 2017 and my March 1 and July 5, 2018 columns.</p>
      <p>The second trial, ordered by  the U.S. Supreme Court, will deal with the violent death of Terrance Franklin  at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers in the basement of a house in  South Minneapolis, six years ago, was originally scheduled for April also. It  has been postponed until October.</p>
      <p>As we have noted before, the  Minnesota State Constitution states that the decision of whether to indict or  not indict is the purview of the Grand Jury, once empaneled, not the county  attorney, which violated Noor's constitutional rights.</p>
      <p>With the US Supreme Court's  order in late 2017, to go to trial, the quest for justice for Terrance Franklin  is finally upon us. See my 2013 columns of May 22, May 29, June 12, June 19.</p>
      <p>In the case of former police  officer Mohammed Noor, it is difficult to see how he will get a fair trial in  the 2nd degree murder charge laid against him.</p>
      <p>Both trials will test the  scales of fairness and justice in our city.</p>
      <p>The Appellate Law Firm in  Washington D.C., argued the merits of the case of Terrance Franklin, for the  trustee of his estate, his father Walter Louis Franklin II, Terrance Franklin's  suing heir.</p>
      <p>Minneapolis is the hardened  defendant pursuing the idea that the pursuit of justice for the one will never  be overcome by the quest of evasion by the many.</p>
      <p>Many may pretend that they have  forgotten the case of the death of Terrance Franklin, but it was the united  decision of the US Supreme Court that justce would not be denied to Terrance  Franklin and his heirs. His father, Walter Frankln, is to be admired for the  tenacious pursuit of justice for his son.</p>
      <p>The city is said to have agreed  to settle for millions of dollars in the cae of Terance Franlin, but as of the  writing of this column, we cannot find in the archives any such offer.</p>
      <p>These trials will provide true  testing, for the future of fairness and integrity in Minneapolis courts. Some  felt the pursuit of justice would ever complete the cycle of lying about the  brutal killing of Terrance Franklin six years ago. Finally we will hear of the  circumstances, the facts, and the last moments of Terrance Franklin's life begore  he was shot and killed in that basement.</p>
      <p>The City of Minneapolis has  protected wrong doing in the death of Franklin. It will be interesting to see  how the federal trial judge rules on motions by the City of Minneapolis to  block testimoney that is extremely embarrassing to the city and the calculated  actions attempted by the city to cover the wrongful death of Terrance Franklin.</p>
      <p>In is sad that for the  exception of law firms and this column, the Frankloin family has had to sand  alone. Before the decision of the US Supreme Court, the city felt it had it all  figured out. Who would have thought that the US Supreme court would order that  Terrance Franklin would had his day in court.</p>
      <p>The cases of Mohammed<strong> </strong>Noor and Terrance Franklin<strong> </strong>shall be a demanding task in the  pursuit of justice and race relations in the state of Minnesota.,</p>

      <p><strong><a name="c1905d0307" id="c1905d0307"></a>March, 07, 2019 #05: </strong><strong> Donald, Are You Happy Now?</strong><strong>Conflict and Death in Venezuela</strong></p>
      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>As we predicted a month ago,  conflict, violence and death has erupted along the Venezuela - Columbia border.  No one knows the true casualty figures, although foreign news media are  indicating it is, so far, a small number of persons shot and killed. On the  Venezuela &ndash; Brazil border, large caravans of trucks with food and medicine for  the Venezuela people from the UN's World Health Organization, have been halted  and prevented from entering by Venezuela's self-proclaimed leader, Arturo  Maduro (America, most Latin American countries, and key European countries do  not recognize Maduro as the legitimate leader).</p>
      <p>The Trump Administration  assured the American public and the rest of the world that the Venezuelan  military would turn on the Maduro regime, causing it to fall. As of this  writing, the Maduro government still stands. Will it continue to? As American  propaganda is being promoted, Russia, China and Cuba continue to build  fortifications and pour assets into Venezuela, in support of Maduro.</p>
      <p>The mishandled Venezuelan  crises situation is the result of poor planning by America, Venezuela, and  other countries.</p>
      <p>Venezuela is crucial, as what  happens in Venezuela will directly affect the the Black and Hispanic  communities of the Twin Cities. As we have noted before, in the 1960s, both  Martin Luther King and Caesar Chavez went to the border and asked that it be  closed, as those crossing the open border were taking jobs that Blacks and  Hispanics would have had, and caused wages for those working to be suppressed. For  50 years, both political parties have let this continue, for their own  purposes.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, it is clear to  the trained eye that Donald Trump is taking advantage of helpful diversions,  including the meetings he had in Hanoi, Vietnam, the week of February 27, with Vietnam's  President Nguyen Phu Trong,  and then with North Korean  leader Kim Jong Un, as well as his upcoming meeting in March, at  Mar-a-lago, with Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>Many are still trying to  decipher Donald Trump's playbook (it has been reported that many are seeking  clues in Trump's book, <em>The Art of the Deal). </em>Yet Trump is absolutely predictable, which suggests Nancy Pelosi and the  new team of Democrats in Congress need to study harder to better understand his  playbook.</p>
      <p>The same disappointment holds  regarding America 4th estate, which has also not figured out the  rules of engagement with Trump nor with the special counsel's playbooks,  regarding perceived do's, don'ts and can'ts.</p>
      <p>In the late spring of this  year, expect the United States Supreme Court to be called upon to rule on the  moving big political board constitutional pieces of power regarding the  authority of the executive branch of the American government. How long will  America's future remain in the hands of those in Congress, whether Democrat or  Republican, who continue to act as children on a New York city playground?  Government, complex and challenging, needs grown ups to recognize fairness, not  just power, to maintain equality of opportunity for all, not just for partisan  party favorites.</p>
      <p>We are reminded of the adults  like Thurgood Marshall and colleagues who dealt with Jim Crow by avoiding  childish fits of violence and keeping their eyes on the prize. When they found  the tough task of undoing Jim Crow causing them "distressed moments," they  turned to the single dissent of Justice John Marshall Harlan, a former slave  owner, in the "separate but equal" ruling of Plessy v Ferguson, who "grew up"  to write that the Constitution as amended (and especially the 14th  amendment), "removed the race line from our governmental systems" and  prohibited any arbitrary separation of citizens "on the basis of color." We  urge the elected and appointed officials in Congress and state houses, to seek  that same vision that Thurgood Marshall found in our Constitution.</p>

      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
        <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
      <p>What does the recent gun and  drug violence in Minneapolis say to those considering coming to Minneapolis for  the NCAA's "March Madness" Men's Final Four Basketball Championship?</p>
      <p>Gun violence is escalating in  both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Citizens learned two and a half weeks ago on  their early Sunday news that five had been shot in both affluent and poor  neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Two white professional women,  mother and daughter, one in her 60s, the other in her mid-40s, were shot and  killed in their luxury apartment in downtown Minneapolis, in the same  neighborhood as Mayor Jacob Fry. The Chamber of Commerce and other important  leaderships demanded explanations from city officials. regarding the  circumstances surrounding the deaths of the women in their luxury apartment,  just across the river from the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>The murderer, a next door  neighbor, was soon arrested for the killing of the two women.</p>
      <p>Two individuals were shot in  their car in North Minneapolis, and another person was shot and wounded in the  uptown area of south Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>Previous to those incidents, on  Tuesday February 5th, a Minneapolis School District bus driver was shot and  wounded on the exit of 35W and Chicago Avenue, collateral damage of road rage  of others. The only student on board, a five-year-old child, was endangered. The  school bus driver, a 78-year-old American military veteran, threw himself  across the beautiful 5-year-old African American child to shield her when the  man attempted to enter the bus to continue shooting.</p>
      <p>The driver was shot in the head  and arm by an individual wearing a security guard uniform. Police arrived  within a minute and apprehended the shooter.</p>
      <p>The shooter was a man who had  shot and killed a 16-year-old African American in 2015, a man who is a Mall  Cop, and one who patrols the Hawthorn Crossing in the African American  community.</p>
      <p>Two women came to the aid of  the bus driver by blocking the bus door, preventing the shooting of the little  girl.</p>
      <p>The gunman claimed that he was  shooting in self-defense. But defending against who? The 78-year-old driver on  a bus? The 5-year-old child? The law is clear: it is not considered defense  when shooting multiple times.</p>
      <p>But there was more than just  gun violence. The drug epidemic is also taking a toll. These events cause  people to feel unsafe on the streets, unsafe in their homes, and unsafe as they  go about their business.<br>
        s<br>
        What is the solution? What must  be done to solve these acts of violence? I report. I analyse. I make  suggestions. It is up to officials and neighborhood leaders to work out the  solutions. But I can tell you as one whose boots are on the ground that this is  a dangerous environment for our city's citizens and our city's reputation. Is  this what Justice Marshall meant by civilization crumbling when important  issues are not addressed?</p>
      <p>These issues need to be  addressed, and done so effectively and swiftly. For some reason, Minneapolis  police tell us that auto stops are down 79% and drug arrests are down 45%,  showing they are good at keeping records. But we must ask the question of  whether there is something lacking in the implementation of solutions leaving  these dangerous problem to continue.</p>
      <p>In this column, our prayers go to  the deceased and to those being threatened. We do not believe this is the  Minneapolis that was sold to the NCAA for their 2019 Final Four Championship  finals in this city. We hope that the host committee will not be embarrassed by  a city that has become unsafe and dangerous, as they prepare for the Final Four  in April.</p>

      <p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><em><br>
        A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the </em><a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank"><strong><em>Minnesota  Spokesman-Recorder</em></strong></a></p>
      <p>Betrayal is a dangerous charge against anyone entrusted with a nation's  security. As this column is being written, the nation is on edge, waiting to  know whether to trust President Trump with the protection of America and its  constitution. Our nation's safety and security hang in the balance.</p>
      <p>The latest allegations that Trump is in collusion with and has  greater obedience and relationship to Russia and Vladimir Putin than to America  are chilling and not to be dismissed lightly. If true, they threaten the very  foundation of the institutions of America's democracy, as this column has long  reported.</p>
      <p>The reports in newspapers, magazines and journals, broadcast  news programs and investigative specials, combined with the review of court  filings against the presidents' associates and others, have exposed a potential  dark side of those involved in the governance of our country.</p>
      <p>The president keeps saying there was no collusion. But, the  level of discomfort in our democratic institutions represents clear and present  dangers &mdash; the kinds that cause nations and their democratic institutions to  fail. </p>
      <p>One way or another, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on  his ongoing investigation will state whether the allegations against the  president are seen as true or not true. </p>
      <p>"I don't know what that report is going to have in it," said  Representative Elijah Cummings during an appearance on 60 Minutes on January  13. "One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it exonerates the  president&hellip; I want &hellip; the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it  so that everybody can make a judgment," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy," added Rep.  Cummings. "This is serious business."</p>
      <p>As chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Rep.  Cummings will be empowered &mdash; and this is key &mdash; with constitutional authority to  both compel testimony and demand documents, especially those Republicans who  have heretofore blocked. As CBS News reported, "the committee has the  constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants&hellip;making Cummings one  of the most powerful people in Washington."</p>
      <p>Losing the House may have been the best thing for Republicans,  for who would believe Muellers' report? This is why so many Republicans are  uneasy, wondering whether the man who was entrusted with America's security is  guilty of the allegations of high crimes and misdemeanors. </p>
      <p>Not since the secession crisis of 1860 has this country been faced  with a constitutional crisis as grave as this one. The branches of government  were designed to include everyone &mdash; "we the people" &mdash; which is why it is  imperative that the political parties of this nation quickly devise, commit to  and implement a compromise and strategy that will preserve the Articles of the  United States Constitution.</p>
      <p>Failure to do so will clearly guarantee the collapse of the  institutions of government that have been the foundation of the United States  of America.</p>
      <p>And, Americans need to admit our concern regarding the strengths  and the institutions, which have served and protected the United States of  America since 1777 (notwithstanding slavery, Jim Crow, treatment of American  Indians, and ongoing civil rights battles).</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we await Mueller's word. With Cummings and the  Democrats in charge, the fear that Mueller's report will be suppressed and lead  to a constitutional crisis that would make Watergate pale in comparison is  greatly reduced.</p>

      <p>Future  historians will identify 2019 as a year crucial to determining America's future.  There will be a lot of volatility as America continues dividing into opposing  factions that attempt to control the others. Only time will tell who will  attain and hold the high ground. Consider these 11 questions for 2019, in no  particular order. Responses will impact our future:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Will we have  a southern wall by December of 2019, and if so will it be effective?</li>
        <li>Will we have  a strong economy that will remain strong or will it turn weak?</li>
        <li>Will the impact  of the government shutdown be mild or severe?</li>
        <li>What will America's  relationship be with China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, and will these  nations succeed in strengthening their positions against us in Africa and South  America?</li>
        <li>Will civil  rights provide equality of opportunities for education, jobs and housing or will it lower  results by stressing equality through redistribution to achieve "equal"  results?</li>
        <li>Will we show by our own efforts we can perform at the same  level as whites, and, thus let future public and corporate policy be based on the  reality we demonstrate? </li>
        <li>Will, as Nellie  Stone Johnson would ask, the educated part of the black community and churches  stop their narrow concentration on those in the middle class and not attend to  the civil rights and the right to eat and work of non-middle class blacks in  inner cities?</li>
        <li>Will Nellie Stone Johnson's concern for the partnership of  blacks and whites finally allow blacks who have been written off and left behind  as a large residue in urban ghettos, be integrated into the middle class  through education, jobs, and housing?</li>
        <li>Where will  America have a military presence in the world, and what will be the war domain areas  beyond the conventional: cyber, environmental, financial, trade, cultural,  legal, narrative, etc, none of  which resemble the stereotype of conventional warfare seen in movies,  especially regarding North Korea's denuclearization stalemate, Beijing's  expansion into the South China Sea, Russia's invasion of Ukraine that they  might try to expand, and the wars in Yemen and the anarchy in the Congo?</li>
        <li>Will Trump  and congress relate confrontationally or engage in bipartisan collaboration?</li>
        <li>Will  America's rainbow of great black, white, brown, and yellow minds and experts  correctly evaluate America's path through 2019? In this column, we will be  evaluating as well.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It is  too early to predict success or failure. We'll know more by the middle of 2019.</p>
      <p>Given  the conditions we face as a nation, now more than ever is the time to offer  prayers for the stability of all communities in 2019, and to offer help and hope  to each other.</p>
      <p>This  column will follow events closely, and report to our readers the issues of the  day, and the consequences of the results regarding attempts and failures of  daily actions regarding these issues. We will watch these areas and conditions,  especially in terms of the seven central theme areas we have written about since  2003:, education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, governing and  local economic development, as well as the contests over the ideas presented on  how to deal with these issues, as we evaluate how communities of color deal  with those seeking to either stabilize or destabilize our communities.</p>
      <p>It  may sound complex but really it is not. There will be patterns of success and  failure based on events and conditions that we in our various communities  already expect and already have solutions to propose for our problems, our issues,  and our future.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Seat_190x300.jpg" alt="A Seat For Everyone, by Ron Edwards" width="190" height="300"></p>
      <p><strong>About my new book:  A Seat for Everyone</strong></p>
      <p>We are all part of a great country that still has what Lincoln called "unfinished business," about which Martin Luther King, Jr. said we can no longer wait to have it completed. </p>
      <p>Thanks to all who have offered congratulations and asked questions. You can order the book on my publisher's website, <a href="Http://www.beacononthehill.com" target="_blank">www.beacononthehill.com</a>. It is subtitled <strong>"The Freedom Guide that Explores a Vision for America."</strong></p>
      <p>The sad part is that this is a book that should have been written by the NAACP, the Urban League, the leadership forum, or the ministers association. They have remained silent. Worse: acquiescent silence. </p>
      <p>The Urban League tossed Nellie Stone Johnson and me out a while back, and five years ago the NAACP national expelled me for writing my first book. So much for the First Amendment. </p>
      <p>I will not be silent. I will not lie down. Sadly, our once young and energetic civil rights leaders have atrophied and become keepers of the status quo they once fought against. They have brought the Civil Rights Movement to a standstill in the inner city. </p>
      <p>My hope is that, win or lose, the candidacy of Barack Obama rejuvenates the Civil Rights Movement with its lost energy and enables it to again refocus its eye on the prize, a seat for everyone, not just for the self-appointed leaders who now serve the mastuh. They have their seats at the table. I say there must be a seat for everyone. </p>
      <p>You won't read about what is in my book in the <em>Star Tribune </em>and mainstream media. They don't want you to read all the news, only the news they want you to read. Only the <em>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder </em>provides you with the news they won't. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.beacononthehill.com" target="_blank"><u>A Seat for Everyone: <strong>The Freedom Guide that Explores a Vision for America</strong></u></a> discusses the major status quo areas that have shown little or no progress: inner-city education, jobs, housing and public safety. I also reference key past columns and where to find them on my Minneapolis Story website. </p>
      <p>Also discussed in detail are the two historic lawsuits against the Minneapolis Police Department brought by Black officers. The conditions resulting in this litigation have had a profound impact on public safety in our city and in the City/MPD's treatment of its Black officers. The outcome will also have significant impacts. </p>
      <p>Minneapolis is so delusional that it has defined "minorities" to include so many "diverse" groups that it proudly boasts it can now comply with minority hiring without having to hire Blacks. My book discusses this insult as well. Why is everyone else silent about this? </p>
      <p>A unique feature is that the book "marries" the online world with that of traditional book publishing. I present my argument in less than 100 pages. This slim volume (literally, as it is easy to put it in your pocket and carry around for easy reference) includes five columns and one blog essay and lists additional columns that can easily be found at: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocarchives.htm">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com/tocarchives.htm</a>. </p>
      <p>The book presents a beacon of hope for the current lows in inner-city education, jobs, housing, and public safety. We need to work together to stand up for Black youth and stop waiting for the city government and its teachers unions as they continue to lie down also, rather than stand up for our kids in our schools. </p>
      <p>It all starts with education. As Nellie always stated, "No education, no jobs, no housing."   Senator Obama would add, "No hope." My book brings hope back to the discussion.</p>

      <p><strong>Inaugural  Column: The Minneapolis Story Continues, Through My Eyes, 2003 - 2019</strong></p>
      <p><strong>March  26, 2003</strong>: <strong>Freedom's  Prize: Equal Access, Equal Opportunity</strong></p>
      <p>For 40  years in Minneapolis I have fought for the Civil Rights prize of equality's  liberty and freedom for all. It is an honor and a pleasure to greet you the  readers of the Spokesman-Recorder as your newest columnist, as I share with you  the continued struggle to achieve equal access and equal opportunity for all. I  will ask the question, "how, is/are (fill in the blank), promoting or retarding  equal access and equal opportunity in Minneapolis, in such areas as politics  (including elections and redistricting); police-community relations (including  mediation); jobs/wages (including contract compliance), housing (including  Hollman/Heritage Park), education; Black-White leadership (including the Urban  League, the NAACP, and the City Council); and raising up young Black men. I  will record the words spoken and the actions taken in Minneapolis that answer  those question, and which show the "state of the city" in terms of equal access  and equal opportunity.</p>
      <p>I will  write from the perspective of <strong>seven themes: (1)</strong> encouraging everyone not to take their eyes  off liberty's prize: freedom and equality; <strong>(2)</strong> working to include everyone at the table  set by Minneapolis, seeking equal access and equal opportunity for everyone; <strong>(3)</strong> to tell it like it is, as I see it through  my eyes, based on my past experience in Civil Rights activism in Minneapolis  (16 years as Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Minneapolis Civil Rights  Commission, 1968-1973 and 1979-1983; 11 years as President of the Minneapolis  Urban League and 17 years on the Executive Committee 1971-1989; work with the  NAACP as Housing Chairman 1999-2002 and Executive Committee 1999-2002; and  Spokesperson for the Black Police Officer's Association, 1996-Present); <strong>(4)</strong><strong> </strong>recognizing that no one group has a  monopoly on truth although each has part of the truth, and to speak of the  truths as well as the falsehoods of both the political right and the political  left, as we seek that common ground on which we can all stand from which to  work together to solve common problems; <strong>(5)</strong> expose racial injustice, best described in  James Baldwin's phrase, that the system is geared to keep the ni**er in his  place; <strong>(6)</strong> update  these topics from my new book, <strong>"The  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</strong>, which is available from <strong>Beacon On The Hill Press</strong> and from <strong>Amazon.com. </strong>Finally, <strong>(7)</strong> to join with Spokesman readers in the  common cause to make Minneapolis a better place for everyone. This column, like  my book, will pull the covers back and expose the Minneapolis experiments in  racial injustice, whether carried out by Whites or Blacks or both, just as I do  weekly on my "Black Focus" program on Channel 17, MTN-TV, Sundays, 5-7 p.m.</p>
      <p>The  Minneapolis Story is not only good for Minneapolis, it is good for America. It  is a story that needs to be told. There are many upset by events "out there" as  they cry out for peace in the world. I cry out for peace in Minneapolis. But I  tell you that unless there is justice there and here, along with freedom, there  can be no peace there and here. We must promote liberty over slavery, truth  over lies, and freedom over dependency, in our common search for justice,  fairness and freedom as well as dignity and trust. That refers to state and  local budgets as well.</p>
      <p>Like  you, I want Minneapolis to be a city where the imperatives of the human spirit  can shine through. I want a city where healthy, well-educated children will  grow up into healthy well-educated adults. We need to prepare our young people,  especially our young Black men, for real work in real places and end policies  resulting in so many young Black men winding up in jail, abandoning the  families they have started, and not contributing positively to their  communities. We must all work together to end the cycle of abuse, be it by us  on each other or by the power structures of our community. We have to clean up  our own doorsteps as we complain about the doorsteps of others. Will we, as a  Black and White community, pay more attention to those we have left behind?  Will we work harder, now, before they get re-arrested and taken back to jail?  Because I keep telling my publisher to "put this up on the web," they are  working on creating a Web Log (or Blog) for me to use on <strong>www.The  MinneapolisStory.com</strong>, where I will make  comments between these weekly columns. And if you have things you would like me  to comment on, send me an <a href="mailto:edwards@beacononthehill.com"><strong>Email at  Edwards@BeaconOnTheHill.com</strong></a>.</p>
