<p><strong>Note that the inscription</strong> above doesn&#146;t say the march &#8220;to&#8221; 
  Washington, but rather the march &#8220;on&#8221; Washington. The best summary 
  is by Nellie Stone Johnson: &#8220;No education, no jobs, no homes.&#8221; The 
  American Dream is to get a good education that enables a good job that earns 
  a good income in order to buy a good home. That is the dream for everyone. Martin 
  Luther King, Jr. served notice that not only was this also the dream for Blacks, 
  but that Blacks were qualifiable for education, jobs, and homes, despite the 
  200 years of slavery, the ensuing 78 years of Jim Crow, and the 35 years of 
  exclusion due to the 1968 Kerner Commission&#146;s conclusion that Blacks can&#146;t 
  make it on their own as other people, without government help. The results of 
  this has been plain for any to see: many have been purposefully and intentionally 
  disqualified and ghettoized on inner city plantations, most created by democrats. 
  In my book I summarize the progress made in my Interludes 5 and 7. But that 
  means only that the glass is half full. For those in the inner city, the glass 
  is half empty: my Interludes 2 and 10. </p>
<p>As the quote from segregationist George Wallace shows, Martin Luther King, 
  Jr. found that the Mason-Dixon line stretched, as he put it, across the Canadian 
  border between the two oceans. Other dimensions of the Black struggle are covered 
  in my book and in the Solution Papers section of my web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. 
  For this paper we pause in the struggle to remember a man unlike any other. 
  No one has come forth like him just as no White man has come forth either. We 
  honor Dr. King and his ideals with a national policy, a holiday, one which Presidents 
  of the Democratic Party refused to sign, a holiday signed into law by the Republican, 
  Ronald Reagan. Times have changed. 25% of young Blacks today under 30 consider 
  themselves Independents, not Democrats or Republicans. They are a fertile ground 
  for voters. I encourage them to vote in every election. And I encourage them 
  to vote for which ever party keeps its eye on the prize of freedom for all, 
  Black and White. </p>
<p>Clearly, there are those of us who won&#146;t take our eyes off the prize, 
  won&#146;t support any political party &#8220;just because,&#8221; won&#146;t 
  stop marching, and won&#146;t stop dreaming, until, with Amazing Grace, we find 
  that not only We shall overcome, we will have overcome. The march continues. 
  And then we&#146;ll dream new dreams. And we will continue to march for justice 
  and fairness for all, which means not equal results for all but equal access 
  and equal opportunity for all.</p>
<p>The problem we face today is the hijacking of the civil rights movement from 
  its historic purpose of righting the wrongs done to slaves to now incorporating 
  everyone with a grievance, including new immigrants. The de jure Jim Crow laws 
  are gone. But the defacto Jim Crow laws, especially those of America&#146;s 
  inner city ghettoes, remain, and they have nothing to do with gender, sexual 
  orientation, the disabled nor the environment. Perhaps the crack in the movement 
  began with the moral crusade against the Vietnam War, which opened the door 
  to other worthy causes, real and imagined.</p>
<p>Dr. King reminds us that the civil rights movement was about righting historic 
  wrongs that left too many Blacks as well as Whites in poverty and hopelessness 
  and little or no education. To raise others out of poverty and underemployment 
  means Blacks must be raised if not first, then simultaneously. He opposed any, 
  Black or White, who said things were going too fast or that they should wait. 
  Indeed, he wrote a book entitled &#8220;Why We Can&#146;t Wait.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is why I chose, for my book&#146;s Interlude 4, &#8220;The Greatest Quartet&#8221;: &#8220;We can make it on our own&#8221; George Washington Carver, &#8220;But let&#146;s 
  make it happen now&#8221; W.E.B. DuBois, &#8220;I have a dream for all&#8221; Martin 
  Luther King, Jr., and &#8220;We will make the law serve everyone&#8221; Thurgood 
  Marshall.</p>
<p>Despite the historic passages of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights 
  Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, these were essentially canceled 
  for inner city ghetto Blacks by the liberal ideology of the Democrats and their 
  1998 Kerner Commission Report which stalled both the educational and economic 
  agenda for enabling Blacks to close the historic gap with Whites by declaring 
  that Blacks were not like other people and thus could not make it on their own 
  (as, for examples, immigrants did). Blacks &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; in the inner 
  city ghettoes of lower classes are in double binds regarding their value. My 
  goal is to work with the poor in the inner cities so that both, Black and White, 
  emerge with the prize in sight of the freedom that allows equal access and equal 
  opportunity in education, jobs, and housing, as well as in political participation 
  and entrepreneurial growth such that equal access and equal opportunity leads 
  them to the social, economic, political and community mainstream. </p>
<p>And now, let us remember the prize and the cost of running the race to achieve 
  that prize, as we are reminded to keep on striving, in these words from Dr. 
  Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p><strong>Letter from the Birmingham Jail<br>
  </strong>April 16, 1963<br>
  http://almaz.com/nobel/peace/MLK-jail.html</p>
<p>MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN:<br>
  While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement 
  calling my present activities &#8220;unwise and untimely.&#8221; Seldom do I pause 
  to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms 
  that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other 
  than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time 
  for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will 
  and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your 
  statements in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms. </p>
<p>&#8230;I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of 
  the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their &#8220;thus saith 
  the Lord&#8221; far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the 
  Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ 
  to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the 
  gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond 
  to the Macedonian call for aid.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. 
  I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. 
  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable 
  network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects 
  one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with 
  the narrow, provincial &#8220;outside agitator&#8221; idea. Anyone who lives inside 
  the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.</p>
<p>&#8230;It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, 
  but it is even more unfortunate that the city&#8217;s white power structure 
  left the Negro community with no alternative. </p>
<p>In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts 
  to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self-purification; and direct 
  action. We have gone through these steps in Birmingham&#8230;Negro leaders sought 
  to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage 
  in good-faith negotiation.</p>
<p>As in so many past experiences, our hopes bad been blasted, and the shadow 
  of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare 
  for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying 
  our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful 
  of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. 
  We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves 
  : &#8220;Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?&#8221; &#8220;Are you 
  able to endure the ordeal of jail?&#8221; We decided to schedule our direct-action 
  program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is 
  the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic with withdrawal 
  program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this would be 
  the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.</p>
<p>&#8230;You may well ask: &#8220;Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and 
  so forth? Isn&#8217;t negotiation a better path?&#8221; You are quite right 
  in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. 
  Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension 
  that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront 
  the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. 
  My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister 
  may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word 
  &#8220;tension.&#8221; I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is 
  a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just 
  as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that 
  individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered 
  realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must see the need for 
  nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help 
  men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights 
  of understanding and brotherhood.</p>
<p>&#8230;I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has 
  our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue 
  rather than dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8230;Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give 
  up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily 
  give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups 
  tend to be more immoral than individuals.</p>
<p>We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given 
  by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet 
  to engage in a direct-action campaign that was &#8220;well timed&#8221; in the 
  view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. 
  For years now I have heard the word &#8220;Wait!&#8221; It rings in the ear of 
  every Negro with piercing familiarity. This &#8220;Wait&#8221; has almost always 
  meant &#8216;Never.&#8221; We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, 
  that &#8220;justice too long delayed is justice denied.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given 
  rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet like speed toward 
  gaining political independence, but we stiff creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward 
  gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who 
  have never felt the stinging dark of segregation to say, &#8220;Wait.&#8221; But 
  when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown 
  your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen 
  curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the 
  vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight 
  cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find 
  your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your 
  six-year-old daughter why she can&#8217;t go to the public amusement park that has 
  just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when 
  she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds 
  of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning 
  to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white 
  people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: &#8220;Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?&#8221;; when you 
  take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in 
  the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; 
  when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading &#8220;white&#8221; 
  and &#8220;colored&#8221;; when your first name becomes &#8220;nigger,&#8221; your 
  middle name becomes &#8220;boy&#8221; (however old you are) and your last name 
  becomes &#8220;John,&#8221; and your wife and mother are never given the respected 
  title &#8220;Mrs.&#8221;; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by 
  the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite 
  knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; 
  when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of &#8220;nobodiness&#8221; 
  then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time 
  when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged 
  into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and 
  unavoidable impatience.</p>
<p>&#8230;One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. 
  Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree 
  with St. Augustine that &#8220;an unjust law is no law at all&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether 
  a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the 
  moral law or the law of God&#8230;An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted 
  in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. 
  Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes 
  are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. 
  It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false 
  sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher 
  Martin Buber, substitutes an &#8220;I-it&#8221; relationship for an &#8220;I-thou&#8221; 
  relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation 
  is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally 
  wrong and awful. Paul Tillich said that sin is separation. Is not segregation 
  an existential expression &#8216;of man&#8217;s tragic separation, his awful 
  estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey 
  the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge 
  them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.</p>
<p>&#8230;In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid 
  segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must 
  do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit 
  that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and 
  who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience 
  of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect 
  for law.</p>
<p>&#8230;To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced 
  civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive 
  act of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>&#8230;I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. 
  First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed 
  with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that 
  the Negro&#8217;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not 
  the White Citizen&#8217;s Council or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, 
  who is more devoted to &#8220;order&#8221; than to justice; who prefers a negative 
  peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence 
  of justice; who constantly says: &#8220;I agree with you in the goal you seek, 
  but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&#8221;; who paternalistically 
  believes he can set the timetable for another man&#8217;s freedom; who lives 
  by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for 
  a &#8220;more convenient season.&#8221; Shallow understanding from people of 
  good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of 
  ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>
<p>&#8230;We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. 
  We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil 
  that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with 
  an its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be 
  exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience 
  and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.</p>
<p>&#8230;More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much 
  more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in 
  this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people 
  but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls 
  in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men 
  willing to be co-workers with God, and without this &#8216;hard work, time itself 
  becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.</p>
<p>&#8230;Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform 
  our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the 
  time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to 6e 
  solid rock of human dignity.</p>
<p>&#8230;a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result 
  of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense of &#8220;somebodiness&#8221; 
  that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle class Negroes 
  who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some 
  ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of 
  the masses.</p>
<p>&#8230;If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, 
  one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The 
  Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release 
  them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let 
  him go on freedom rides-and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed 
  emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through 
  violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to 
  my people: &#8220;Get rid of your discontent.&#8221; Rather, I have tried to 
  say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative 
  outlet of nonviolent direct action.</p>
<p>&#8230;But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, 
  as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction 
  from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: &#8220;Love your enemies, 
  bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them 
  which despitefully use you, and persecute you.&#8221; Was not Amos an extremist 
  for justice: &#8220;Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like 
  an ever-flowing stream.&#8221; Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: 
  &#8220;I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&#8221; Was not Martin 
  Luther an extremist: &#8220;Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me 
  God.&#8221; And John Bunyan: &#8220;I will stay in jail to the end of my days 
  before I make a butchery of my conscience.&#8221; And Abraham Lincoln: &#8220;This 
  nation cannot survive half slave and half free.&#8221; And Thomas Jefferson: 
  &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that an men are created equal&#8230;&#8221; 
  So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists 
  we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremist 
  for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic 
  scene on Calvary&#8217;s hill three men were crucified. We must never forget 
  that all three were crucified for the same crime&#8212;the crime of extremism. 
  Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The 
  other, Jeans Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby 
  rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are 
  in dire need of creative extremists.</p>
<p>&#8230;[Whites] have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They 
  have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality 
  of policemen who view them as &#8220;dirty nigger lovers.&#8221; Unlike so many 
  of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of 
  the moment and sensed the need for powerful &#8220;action&#8221; antidotes to 
  combat the disease of segregation.</p>
<p>I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers 
  to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed 
  to hear white ministers declare: &#8220;Follow this decree because integration 
  is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.&#8221; In the midst of 
  blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen 
  stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities 
  in the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice. 
</p>
<p>&#8230;Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement 
  that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police 
  force for keeping &#8220;order&#8221; and &#8220;preventing violence.&#8221; 
  I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had 
  seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt 
  that you would so quickly commend the policemen if .you were to observe their 
  ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to 
  watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were 
  to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe 
  them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted 
  to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham 
  police department.</p>
<p>&#8230;One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of 
  God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is 
  best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian 
  heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy 
  which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution 
  and the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>&#8230;Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass 
  away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched 
  communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love 
  and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating 
  beauty. </p>
<p>Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood, </p>

<p><strong>The Playboy Interview: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.<br>
  </strong> a candid conversation with the Nobel prize-winning leader of the civil 
  rights movement<br>
  Playboy Magazine, January 1965, pp. 65-78<br>
  http://www.bolerium.com/cgi-bin/bol48/41888.html </p>
<p>From the Playboy introduction<br>
  &#8230;became world renowned as a champion of Gandhi&#146;s philosophy of passive 
  resistance&#8230;at 27 on the front lines of a nonviolent Negro revolution against 
  racial injustice&#8230;By the end of that &#8220;long hot summer&#8221; [of 
  1963], American Negroes had won more tangible gains than in any year since 1865&#8230;he 
  works 20 hours a day, travels 325,000 miles and makes 450 speeches a year throughout 
  the country on behalf of the Negro cause. </p>
<p>The three excerpts chosen for the first page picture sequence:<br> &#8220;Measures must be taken at the Federal level to curb the reign of terror 
  in the South. It&#146;s getting so anybody can kill a Negro and get away with 
  it, as long as they go through the motions of a trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#146;m getting sick and tired of people saying that this movement has 
  been infiltrated b Communists. There are as many Communists in this freedom 
  movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nobel award recognizes the amazing discipline of the Negro. Though 
  we have had riots, the bloodshed we would have known without the discipline 
  of nonviolence would have been frightening</p>
<p>Excerpts from the interview (conducted by Alex Haley, who kept framing questions 
  in terms of Negroes and King responded in terms of the poor and downtrodden, 
  Black and White):<br> &#8220;Well the most pervasive mistake I have made was in believing that because 
  our cause was just, we could be sure that the white ministers of the South, 
  once their Christian consciences were challenged, would rise to our aid. I felt 
  that white ministers would take our cause to the white power structures. I ended 
  up, of course, chastened and disillusioned. As our movement unfolded, and direct 
  appeals were made to white ministers, most folded their hands and some even 
  took stands against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The projection of a social gospel, in my opinion, is the true witness 
  of a Christian life. This is the meaning of the true life. This is the meaning 
  of the true ecclesia &#150; the inner, spiritual church. The church once changed 
  society. It was then a thermostat of society. But today I feel that too much 
  of the [white] church is merely a thermometer, which measures rather than molds 
  popular opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were their voices when a black race took upon itself the cross 
  of protest against man&#146;s injustice to man? Where were their voices when 
  defiance and hatred were called for by white men who sat in these very churches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For never in Christian history within a Christian country, have Christians 
  churches been on the receiving end of such naked brutality and violence as we 
  are witnessing here in America today. Not since the days of the Christians in 
  the catacombs has God&#146;s house, as a symbol, weathered such attack as the 
  Negro churches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the same reasons the slaves sang Negroes today sing freedom songs 
  for we, too, are in bondage. We sing out our determination that, &#145;We shall 
  overcome, black and white together, we shall overcome someday.&#146;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another of the major strengths of the nonviolent weapon is its strange 
  power to transform and transmute the individuals who subordinate themselves 
  to its disciplines, investing them with a cause that is larger than themselves. 
  They become for the firs time, somebody, and they have, for the first time, 
  the courage to be free. When the Negro finds the courage to be free, he faces 
  dogs and guns and clubs and fire hoses totally unafraid, and the white man with 
  those dogs, guns, clubs and fire hoses see that the Negro they have traditionally 
  called &#145;boy&#146; has become a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our white brothers must be made to understand that nonviolence is a weapon 
  fabricated of love. It is a sword that heals. Our nonviolent direct-action program 
  has its objective not the creation of tensions, but he surfacing of tensions 
  already present. We set out to precipitate a crisis situation that must open 
  the door to negotiation. I am not afraid the world &#145;crisis&#146; and &#145;tension.&#146; 
  I deeply oppose violence, but constructive crisis and tension are necessary 
  for growth. Innate in all life, and all growth, is tension. Only in death is 
  there an absence of tension. To cure injustices, you must expose them before 
  the light of human conscience and the bar of public opinion, regardless of whatever 
  tension that exposure generates. Injustices to the Negro must be brought out 
  into the open where they cannot be evaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have five aims: first, to stimulate nonviolent, direct, mass action 
  to expose and remove the barriers of segregation and discrimination; second 
  to disseminate the creative philosophy and techniques of nonviolence through 
  local and area workshops; third, to secure the right and unhampered use of the 
  ballot for every citizen; fourth to achieve full citizenship rights and the 
  total integration of the Negro into American life; and fifth, to reduce the 
  cultural flag through our citizenship training program.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Regarding King&#146;s &#8220;dissatisfaction with the Civil Rights Act resented 
  by many whites who calling the Negro &#145;ungrateful&#146; and &#145;unrealistic&#146; 
  to press his demands for more.] This is a litany to those of us in this field. 
  &#145;What more will the Negro want?&#146; &#145;What will it take to make these 
  demonstrations end?&#146; Well, I would like to reply with another rhetorical 
  question: Why do white people seem to find it so difficult to understand that 
  the Negro is sick and tired of having reluctantly parceled out to him those 
  rights and privileges which all others receive upon birth or entry to America? 
  I never cease to wonder at the amazing presumption of much of white society 
  assuming that they have the right to bargain with the Negro for his freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Few white people even today, will face the clear fact that the very future 
  and destiny of this country are tied up in what answer will be given to the 
  Negro. And that answer must be given soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What little progress has been made &#150; that includes the Civil Rights 
  Act &#150; has applied primarily to the middle-class Negro. Among the masses, 
  especially in the Northern ghettos, the situation remains about the same, and 
  for some it is worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I have been dismayed at the degree to which abysmal 
  ignorance seems to prevail among many state, city, and even Federal officials 
  on the whole question of racial justice and injustice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder at men who dare to feel that they have some paternalistic right 
  to set the timetable for another man&#146;s liberation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when I consider the true meaning of the word, I decided that perhaps 
  I would like to think of myself as an extremist &#150; in the light of the spirit 
  which made Jesus and extremist for love. If it sounds as though I am comparing 
  myself to the Savior, let me remind you that all who honor themselves with the 
  claim of being &#145;Christians&#146; should compare themselves to Jesus. Thus 
  I consider myself an extremist for that brotherhood of man which Paul so nobly 
  expressed: &#145;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, 
  there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#146; 
  Love is the only force on earth that can be dispensed or received in an extreme 
  manner, without any qualifications, without any harm to the giver or the receiver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes &#150; morally if not legally. For there are two kinds of laws; man&#146;s 
  and God&#146;s. A man-made code that squares with the moral law, or the law 
  of God, is a just law. But a man-made code that is inharmonious with the moral 
  law is an unjust law. And an unjust law, as St. Augustine said, is no law at 
  all. Thus a law that is morally null and void, and must be defied until it is 
  legally null and void as well. Let us not forget the memories of 6,000,000 who 
  died, that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was &#145;legal,&#146; and 
  that everything the Freedom Fighters in Hungary did was &#145;illegal.&#146; 
  In spite of that, I am sure that I would have aided and comforted my Jewish 
  brothers if I had lived in Germany during Hitler&#146;s reign, as some Christian 
  priests and ministers did do, often as the cost of their lives. And if I lived 
  now in a communist country where principles dear to the Christian&#146;s faith 
  are suppressed, II know that I would openly advocated defiance of the country&#146;s 
  anti-religious laws &#150; again, just as some Christian priests and ministers 
  are doing today behind the Iron Curtain. Right here in America today there are 
  white ministers, priests and rabbis who have shed blood in the support of our 
  struggle against a web of injustice, much of which is supported by immoral man-made 
  laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the Northern white, having little actual contact with the Negro 
  is devoted to the abstract principle of cordial interracial relations. The North 
  has long considered, in a theoretical way, that it supported brotherhood and 
  the equality of man, but the truth is that deep prejudices and discriminations 
  exist in hidden and subtle and covert disguises. The South&#146;s prejudice 
  and discrimination, on the other hand, has been applied against the Negro in 
  obvious, open, overt and glaring forms &#150; which make the problem easier 
  to get at. The Southern white man has the advantage of far more actual contact 
  with Negroes than the Northerner. A major problem is that this contract has 
  been paternalistic and poisoned by the myth of racial superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Regarding his response to the fact that many Southern whites vow that white 
  racial superiority &#150; and the Negro inferiority &#150; are a biological 
  fact, King said] You may remember that during the rise of Nazi Germany, a rash 
  of books by respected German scientists appeared, supporting the master-race 
  theory. This utterly ignorant fallacy has been so thoroughly refuted by the 
  social scientists, as well as by medical science, that any individual who goes 
  on believing that it is standing in an absolutely misguided and diminishing 
  circle. The American Anthropological Association has unanimously adopted a resolution 
  repudiating statements that Negroes are biologically, in innate mental ability 
  or in any other way inferior to whites. Thee collective weight and authority 
  of world scientists are embodied in an UNESCO report on races which flatly refutes 
  the theory of innate superiority among any ethnic group. And as far as Negro 
  &#145;blood&#146; is concerned, medical science finds the same four blood types 
  in all race groups. </p>
<p>When the Southern white finally accepts this simple fact &#150; as he eventually 
  must &#150; beautiful results will follow, for we will have come a long way 
  toward transforming his master-servant perspective into a person-to-person perspective. 
  The Southern man, discovering the &#145;nonmyth&#146; Negro, exhibits all the 
  passion of the new convert, seeing the black man as a man among men for the 
  first time. The South, if it is to survive economically, must make dramatic 
  changes, and these must included the Negro. People of good will in the South, 
  who are the vast majority, have the challenge to be open and honest, and to 
  turn a deaf ear on the shrill cries of the irresponsible few of the lunatic 
  fringe. I think and pray they will.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they had been, there would have been no riot, for we believe that 
  only just means may be used in seeking a just end. We believe that lasting gains 
  can be made &#150; and they have been made &#150; only by practicing what we 
  preach: a policy of nonviolent, peaceful protest. The riots, North and South, 
  have involved mobs &#150; not the disciplined, nonviolent, direct-action demonstrators 
  with whom I identify. We do not condone lawlessness, looting and violence committed 
  by the racist or the reckless of any color.</p>
<p>I must say, however, that riots such as have occurred do achieve at least one 
  partially positive effect: They dramatically focus national attention upon the 
  Negro&#146;s discontent. Unfortunately, they also give the white majority an 
  excuse, a provocation, to look away from the cause of the riots &#150; the poverty 
  and the deprivation and the degradation off the Negro, especially in the slums 
  and ghettos where the riots occur &#150; and to talk instead of looting, and 
  of the breakdown of law and order. It is never circulated that some of the looters 
  have been white people, similarly motivated by their own poverty. In one riot 
  in a Northern city, aside from the Negroes and Puerto Ricans who were arrested, 
  there were also 158 white people &#150; including mothers stealing food, children&#146;s 
  shoes and other necessity items. They poor, white and black, were rebelling 
  together against the establishment.</p>
<p>By &#145;establishment&#146; I mean the white leadership &#150; which I hold 
  as responsible as anyone for the riots, for not removing the conditions that 
  cause them. The deep frustration, the seething desperation of the Negro today 
  is a product of slum housing, chronic poverty, woefully inadequate education 
  and substandard schools. The Negro is trapped in a long and desolate corridor 
  with no exit sign, caught in a vicious socioeconomic vise. And he is ostracized 
  as is no other minority group in America by the evil of oppressive and constricting 
  prejudice based solely upon his color. A righteous man has no alternative but 
  to resist such an evil system. If he does not have the courage to resist nonviolently, 
  then he runs the risk of a violent emotional explosion. As much as I deplore 
  violence, there is one evil that is worse than violence, and that&#146;s cowardice. 
  It is still my basic article of faith that social justice can be achieved and 
  democracy advanced only to the degree that there is firm adherence to nonviolent 
  action and resistance in the pursuit of social justice. But America will be 
  faced with the ever-present threat of violence, rioting and senseless crime 
  as long as Negroes by the hundreds of thousands are packed into malodorous, 
  rat-plagued ghettos; as long as negroes remain smothered by poverty in the midst 
  of an affluent society; as long as Negroes are made to feel like exiles in their 
  own land; as long as Negroes continue to be dehumanized; as long as negroes 
  see their freedom endlessly delayed and diminished by the head winds of tokenism 
  and small handouts from the white power structure. No nation can suffer any 
  great tragedy than to cause millions of its citizens to feel that they have 
  no stake in their own society.</p>
<p>Understand that I am trying only to explain the reasons for violence and the 
  threat of violence. Let me say again that by on means under no circumstance 
  do I condone outbreaks of looting and lawlessness. I feel that every responsible 
  Negro leader must point out, with all possible vigor, that anyone who perpetrates 
  and participates in a riot is immoral as well as impractical &#150; that the 
  use of immoral means will not achieve the moral end of racial justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He remains throttled, as he has always been, by vague, intangible economic 
  and social deprivations. Until the concerned power structures begin to grapple 
  creatively with these fundamental inequities, it will be difficult for violence 
  to be eliminated. The longer our people see no progress, or halting progress, 
  the easier it will be for them to yield to the counsels of hatred and demagoguery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Negro across America, looking at his television set, sees black statesmen 
  voting in the United Nations on vital world issues, knowing that in many of 
  America&#146;s cities, he himself is not yet permitted to place his ballot. 
  The Negro hears of black kings and potentates ruling in palaces, while he remains 
  ghettoized in urban slums. It is only natural that Negroes would react to this 
  extreme irony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence is not going to solve our problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Negro revolution is seeking integration, no independence. Those 
  fighting for independence have the purpose to drive out the oppressors. But 
  here in America, we&#146;ve got to live together. We&#146;ve got to find a way 
  to reconcile ourselves to living in community, one group with the other. The 
  struggle of the Negro in America, to be successful, must be waged with resolute 
  efforts, but efforts that are kept strictly within the framework of our democratic 
  society. This means reaching, educating, and moving large enough groups of people 
  of both races to stir the conscience of the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All major industrial ghetto areas should establish serious biracial discussions 
  of community problems, and of ways to begin solving them. Instead of ambulance 
  service, municipal leaders need to provide preventative medicine. Secondly, 
  these communities should make serious efforts to provide work and training for 
  unemployed youth, through job-and-training programs such as the HARYOU-ACT program 
  in New York City. Thirdly, all cities concerned should make first-priority efforts 
  to provide immediate quality education for Negro youth &#150; instead of conducting 
  studies for the next five years. Young boys and girls now in the ghettos must 
  be enabled to feel that they count, that somebody cares about them; they must 
  be able to feel hope. And on a longer-range basis, the physical ghetto itself 
  must be eliminated, because these are the environmental conditions that germinate 
  riots. It is both socially and morally suicidal to continue a pattern of deploring 
  effects while failing to come to grips with the causes. Ultimately, law and 
  order will be maintained only when justice and dignity are accorded impartially 
  to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am positive, moreover, that the money spent would be more than amply 
  justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular 
  decline in school dropouts family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen 
  relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another example is the fact that after World war Two, the years when 
  it became policy to build and maintain the largest military machine that would 
  has ever known, America also took upon itself, through the Marshall Plan and 
  other measures, the financial relief and rehabilitation of millions of European 
  people. If American can afford to underwrite its allies and ex-enemies, it can 
  certainly afford &#150; and has a much great obligation, as I see it &#150; 
  to do at least as well by its own no-less-needy countrymen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is economic fact that a program such as I propose would certainly 
  cost far less than any computation of two centuries of unpaid wages plus accumulated 
  interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not intend that this program of economic aid should apply only to 
  the Negro: it should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The closest analogy is the GI Bill of Rights. Negro rehabilitation in 
  America would require approximately the same breadth of program&#8212;which 
  would not place an undue burden on our economy. Just as was the case with the 
  returning soldier, such a bill for the disadvantaged and impoverished could 
  enable them to buy homes without cash, at lower and easier repayment terms. 
  They could negotiate loans from banks to launch businesses. They could receive, 
  as did ex-GIs, special points to place them ahead in competition for civil service 
  jobs. Under certain circumstances of physical disability, medical care and long-term 
  financial grants could be made available. And together wit these rights, a favorable 
  social could be created to encourage the preferential employment of the disadvantaged, 
  as was the case so many years with veterans. During those years, it might be 
  noted, there was no appreciable resentment of the preferential treatment being 
  given to the special group. America was only compensating her veterans for their 
  time lost from school or from business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must develop a Federal program of public works, retraining and jobs 
  for all &#150; so that none, white or black, will have cause to feel threatened. 
  At the present time, thousands of jobs a week are disappearing for the wake 
  of automation and other production efficiency techniques. Black and white, we 
  will all be harmed unless something grand and imaginative is done. The unemployed, 
  poverty-stricken white man must be made to realize that he is in the very same 
  boat with the Negro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must expunge from our society the myths and half-truths that engender 
  such groundless fears as these. In the first place, there is no truth to the 
  myth that Negroes depreciate property. The fact is that most Negroes are kept 
  out of residential neighborhoods so long that when one of us is finally sold 
  a home, it&#8217;s already depreciated. In the second place, we must dispel the negative 
  and harmful atmosphere that has been created by avaricious and unprincipled 
  realtors who engage in &#8220;blockbusting.&#8221; If we had in America really 
  serious efforts to break down discrimination in housing, and at the same time 
  a concerted program of Government aid to improve housing for Negroes, I think 
  many white people would be surprised at how many Negroes would choose to live 
  among themselves, exactly as Poles and Jews and other ethnic groups do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But with the Negro slavery separated families from families, and the 
  pattern of disunity that we see among Negroes today derives directly from this 
  cruel fact of history. It is also a cruel fact of history that the Negro, generally 
  speaking, has not developed a responsible sense of financial values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Negroes, who amount to about 11 percent of the American population, are 
  reported to consume about 40 percent of the Scotch whisky imported into the 
  U.S. and to spend over $72,000,000 a year in jewelry stores. So when we come 
  asking for civil right donations, or help for the United Negro College Fund, 
  most Negroes are trying to make ends meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be impossible to record the contribution that the Jewish people 
  have made toward the Negro&#146;s struggle for freedom &#150; it has been so 
  great.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Regarding the data showing that only one Negro in ten has ever participated 
  physically in any form of social protest.] It is significant, I think, that 
  during each of our city struggles, the usual average of crimes committed by 
  Negroes has dropped to almost nothing.</p>
<p>But it is true, undeniably, that there are many Negroes who will never fight 
  for freedom &#150; yet who will be eager enough to accept it when it comes. 
  And there are million so of Negroes who have never known anything but oppression, 
  who are so devoid of pride and self-respect that they have resigned themselves 
  to segregation. Other Negroes, comfortable and complacent, consider that they 
  are above the struggle of the masses. And still others seek personal profit 
  from segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My only salary is from my church, $4000 a year, plus $2000 more a year 
  for what is known as &#145;pastoral care.&#146; To earn a grand total of about 
  $10,000 a year, I keep about $4,000 to $5,000 a year for myself from the honorariums 
  that I receive from various peaking engagements. About 90 percent of myth speaking 
  is from S.C.L.C. and it brings into our treasury something around $200,000 a 
  year. Additionally, I get a fairly sizable but fluctuation income in the form 
  of royalties from my writings. But all of this, too, I give to my church, or 
  to my alma mater, Morehouse College, here in Atlanta. </p>
<p>I believe as sincerely as I believe anything that the struggle for freedom 
  in which S.C.L.C. is engaged is not one that should reward any participant with 
  individual wealth and gain. I think I&#146;d rise up in my grave if I died leaving 
  two or three hundred thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Constitution were today applied equally and impartially to all 
  o America&#146;s citizens, in every section of the country, in every court and 
  code of law, there would be no need for any group of citizens to seek extralegal 
  redress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Reinhold Niebuhr has written, individuals may see the moral light 
  and voluntarily abandon their unjust posture, but groups tend to be more immoral, 
  and more intransigent, than individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Similarly, not long ago, I toured in eight communities of the state 
  of Mississippi. And I have carried with me ever since a visual image of the 
  penniless and unlettered, and of the expressions on their faces &#150; of deep 
  and courageous determination to cast off the imprint of the past and become 
  free people. I welcome the opportunity to be a part of this great drama, for 
  it is a drama that will determine America&#146;s destiny. IF the problem is 
  not solved, America will be on the road to self-destruction. But if it is solved, 
  America will just as surely be on the high road of the fulfillment of the founding 
  fathers&#146; dream, when they wrote: &#145;We hold these truths to be self 
  evident&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts from Martin Luther King&#146;s &#8220;I Have A Dream&#8221; 
  speech:</strong></p>
<p>August 28, 1963, on the steps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed 
  the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon 
  light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames 
  of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of 
  captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the 
  Negro is still not free. </p>
<p>One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the 
  manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years 
  later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast 
  ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing 
  in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. 
</p>
<p>So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition. In a sense 
  we have come to our nation&#8217;s capital to cash a check. When the architects of 
  our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration 
  of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American 
  was to fall heir. </p>
<p>This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights 
  of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America 
  has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. 
  Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people 
  a bad check, which has come back marked &#8220;insufficient funds.&#8221; But 
  we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe 
  that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this 
  nation. </p>
<p>So we have come to cash this check&#8212;a check that will give us upon demand 
  the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this 
  hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time 
  to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of 
  gradualism. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation 
  to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity 
  to all of God&#8217;s children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands 
  of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. </p>
<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and 
  to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the 
  Negro&#8217;s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn 
  of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. 
  Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content 
  will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There 
  will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his 
  citizenship rights. </p>
<p>The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation 
  until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must 
  say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace 
  of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty 
  of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking 
  from the cup of bitterness and hatred. </p>
<p>We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. 
  We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. 
  Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force 
  with soul force. </p>
<p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not 
  lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as 
  evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny 
  is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. 
</p>
<p>We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall 
  march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees 
  of civil rights, &#8220;When will you be satisfied?&#8221; we can never be satisfied 
  as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging 
  in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied 
  as long as the Negro&#8217;s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. 
  We can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and 
  a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are 
  not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters 
  and righteousness like a mighty stream. </p>
<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and 
  tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of you have 
  come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms 
  of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been 
  the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned 
  suffering is redemptive. </p>
<p>Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to 
  Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing 
  that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the 
  valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties 
  and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted 
  in the American dream. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
  meaning of its creed: &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all 
  men are created equal.&#8221; I have a dream that one day on the red hills of 
  Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be 
  able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one 
  day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat 
  of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and 
  justice. I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation 
  where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content 
  of their character. I have a dream today. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor&#8217;s lips are 
  presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be 
  transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be 
  able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together 
  as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every 
  valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough 
  places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and 
  the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. 
  This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this 
  faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. 
  With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation 
  into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to 
  work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, 
  to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. </p>
<p>This will be the day when all of God&#8217;s children will be able to sing with a 
  new meaning, &#8220;My country, &#8216;tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee 
  I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim&#8217;s pride, from every 
  mountainside, let freedom ring.&#8221; And if America is to be a great nation, 
  this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New 
  Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom 
  ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring from 
  the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado! Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks 
  of California! But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia! 
  Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee! Let freedom ring from every 
  hill and every molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom 
  ring. </p>
<p>When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every 
  hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day 
  when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants 
  and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro 
  spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free 
  at last!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts from &#8220;The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes<br>
  </strong> by Ron Edwards, October 2002 </p>
<p>I am not one of those. I still believe in the American ideal, in the American 
  dream of freedom and liberty for all. (p. 8)</p>
<p>Now we have a new season of Jim Crow, more clever and better disguised, that 
  is a counter-movement to return to the Civil Rights Movement. That is now happening 
  in Minneapolis with a vengeance. Hence, I write this book. My dream is that 
  we can finally achieve a season of content. That is my dream. It was the dream 
  of Martin Luther King, Jr. I know that you, the reader, have a dream. Above, 
  I quote john a. powell on our capacity to dream. But before we can dream the 
  best for Minneapolis, we have to step back and be dispassionate about what has 
  prevented our dreams. Then we can be passionate about achieving our dream of 
  justice and fairness and equal access and opportunity for all. We need to find 
  the truth of the past in order to build an honest future. It will take a lot 
  of connecting the dots to do so. We need to understand the chessboard of Minneapolis 
  and how no matter what move we make, the powers make two, constantly pursuing 
  their goal of putting us under checkmate. (p. 16)</p>
<p>In my Conclusion, I recite why and how the negatives can be turned to positives, 
  and provide my vision, my dream, and my prayer of hope for Minneapolis. I envision 
  a dream and encourage us all to work together to sustain our dreams to stand 
  tall and free. (p. 23)</p>
<p>Aren&#146;t we taught that it is the pioneer spirit that made America, the 
  spirit of people unafraid to brave the unknown in pursuit of their dreams? (p. 
  27)</p>
<p>My dream then, as now, was to make a difference, to advocate the American dream 
  for all: truth, justice, fairness, and economic integration into the economic, 
  political, and social mainstream by all people of poverty. (p. 50)</p>
<p>These influences are at work throughout this book, as they have influenced 
  me for 40 years, as I work to make a difference, to advocate the American dream 
  for all. For over 40 years, I have never strayed from this vision. I have tasted 
  defeat and I have tasted reform. But always, the goal was the thing. (p. 56)</p>
<p>Shelby Steele calls it what he titled his book: A Dream Deferred: The Second 
  Betrayal of Black Freedom in America. (p. 57)</p>
<p>Our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Amendments are what have given us the 
  chance to continue to fight the good fight and pursue the American Dream even 
  in the presence of those who would prevent us from doing so. (p. 63)</p>
<p>Booker T. Washington. &#8220;Pragmatist.&#8221; Born in slavery in 1856, he 
  set out to enable Black men to achieve and succeed despite the White man&#146;s 
  yoke (wrote Up From Slavery). Booker T. Washington was an educator, reformer 
  and the most influential black leader of his time (1856-1915). He preached a 
  philosophy of self-help, racial solidarity and accommodation. His preferential 
  option was for the poor, and to turn the unqualified but qualifiable into the 
  qualified. In his book, Booker T. Washington observes, &#8220;Among a large 
  class [of Blacks] there seemed to be a dependence upon the Government for every 
  conceivable thing. The members of this class had little ambition to create a 
  position for themselves, but wanted the Federal officials to create one for 
  them.&#8221; This is continued today by the&#8230;the NAACP. Booker T. Washington 
  urged Blacks to &#8220;cast down your buckets&#8221; and acquire the skills 
  and capital needed to start at the bottom instead of looking to government for 
  help. (pp. 37-38)</p>
<p>W.E.B. DuBois, &#8220;civil rights activist.&#8221; Born a freeman in Boston, 
  in 1868, and died in 1963, was a passionate fighter for full civil rights and 
  equality of citizenship for the Negro. He had helped found the NAACP but had 
  broken with it in 1948 because of its timidity. So you can see my concern with 
  the NAACP&#8230;as I discuss in Chapter 14, is not a new one. He was not for 
  gradualism at all. DuBois dreamed of creating a &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; 
  that would supply the leadership necessary to winning rights and full equality 
  for the Negro. He wanted to fill &#8220;the central problem of training men 
  for life,&#8221; which Washington wanted as well. I maintain that it is precisely 
  for this reason that Whites have sabotaged Black education (Chapter 7) so they 
  would not attain full rights and equality (Chapters 8-9). (p. 87)</p>
<p>Martin Luther King&#8230;taught the moral high ground, he lived where people 
  lived, he spent time in jail, as St. Paul did, and he helped turn the dream 
  into a reality. His dream is still the dream of all good people. The question 
  remains how to achieve the dream. We need to remind ourselves of his dream, 
  read it, make it our own, and figure out how to make it come true&#8230;We need 
  to remind ourselves of his dream, read it, make it our own, and figure out how 
  to make it come true. His 1963 speech, with excerpts below, are as relevant 
  today as they were 40 years ago. (p. 88).</p>
<p>Thurgood Marshall. &#8220;Defender of the oppressed.&#8221; He was the gavel 
  announcing justice and getting legal action in the halls of justice. He argued 
  before the Supreme Court the legal case for making the dream legal, striking 
  the de facto slave laws and instituting the de jure freedom laws. (p. 88)</p>

<p>Many Blacks have remained faithful to the dream. We don&#146;t want to give 
  up nor give in, although some do. There are still enough of us willing to do 
  what it takes to overcome hardship and adversity, to achieve the triumph of 
  our own human spirit. What we want now is to instill the dream of Martin Luther 
  King, Jr. in both Liberal politics and Black organizational sell-outs that have 
  caused it to be either driven out or seen as not achievable. (p. 309)</p>
<p>But how else can we inspire our youth to understand that Blacks not only can 
  make and hold wealth and property, but that they have, and did so back when 
  the climate for such success was far worse that it is today. We overcame then. 
  We must get our youth to understand that we can overcome now. They must be made 
  to see that they can overcome now, as so many Blacks before them, if we continue 
  to accept them and push them to do so, using the dream of Martin Luther King, 
  Jr. as a beacon, demonstrating to them that it is not government programs and 
  subsidies that are needed long term, but that we need government protection 
  and assurance to guarantee to equal access and equal opportunity. (p. 312)</p>
