    <p>December 28, 2005 Column #26: Best of &#8220;Through My Eyes&#8221; in 2005: 
      Minneapolis still trying to teach America how to keep us 
      in our place</p>
    <p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
    <p>We continue to report &#8220;through my eyes,&#8221; often scooping major 
      daily and weekly papers regarding our communities of color. That saddens 
      more than gladdens, for it means that their agenda doesn&#8217;t include 
      telling our truths as they play the &#8220;see no evil, hear no evil, and 
      thus report no evil&#8221; game.</p>
    <p>This underscores the great need in Minneapolis for the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> 
      to give voice to our community through its reporting and its columns, a 
      voice still denied by White Minneapolis media and other Black weeklies. 
    </p>
    <p>John F. Kennedy said, &#8220;Efforts and courage are not enough without 
      purpose and direction.&#8221; Our sixth president, John Quincy Adams, said 
      take &#8220;actions [to] inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, 
      and become more.&#8221; We have done this through our columns and our &#8220;solution 
      papers&#8221; on behalf of the &#8220;remnant&#8221; of the communities 
      of color in Minneapolis and for any that are still waiting for full inclusion 
      in terms of equal access and equal opportunity. </p>
    <p>Our columns, web log, and &#8220;solution papers&#8221; track Black gaps 
      in seven areas: education, jobs, housing, public safety, environmental safety, 
      governing and ethics, with special attention on the state of emergency for 
      Black inner-city adult men and young men. </p>
    <p>Our columns, web log, and solution papers are posted on our website, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. 
      We advocate fairness, justice and the racial reconciliation needed to enable 
      all people to acquire assets and build wealth. In terms of the &#8220;four 
      freedoms,&#8221; we report how well we fare in freedom of speech and of 
      religion, and how poorly we fare in freedom from want and from fear, as 
      we continue to work for ways to end the violence in our schools and communities. 
    </p>
    <p>Our overarching themes are, first, how the Plantation Mentality still works 
      to put us in our place, and second, how Minneapolis continues to show America 
      how it is done (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0518c0907">18</a> 
      on Katrina&#8217;s aftermath in New Orleans). We resist both.</p>
    <p>We continue Nellie Stone Johnson&#8217;s fight against what she called 
      the &#8220;culture of welfare dependency&#8221; and what it has done to 
      our young men. We have stood up for our adult Black men and Black young 
      men, even when they themselves would not or could not (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0503c0210">3</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0504c0224">4</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0506c0323">6</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0513c0629">13</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0514c0713">14</a>). 
      Too many have lapsed into either a learned helplessness or have transformed 
      into passive men seeking handouts for keeping their place serving the Minneapolis 
      Plantation.</p>
    <p>Our columns have exposed how the City regularly and openly works to choke 
      off Black economic development, individuals and organizations, in both the 
      private and public sectors, in City job compliance failure (<strong>Column</strong> 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0514c0713" target="_blank">14</a>), 
      Enterprise Zones that exclude Blacks (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0522c1102">22</a>), 
      and shutting down Black-owned MPI (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0525c1214" target="_blank">25</a>).</p>
    <p>We reported on how Black individuals, elected representatives, and private 
      citizens were put back in their place, as with MPS Superintendent Peebles 
      (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0514c0713">14</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0517c0824">17</a>), 
      faith community leaders (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0519c0921">19</a>), 
      Black police (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0520c1002">20</a>), 
      Natalie Johnson Lee (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0523c1116">23</a>) 
      and Neva Walker (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0525c1214">25</a>).</p>
    <p>We reported the parade of injustice to Ronald Reed and Larry Clark (<strong>Columns</strong> 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0507c0406">7</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0516c0810">16</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0517c0824">17</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0519c0921">19</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0520c1002">20</a>, 
      and <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0524c1130">24</a>).    </p>
    <p>As a past head of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission (1967-1983), 
      I have sadly reported its transformation into an organization that now co-opts 
      The Dream (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q3.htm#0515c0727">15</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0525c1214">25</a>).</p>
    <p>We were the only ones in town to stand up for our Vikings brothers (<strong>Columns</strong> 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0502c0126">2</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0522c1102">22</a>) 
      and the only voice in Minneapolis to stand up for a new first: a Black NFL 
      owner (Columns <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0504c0224">4</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0505c0309">5</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0511c0601">11</a>). 
      Related to this was our report on anti-Semitism (<strong>Column</strong> 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0521c1019">21</a>).    </p>
    <p>Two new questions arise: First, why no coverage in Twin 
      Cities newspapers of our hometown athletic hero, the Arizona Cardinals wide 
      receiver phenom Larry Fitzgerald, Jr.?</p>
    <p>Second, who is pressuring State Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. 
      Paul) to demand public punishment of the four Black Vikings charged for 
      partying on a private boating excursion with other consenting adults in 
      acts that have yet to be proven, an almost hauntingly 1935-style of ignoring 
      due process and dismissing the &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221; 
      principle? </p>
    <p>We appreciate Strib columnist <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5789824.html" target="_blank">Patrick 
      Reusse admitting the racism of Minnesota</a> as seen in the way 
      fans quietly give White Brad Johnson a pass for his errors while screaming 
      for Daunte Culpepper&#8217;s Black neck for his.</p>
    <p>We were the first to expose the City&#8217;s &#8220;round-up&#8221; of 
      Blacks plans (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0509c0504">9</a>,

      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0525c1214">25</a>) 
      in what would be a replay of WWII Japanese detention camps. The 1970s King 
      Arthur Plan (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0509c0504">9</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0525c1214">25</a>) 
      is still alive and well. Most discouraging was the call of the St. Paul 
      Civil Rights Department for the round-up not only of gangs, but their friends 
      and families as well (<strong>Columns</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0510c0518">10</a>, 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q2.htm#0512c0615">12</a>).</p>
    <p>We also raised our concern about the denying of due process (<strong>Column</strong> <a href="2005/columns/05q4.htm#0521c1019">21</a>) 
      and how the University of Minnesota remains Plantation University (Column 
      <a href="2005/columns/05q1.htm#0501c0112">1</a>).</p>
