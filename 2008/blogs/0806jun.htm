<p><strong><a name="0813b0611" id="0808b3"></a>06-11-08, Blog #13: </strong><strong>Congratulations to Alex Jackson, </strong><strong>First Africian American  nominee to be Chief of the Minneapolis Fire Department</strong></p>
<p>Alex Jackson is a 27 year veteran who has served as Interim Chief. Alex was among the 3 rd batch of African American cadets after the feds took control (as a result of the 1971 lawsuit, Carter v. Gallagher (with "Carter" being African American John Carter and "Gallagher" being the City of Minneapolis). </p>
<p>As the Strib <strong></strong>pointed out June 10, 2008 (<a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/19671644.html" target="_blank">Fire chief nominee is longtime integration activist</a>) , this has been a 40 year battle. The consent degree was lifted in 2001. Along the way, the city was fined twice, in 1992 and 1996, for violating the consent degree, the city was fined each time $500,000. During 21 years of this , there was also an Oversight Committee. For ten of thiose years I was the chair. I never missed a meeting in those 21 years. During this period, especially under the leadership of Fire Chief Rocco Forte, the Minneapolis Fire Department became the most diverse in the USA. We know that Alex Jackson will continue this new tradition of racial integration and equal access to promotional opportunities to Blacks as well as to whites. </p>
