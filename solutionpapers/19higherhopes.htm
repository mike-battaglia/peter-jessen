  I.   Introduction</strong></p>
<p>African American Men and Hip Hop Culture Reflect/Act Out NOT Old African Ways 
  but rather Old South White Men Ways, as "Brotherhood" is stomped because of 
  this "acting White:" This False Honor Trumping Valid Conscience makes it a key 
  problem in the Inner City and is one of the reasons for the" status regarding 
  young African American Men in the Inner City "compact zones."   Needed:   a 
  revisiting of what it means to be a man.   The down side of inner city plantation 
  life is the imitation by young African American men of the old White "honor" 
  culture of the duelers of the Old South, creating a modern inner city culture 
  of fear that tears down the culture of community.   Adults have to instill and 
  teach a sense of "true North" in terms of conscience and behavior in order to 
  turn out men dedicated to fulfilling their responsibilities to family, community, 
  and country. </p>

<p>August 7, 2003, of Web Log "Regions of Mind: History, U.S. regionalism, foreign 
  policy, politics, life <a href="http://regionsofmind.blog-city.com/" target="_blank">http://regionsofmind.blog-city.com

<p>Christian evangelicals are so routinely smirked at and belittled these days that 
  it will probably come as surprise to many that evangelicalism was the main force 
  that ended dueling and other attendant violent indulgences of the 19th century 
  South &#8220;honor culture.&#8221; It&#8217;s a fascinating topic involving 
  the gradual replacement of one powerful set of values (fixation on reputation, 
  an easy resort to extralegal violence to safeguard one&#8217;s &#8220;honor&#8217;) 
  with another, equally influential group of values (piety, sobriety, emotional restraint).</p>
<p>The topic came up this week on the H-South listserv. One contributor wrote: 
  Ted Ownby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0807819131" target="_blank">&#8221;Subduing 
  Satan: Religion, Recreation, and Manhood in the Rural South, 1865-1920,&#8221; 
  </a>(UNC Press, 1990) offers yet another perspective from which to explore the 
  relationship between religion and violence in the time period you&#8217;ve identified. 
  Ownby argues that the woman-centered evangelical culture of the rural South 
  self-consciouly positioned itself in opposition to the violence of male culture, 
  especially on the frontier. So, on one level at least, religion is presented 
  as an escape from violence. To be sure, the focus would have been on saving 
  these men from themselves by turning them away from self-destructive behaviors, 
  but mayhem against others, including mob violence, would have been included 
  in women&#8217;s attempts to domesticate their husbands, sons, and brothers 
  (fathers, too?) through religion. </p>
<p>To which Clayton E. Cramer (whose blog is <a href="http://www.claytoncramer.com/" target="_blank">here</a>) 
  added these cogent points as part of the listserv thread: No question about 
  it: evangelical Christianity promoted a culture based on conscience (what will 
  God think of my actions?) as opposed to an honor culture (what will my peers 
  think of me?) and the net effect was to reduce honor culture violence, from 
  which both dueling, and less formal methods of dealing with insult sprung. <br />
  <br />
  [David T.] Courtwright&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/COUVIO.html" target="_blank">&#8221;Violent 
  Land: Single Men and Social Disorder from the Frontier to the Inner City&#8221; 
  </a>makes the argument that cultures dominated by single men are excessively 
  violent, throughout American history, and doesn&#8217;t seem to see the influence 
  of evangelical Christianity in dealing with the honor violence problem. I think 
  Courtwright is correct that all other things being equal, single men dominated 
  cultures tend to be more violent&#8212;but I think the honor vs. conscience 
  culture is the bigger issue. Evangelicalism, it&#8217;s true, did not prevent 
  the ferocious eruption of lynching in the 1890s, but it did contribute to the 
  erosion of a hair-trigger resort to violence to which many white Southerners 
  had been accustomed in white-on-white relations.</p>
<p><strong>By the way: </strong> The Booklist review of &#8220;Violent Land&#8221; 
  includes these comments: </p>



<p>Whether 
  in the cowboy bunkhouse of the last century or the gang crack-house of this 
  one, young men have often wielded guns and knives to deadly effect. Documenting 
  this male violence requires scholarship; explaining it requires cultural insight. 
  Courtwright combines both in a work of compelling timeliness, showing that the 
  same kind of male aggressiveness that once flared into brawls in Dodge City 
  and Abilene is now erupting in the form of drive-by shooting in our inner cities&#8230;No 
  one who cares about America&#8217;s future can ignore Courtwright&#8217;s disturbing 
  thesis.&#8221;  </p>


<p>I wrote at length on the similarities in violent behavior linking antebellum 
  Southern aristocrats and present-day inner-city hustlers in a <a href="http://regionsofmind.blogspot.com/2002_09_15_regionsofmind_archive.html#81771045" target="_blank">post 
  </a>last year at the BlogSpot version of this site: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, the resemblance between the rap culture's emphasis on hyper-sensitivity 
    to imagined slights, and the hair-trigger resort to violence in the face of 
    "disrespect," bears an uncanny resemblance to the values system of the antebellum 
    Southern aristocracy, with its support of dueling and fixation on defending 
    one's "honor." The hubris and violent excess displayed in the brawls of today's 
    rappers are quite similar in spirit to that shown by South Carolinian Preston 
    Brooks in 1856 when he <a href="http://www.senate.gov/learning/min_3c.html" target="_blank">used 
    a cane to bludgeon abolitionist Sen. Charles Sumner </a>in the U.S. Senate 
    chamber. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glenn Reynolds linked to that post, and I got a ton of responses, many of which 
  I quoted in updates at the <a href="http://regionsofmind.blogspot.com/2002_09_15_regionsofmind_archive.html" target="_blank">post.</a></p>

  &#8216;culture of honor&#8217; comes to the Plains</a> (continues from Part 
  II) by Geitner Simmons, Web Log "Regions of Mind" </strong></p>
<p>Tuesday, 23 September 2003 </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve written before about how the &#8220;culture of honor&#8221; that 
  held such sway in the antebellum South sparked many incidents of personal violence 
  and even today reveals itself in violent inner-city subcultures. A new article 
  in the journal <a href="http://www.unl.edu/plains/publications/gpq.html" target="_blank">Great 
  Plains Quarterly </a> examines how that trigger-happy value system sparked mayhem 
  in some cities in the Plains region a century ago. The article, by Clare V. 
  McKanna Jr., is titled &#8220;Black Enclaves of Violence: Race and Homicide 
  in Great Plains Cities, 1890-1920.&#8221; </p>



<p>(Great Plains Quarterly is produced by one of my favorite institutions, <a href="http://www.unl.edu/plains/" target="_blank">the 
  Center for Great Plains Studies </a> at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.) 
</p>



<p>The 
  article looks at crime statistics in Omaha and two Kansas communities (Topeka 
  and Coffeyville), focusing on violence in roughneck bar-and-brothel districts. 
  (Topeka&#8217;s &#8220;enclave of violence&#8221; was known as Smoky Row. Omaha&#8217;s 
  old-time red-light district, as defined in the article, includes the part of 
  downtown near what now includes the World-Herald building and is adjacent to the 
  new convention center/arena.) Many black migrants who frequented such districts 
  brought with them a set of violent habits that had its roots in the South&#8217;s 
  culture of honor, the article argues.  </p>



<p>After 
  describing two inter-racial killings from 1905 in Omaha, the author concludes: 
</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>These two cases diplay aspects of southern culture such as a heightened degree 
    of personal honor. A careless comment, an unintended jostle on the street, 
    or a gesture could bring a quick and deadly response from blacks conditioned 
    by living in the South. Many black southerners had a strong sense of honor 
    that dared not be sullied. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>By the way: </strong> Mike Silverman has a related post at <a href="http://www.mikesilverman.com/" target="_blank">Red 
  Letter Day. </a> He <a href="http://www.mikesilverman.com/2003_09_21_log_archive.html#106432979153721851" target="_blank">praises 
  a book </a> he&#8217;s read about the history of dueling. The book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/1582343667/reviews/103-1029177-4141412#15823436675000" target="_blank">&#8220;Gentlemen&#8217;s 
  Blood : A Thousand Years of Sword and Pistol&#8221; </a> by Barbara Holland. 
  From an interesting blurb about the book: </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Besides accounts of such famed duel winners as Jim Bowie&#8212;or losers, 
    like Alexander Hamilton&#8212;she describes astronomer Tycho Brahe getting 
    his nose sliced off, artist Caravaggio slaying a victorious tennis opponent 
    and writer Alexander Pushkin canceling a gunfight in progress because of a 
    snowstorm&#8230; </p>
  <p>The medieval justice of trial by combat evolved into the private duel by 
    sword and pistol, with thousands of honorable men&#8212;and not-so-honorable 
    women&#8212;giving lives and limbs to wipe out an insult or prove a point. 
    Here are their stories, from Dumas&#8217;s Three Musketeers to America&#8217;s 
    founding fathers, including the New Orleans doctors who settled their medical 
    disagreements under The Oaks, the short-lived newspaper editors of America&#8217;s 
    South and West, and certain 21st-century Parisian politicians. </p>

<p><strong>Part IV:  </strong><strong>Quotes of Conscience:   </strong> </p>


<p>&#8220;The only guide to a man is his <strong>conscience </strong> ; the only 
  shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very 
  imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often 
  mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting of our calculations; but 
  with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of 
  honor.&#8221;&#8212;Sir Winston S. Churchill </p>



<p>&#8220;Since your majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will 
  answer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am convicted by scripture and 
  plain reason&#8212;I do not accept the authority of popes and councils for the

  to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against 
  conscience is neither right not safe. Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise, God 
  help me. Amen.&#8221;  &#8212;Martin Luther, April 18, 1521   </p>

<p><strong>Part V:  </strong><strong>Minneapolis Story Blog #139, Sept. 17, 2003 
  </strong> </p>


<p><strong>#139. 
  The anti-gun toting DFL and the gun toting inner city Black youth, are a lot 
  a like: they both rely on guns (the DFL relies on the police to carry theirs 
  for them). Both prefer the old south's "culture of false honor" over the "enlightenment's 
  culture of conscience."  </strong> </p>



<p>The 
  DFL is opposed to carry and conceal. Certainly rural Minnesota is not about 
  to give up its guns. But the DFL believes in carry openly, one step removed: 
  they pay the local and state police to carry their guns for them. The inner 
  city Black youth carry their guns openly and concealed. Both believe in guns. 
  Neither is resolving the problem. Both feel they are not being respected. Both 
  openly duel with each other, resulting in the occasional death, although usually 
  Black rather than White death. Both need to grow up. "Conscience" tells us the 
  difference between right and wrong and we act on that if our intent is to do 
  good. "False Honor" is a twisted concept of saving face by fighting whoever 
  one perceives to have slighted him. "Dissing" or disrespect is considered reason 
  enough to fight or kill the other. This was the code of the pre-Civil War South 
  among single White males: White on White violence. Now inner city Blacks have 
  stepped backwards, not forwards, and adopted the same. And what does the local 
  NAACP say? We are like that and that it will take generations to fix. I reject 
  that. Whites would reject that and not let it happen to their young. But our 
  cowed Black leadership refuses to call out the city, on conscience, refuses 
  to call out the DFL, on conscience, and instead plots and schemes against the 
  Blacks, the Greens, and the Reds (those parts of the political map labeled Republican). 
  Its time we as a community of Blacks called on our heritage of family and conscience 
  to beat off the culture of guns and false honor confrontations. How to begin 
  is outlined in Chapter 17 of my book.  </p>



<p>But Blacks are cautious regarding gun control. We were not allowed any during 
  slave days. We were kept helpless. Guns on the street are different from guns 
  in the home. When I remember The 1921 Tulsa Race Riots against Blacks, and how 
  armed Blacks gathered across the South to come to the rescue, I take pause before 
  blanketly saying: no guns (see Interlude 13 of my book, "The Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes"). The same is true when I think of Rosewood, Florida (Interlude 
  13). Indeed, there are those who say Blacks would have been even worse treated 
  if it wasn't for the fear of Whites that they would get shot by Blacks in self 
  defense. That still leaves us with the problem of "Impacted Neighborhoods" with 
  high numbers of people of color and high crime rates which suggests that they 
  do not receive "equal protection under the law" as the more affluent mainly 
  white communities do, and thus are less eager to not be allowed fire arms, especially 
  when the young following the old White South's "false honor" are left on the 
  street with their guns.</p>
<p><strong>Part VI:  </strong><strong>The problem with young inner city African-American 
  men who are in <a href="13emergency.htm">"emergency"</a> status as they reflect 
  Old South White Men:   False Honor Trumping African Conscience. </strong> </p>



<p>People 
  have asked for more detail about Blog entry <strong>#139. The anti-gun toting 
  DFL and the gun toting inner city Black youth, are a lot a like: they both rely 
  on guns (the DFL relies on the police to carry theirs for them). Both prefer 
  the old south's "culture of false honor" over the "enlightenment's culture of 
  conscience." </strong> </p>



<p>The 
  <strong>NAACP </strong> (local and national) provides "good" examples [see numerous 
  Blog entries on both] of serving individual honor for its executives rather 
  than from a sense of community conscience for its members.  </p>


<p>As seen above from the Blogging of Omaha Blogger, Geitner Simmons, and his 
  web log <a href="http://regionsofmind.blog-city.com/" target="_blank">"Regions 
  Of Mind,"</a> he writes on history learned from the H-South list serv and it 
  comments on two books. The title of the first book, <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/COUVIO.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Violent 
  Land: Single Men and Social Disorder from the Frontier to the Inner City&#8221; 
  </a> by David David T. Courtwright, 1990, says a lot about the problem. The 
  second book, <a href="http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0807819131" target="_blank">&#8221;Subduing 
  Satan: Religion, Recreation, and Manhood in the Rural South, 1865-1920&#8221; 
  </a> , by Ted Ownby </p>



<p>Five things are clear:   <strong>(1) </strong> inner city violence didn't start 
  with Black youth.   As Courtwright points out in his book, "violent and disorderly 
  behavior" has long been the situation where young, single men gather with no 
  sense of ethics or morals.   As he notes, "What began in the mining camp and 
  bunkhouse has simply continued in the urban world of today, where many young, 
  armed, intoxicated, honor-conscious bachelors have reverted to frontier conditions." 
    In other words, Black is not the issue; young, single men without moorings 
  are (see the recent film "Gangs of New York").   <strong>(2) </strong> inner 
  city violence is a young person's sport.   This relates back to our schools 
  and the need to prepare all young people for the future, not just the college 
  bound. <strong>(3) </strong> religion or a sense of ethics and morals, a conscience, 
  or a sense of God or s supreme being, if you will, is still important.   In 
  Chapter 5 of   my book I offer the Golden Rule.   See   my <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8220;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221; </a> piece.   <strong>(4) </strong> the irony of racism:   
  it is now in vogue in too many places among Black youth to say that education 
  is "White" and therefore Blacks should steer clear of it.   <strong>(5) </strong> 
  The <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8220;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221; </a> piece outlines 7 areas that need to be addressed for the 
  positive future of Minneapolis:   <strong>(1) </strong> Education, <strong>(2) 
  </strong> Jobs, <strong>(3) </strong> Housing, <strong>(4) </strong> Public 
  Safety, <strong>(5) </strong> Safe Environment, <strong>(6) </strong> Governing, 
  and <strong>(7) </strong> Ethics. </p>



<p>In 
  the case of this discussion, our modern, inner city youths have gotten into 
  something that, in the United State, is indeed <strong>very </strong> "White:" 
  violence and fighting, of dueling over perceived slights or insults to preserve 
  one's "inner directed" sense of honor based on what peers think as opposed to 
  approaching relations with others as "other directed," meaning ethical or moral 
  as a base of "conscience" as a guide to relating to others in community as opposed 
  to the opposite of that, "self oriented," relating on the basis of what makes 
  one feel good or bad regardless of whether the feeling is correct or not and 
  regardless of the feelings and sensitivities, and honor, if you will, not to 
  mention consequences for, of others as a result of the action taken.   We see 
  this leaving the inner cities as it influences hip how and "rap," and is now 
  picked up by young White men who also get too much into "hip hop" rather than 
  "high hopes."  </p>


<p><strong>Part VII:   Learning how to become men. </strong><strong>New books 
  teaching manhood to young men. </strong><strong>The Power of Positve Expectations 
  Over Negative Ones    </strong> </p>


<p>In the <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8220;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221; </a> paper, this is stated about young men: </p>
<p>1. In terms of <strong>education</strong>: (See Chapter 7) </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>a. Abandon the notion that neither the city nor state has &#8220;no meaningful 
    obligation to provide any high school education at all&#8221; (p. 121). </p>
  <p>b. Change the attitude from accepting poor schools (&#8221;beat the odds&#8221;) 
    to expecting good schools and expecting all kids to be winners (p. 122). </p>
  <p>c. Divest the investment in ideologies of college prep, muted or no gender 
    identity, and invest in the practicality of positively channeling male puberty 
    not ignoring or subverting it. </p>
  <p>d. Recognize that the skewing of the education system as a socialization 
    system for high achieving boys that fails those with no desire for o inclination 
    to college, who are thus not served by a college prepatory system. </p>
  <p>e. Recognize that socialization takes many forms, not the few offered in 
    the schools, especially during the period of puberty. &#8220;The crux of the 
    matter, as with all societies, is how best to harness the energies of young 
    men&#8221; (p. 152). </p>
  <p>f. Re-evaluate the prejudices of &#8220;modernity&#8221; and again provide 
    boys with vocational schools or technical tracks. </p>
  <p>g. Abandon &#8220;the modern&#8221; prejudice against physical and technical 
    education so needed, especially for adolescent males. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. 
  In terms of <strong>jobs </strong> : (see Chapter 9)  </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>f. How this relates specifically to young Black males is on pp. 154-156. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. 
    In terms of <strong>housing </strong> (Chapter 8)  </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>h. Stop the &#8220;concentration and containment&#8221; of Blacks in crime 
    impact and poverty neighborhoods, and open all housing to all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. 
    In terms of <strong>Public Safety </strong> (Chapter 16):  </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>b. Acknowledge the problem with Black youth and crime has reached emergency 
    proportions and needs to be dealt with immediately (see my my Solution Paper 
    on the <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8221;emergency&#8221; 
    </a> with Black youth. </p>
  <p>c. Stop making the war on drugs a war on young Black men (&#8221;When society 
    purposefully not only prevents, but also withholds opportunities for decent 
    education, jobs and incomes through policies that allow discrimination and 
    exclusion, it is the same as making war on them&#8221; (p. 148). Call it racism, 
    call it prejudice, call it discrimination, call it what you will (as a rose 
    by any other name is still a rose), end the disparity in arrests and imprisonment 
    among citizens: </p>
  <p>i. Note: &#8220;76% of all users of illegal drugs are White, yet 70% of drug 
    convictions are Black&#8230;White youths are one third more likely to have 
    sol drugs than Black youth, yet it is Black youth who get arrested&#8221; 
    (pp. 150-151). </p>
  <p>ii. &#8220;Blacks constitute 13 percent of all drug users, but 35 percent 
    of those arrested for drug possession, 55 percent of persons convicted, and 
    74 percent of people sent to prison&#8221; (Human Rights Watch Report: Punishment

<p>7. 
  In terms of a <strong>moral framework: </strong>  </p>



<blockquote>
  <p>c. Self-reliance requires an asset base, which includes education, housing, 
    and jobs (p. 147). Stop taking Black wealth (Interlude 8) and enable it. </p>
  <p>i. Utilize the best that can be found in conflict resolution models (see 
    ), as well as the four questions on p. 321 in the Conclusion chapter. </p>
  <p>f. Call &#8220;a family meeting&#8221;: as has been pointed out elsewhere, 
    back in the year 2000, Dave Jennings, now with the school district, in discussing 
    the stadium problem, said &#8220;someone other than the teams have to create 
    a public discussion about the future of the Twins and the Vikings in Minnesota. 
    The teams are crying out for somebody to call the family meeting&#8221; (Star 
    Tribune,8-10-00). So too, <strong>the problems outlined in my book call out 
    for a public discussion, for a &#8220;family meeting.&#8221; </strong> Who 
    should call it? Why not the Urban League, the NAACP, or the two together? 
    How about a newspaper? A company? A coalition? Let the family meeting be called. 
    Let the conversation begin. Use this Solution Paper to develop the agenda.

<p>These excerpts from the <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8220;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221;</a> paper point to the <strong>social context needed: </strong> 
    <strong>Learning how to become men.   </strong> Studies regarding high expectations, 
  as opposed to low expectations, show the latter is what is called "The Minneapolis 
  Story" as "clubbing the cubs" whereas the former enables them to grow up and 
  succeed as responsible adults.   This has also led to the "coming back" of time 
  honored understandings regarding the socialization process of teaching manhood 
  to young men.   Needed:   applying the power of positive expectations to defeat 
  negative Ones. </p>



<p>We 
  currently operate under the low expectations of the 1968 Kerner Commission Report 
  inspired policies and the 1998 The Bell Curve, both of which state Blacks can't 
  make it on their own (low expectations) for different reasons.   The liberal 
  Kerner piece merely says Blacks didn't come over like normal immigrants and 
  therefore don't have that avenue open to them.   The conservative Bell Curve 
  says we can't make as we are too dumb.   Both teach/demonstrate low expectations. 
    Research shows that people respond to expectations of them.   Kids respond 
  to teachers according to the expectations of them.   Teams to coaches as well. 
</p>


<p>This is huge in terms of education (Chapter 7 in my book) and should be very 
  helpful in the inner city working with kids as it bolsters our argument in the 
  book and those as expanded in my <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8220;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221; </a> paper. </p>


<p>So 
  if the NAACP and others of their ilk say it is hopeless and that it will take 
  generations to fix the problems of education and jobs and housing, etc., and 
  that expectation is conveyed from the pulpits and in the homes and classrooms 
  and neighborhood, is it any wonder why it is so easy to club the cubs? </p>


<p><strong>The book:   Season of Life:   A football star, a ballboy, a journey 
  to manhood, by Jeffrey Marx, tells the story of former outstanding NFL staward, 
  Joe Ehrmann.   His goal is to teach manhood as fulfilling responsibilitlies 
  to family, community and country. From <a href="http://www.hbo.com/realsports/stories.shtml" target="_blank">"Real 
  Sports"</a> by Joe Ehrmann:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a menacing defensive lineman for the Baltimore Colts in the 1970s, Joe 
    Ehrmann experienced first-hand the hyper-masculine world of professional football. 
    Yet his success as a professional, and the rousing lifestyle and fame that 
    it afforded, left him unfulfilled. Inspired by the loss of his younger brother 
    to cancer, he began studying for the ministry, and was ordained a full-time 
    minister after retiring from the NFL. Today, he has made it his <strong>life&#8217;s 
    mission to preach a new definition of masculinity to impressionable young 
    men. As an assistant coach at Baltimore&#8217;s Gilman School, he teaches 
    young football players that the success of a man is measured not by blocks, 
    tackles or touchdowns, but by his ability to fulfill his responsibilities 
    to his family, community and country. </strong> REAL SPORTS catches up with 
    Joe Ehrmann, whose simple philosophy of love has taken hold in the unlikeliest 
    of places: the football field. </p>

<p>Joe 
  sees his coaching as part of his ministry to teach boys how to be men, that 
  sports is merely illustrative of life, not life itself, and that life is not 
  about x's and o's or winning or losing, but rather about what kind of father 
  they will become, what kind of husbands they will become.   They are to learn 
  how to achieve responsible change to do good in the world.   Joe serves as an 
  Assistant Coach at Gilman high school in Baltimore.   Both the Ravens and the 
  Cowboys have ordered this book for their teams.    </p>



<p>In 
  the old days, boys learned by watching their fathers and the men in their village 
  or town.   But with fathers now leaving home to go to work or leaving the home 
  altogether, boys have no one to watch.   Thus a huge influence on kids is their 
  male coaches.   They teach that men are built to help others.    </p>


<p>This is what David Pence writes about in his book <u>Apostles, Knights &amp; 
  Founding Fathers </u> .   For Pence we have sustained <strong>an inversion of 
  values </strong> such that we have set aside the reality of sex roles and the 
  natural order of the role of men in protecting their communities out of civic 
  loyalty vis a vis their masculine fraternity, the latter being dismembered and 
  feminized.   David writes of the need to re-invert such that as we turn boys 
  to men they become protectors and not predators, and understand the need to 
  follow both the time honored traditions by which we have lived but also learn 
  a time honored trade to be productive, whether learned in college or vocational 
  school.   This also fits the "state of emergency" of young Black men, as taken 
  from the book by Kunjufu, a Black Christian Ph.D. and preacher in his book "State 
  of Emergency:   We <u>Must </u> Save African American Males," of which the key 
  lines are printed on pp. 155-156 of The Minneapolis Story. </p>
<p>This 
  is important not only for young Black men but young White men as well.   How 
  often do we hear people expressing disbelief at actions of young White men with 
  the phrase "They'r from such good homes."  </p>



<p>The 
  good news about his violence is that very little is interracial.   Its Black 
  guys being violent on other Blacks and White guys being violent on other Whites. 
    The cop-out phrase "boys will be boys" must be replaced with "men will be 
  men," meaning men responsible to family, community and country, with their focus 
  on protecting family, community and country, not tearing any of them down.   
</p>



<p>William James, considered to be the father of American psychology, answered, 
  when asked what was the secret to success in life, said three things:   kindness, 
  kindness, and kindness.   Along with the sociologist Lester Ward and philosopher 
  John Dewey, they didn't accept the notion of social darwinism predeterminism. 
    Believing all basically the same but from different starting points, it was 
  their contention that the so-called "uncivilized masses" could learn and that 
  the seemingly most mediocre would double or triple their achievements if properly 
  taught.   At the heart of it all was education.   But for this to occur they 
  said people had to be free.   Thus Teddy Roosevelt couldn't see how any totalitarian 
  state could long survive because crushing despotism also crushes the human spirit 
  to achieve.   Our fundamental difference with many countries and culture is 
  that we genuinely believe in every man's and everyone woman's worth.   Missing 
  is seeing full worth in those not White.   The 7th of my <a href=https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/actualize.html>&#8221;Seven 
  Solutions&#8221; </a> is ethics, because society is not a factory, people are 
  not potted plants to be bio-engineered, and individuals have free will and thus 
  need guidance in their choices between what will be good or ill for self/family 
  and/or community/society.   The moral dimenion of values and faith is what enables 
  us to persevere and achieve.   We have allowed our abdication in society of 
  properly raising young men to lead not to neighborliness and generosity, or 
  individualism achieving great things, but to nervousness, gloomyness, apathy 
  and violence, as we create a group of THEM who in turn take over the role of 
  socializing the next generation of young men in their neighborhoods and beyond 
  coming after them, etc. If thinking of dealing with the current generation produces 
  yawns or more moves to isolate them in separate &#8220;containment zones&#8221; 
  of the inner city, then think of their arithmetic growth as they socialize those 
  coming after them. That should get our attention, if for no other reason than 
  selfish self preservation. That should inspire us to act now so as not to have 
  to pay for lack of action later in the form of social unrest. </p>
<p>The 
  expectation literature, the positive thinking literature, the possibilities 
  of meaning literature, the motivational and success literature in general paints 
  a picture of the potential for achievement and progress and success for everyone 
  if they&#8217;ll follow any one of a number of recipes. But society holds the 
  mixing bowl. Society determines the ingredients, especially the main ingredient, 
  education, and society greatly influences whether we will also foster a free, 
  fair, and wealth allowing society so that all have an equal opportunity to learn 
  and equal access to the process of trial and error in finding one&#8217;s way 
  in employment.   <strong>So what is the recipe for young men?</strong>   One 
  would have to look long and hard to find a better starting point than Rudyard 
  Kiplings poem "If," which runs through a series of "ifs," and then concludes, 
  <strong>if the ifs are met, "Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, 
  / and-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son!"</strong></p>
