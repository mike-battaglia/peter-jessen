<p><strong>Enduring Through Music: Here, There, and Everywhere</strong></p>
<p>When we think of the unfair and unjust, we immediately think of both &#8220;anywhere 
  but here&#8221; and &#8220;not here, not there, not anywhere.&#8221; When we think 
  of that which is fair and just, we think &#8220;here, there, and everywhere.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>This appendix carries more detailed examples of how Blacks have endured White 
  oppression, nationwide, especially through our music, which for us is &#8220;here, 
  there, and everywhere.&#8221; Lyrics listed below are for these songs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep on Pushing&#8221; &#8220;We&#146;re a Winner&#8221; &#8220;Move on Up&#8221; &#8220;Say it Loud, I&#146;m Black and I&#146;m Proud&#8221; &#8220;Ain&#146;t 
  No Stoppin&#146; Us Now&#8221; &#8220;Save the Children&#8221; &#8220;What&#146;s 
  Going On&#8221; &#8220;Redemption Song&#8221;</p>
<p>Think of Black music and soul and rhythm and blues as ways to overcome and 
  transcend the treatment Whites wouldn&#146;t want done to them. Despite it all, 
  we have maintained a wonderful attitude. </p>
<p>Stella may have lost her groove and had to get it back. But Blacks have always 
  had their groove, whether the riffs of Jazz, the soul-satisfying Negro Spirituals 
  during slave days and beyond, the uplifting of &#8220;Amazing Grace,&#8221; the 
  syncopation of the Black-invented banjo, our dealing with inequities through 
  the singing of the blues while keeping our spirits up with ragtime and honky 
  tonk, whether we danced to the jazz piano of Jelly Roll Morton or the soul piano 
  of Ray Charles, or the soaring jazz trumpet of Louis &#8220;Satchmo&#8221; Armstrong, 
  the guitar of Clarence &#8220;Gatemouth&#8221; Brown, the marimba of Lionel Hampton, 
  or we mentally swung to the jazz of Preservation Hall in New Orleans, or Duke 
  Ellington in Harlem&#146;s Cotton Club, with the Congeroo, Lindy Hop, and the 
  Conga at Harlem&#146;s Savoy Ballroom, or the wondrous sounds of Leadbelly, 
  Josh White, Muddy Waters, David &#8220;Honeyboy&#8221; Edwards, B.B. King, Charlie 
  Parker, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Miles Davis, Sam Cooke, the 
  Motown sounds, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Curtis Mayfield, not to mention the 
  great ladies of song: Ruth Brown, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Lena Horn, Dorothy 
  Dandridge, Arethra Franklin, Diana Ross, and so many more. </p>
<p>Blacks on chain gangs and work crews passed the time singing work songs and 
  spirituals. They could chain us but they could not break us. They could claim 
  our bodies but they could not claim our spirits. For centuries in America, we 
  have sung the songs that have been our saving grace through generations of abuse, 
  the kind of Pentecostal jazz disco that shaped Elvis Presley (rock &amp; roll 
  is a form of Black blues music). Our music was necessary for our indigent community&#8217;s 
  survival, keeping us in touch with the higher Spirits of life through good times 
  and bad. Indeed, music is even more important to some Black teenagers than sports. 
  Music was always the vehicle through which a slave could travel through time 
  substituting fantasy for reality. Some tunes were sad, some happy, and some 
  triumphant. There were church songs, work songs, love songs, and folk songs. 
  And this is true of any oppressed people. But even our music has slipped. We 
  need more Black artists standing up as James Brown did with his &#8220;Don&#146;t 
  Be a Drop-Out,&#8221; and &#8220;Say it Loud, I&#146;m Black and I&#146;m Proud,&#8221; 
  and &#8220;Open Up The Door,&#8221; or Curtis Mayfield&#146;s &#8220;Keep on Pushing,&#8221; 
  We&#146;re a Winner,&#8221; &#8220;People get Ready,&#8221; and &#8220;We&#146;re 
  Moving on Up,&#8221; or the McFadden and Whitehead song, &#8220;Ain&#146;t No 
  Stoppin&#146; Us Now.&#8221; </p>
<p>Too many Black artists today glorify sex and drugs and depravity and negativity. 
  They hurt our young Black men when, with their music, as the musicians of old, 
  they could help them, lift them up, so they don&#146;t wind up as drop-outs, 
  that that respond that they are Black and proud, not down and out, and keep 
  on pushing to move up. We considered these our anthems. Below are the words 
  to several of the songs that meant much to my generation. When young Black men 
  start getting excited about this kind of music again, when young Black music 
  moguls return to the reality of life as Black men in America, rather than the 
  pursuit of riches and appearances on TV shows where they can brag about their &#8220;cribs&#8221; and &#8220;living large,&#8221; then we will be back on the 
  right track. For them, who may read this, I offer these songs as a hope that 
  it will inspire them to seek a way to inspire young Black men to aspire, not 
  expire on drugs and violence. These were our anthems. I urge today&#146;s young 
  Black musicians to develop anthems for their generation as well, anthems of 
  hope and overcoming, of not taking their eyes off the prize, freedom politically 
  and economically for all. Curtis Mayfield, particularly, is misunderstood by 
  gangsta rap that tries to immitate him, as for Curtis, he advocated that young 
  men make themselves into the ultimate soul man, which for hiim meant anti-drug 
  and anti- violence.</p>
<p><strong>Here are key excerpts from their songs. We need more of them for our Black 
  inner city youth today:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Curtis Mayfield &#8220;Keep on Pushing&#8221; </strong> <a href="http://www.guitaretab.com/i/impressions/8666.htm" target="_blank">http://www.guitaretab.com/i/impressions/8666.htm</a> 
  Keep on pushing Keep on pushing I got to keep on pushing, I can&#8217;t stop now Move 
  up a little higher Some way or some how Cause I&#8217;ve got my strength Don&#8217;t make 
  sense, not to Keep on pushing Hallelu-jah Hallelu-jah Keep on pushing</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We&#146;re a Winner&#8221; </strong> <a href="http://www.murchisoncenter.org/malcolm/lyrics.htm#We%27re%20a%20Winner" target="_blank">http://www.murchisoncenter.org/malcolm/lyrics.htm#We&#8217;re%20a%20Winner</a> 
  We&#8217;re a winner and never let anybody say, &#8220;boy you can&#8217;t make it&#8221; 
  Cause a feeble mind is in your way No more tears do we cry And we have finally 
  dried our eyes And we&#8217;re moving on up Lord have mercy, we&#8217;re moving on up</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Move on Up&#8221; </strong> <a href="http://home.concepts.nl/%7Eavroomen/moveonup.htm" target="_blank">http://home.concepts.nl/~avroomen/moveonup.htm</a>

  Hush now child and don&#8217;t you cry Your folks might understand you by and by Move 
  on up towards your destination You may find from time to time Complications 
  Bight your lip and take a trip Though there may be wet road ahead You cannot 
  slip So move on up and peace you will find Into the steeple of beautiful people 
  Where there&#8217;s only one kind So hush now child and don&#8217;t you cry Your folks might 
  understand you by and by Just move on up and keep on wishing Remember your dreams 
  are your only schemes So keep on pushing Take nothing less - not even second 
  best And do not obey - you must have your say You can past the test Move on 
  up!</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Don&#146;t Be A Drop Out&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Say it Loud, I&#146;m Black and I&#146;m Proud&#8221; </strong>

  Work your bad self Say it loud &#8220;I&#8217;m black and I&#8217;m proud&#8221; Say it loud &#8220;I&#8217;m black and I&#8217;m proud&#8221; Look here, some people say we got a lot 
  of malice some say it&#8217;s a lot of nerve but I say we won&#8217;t quit moving until 
  we get what we deserve. We&#8217;ve been buked and we&#8217;ve been scarred we&#8217;ve been treated 
  bad, talked about as sure as you born. But just as sure as it takes two eyes 
  to make a pair, brother we can&#8217;t quit until we get our share. Say it loud &#8220;I&#8217;m 
  black and I&#8217;m proud&#8221; Say it loud &#8220;I&#8217;m black and I&#8217;m proud&#8221; One

  </a>Ain&#8217;t no stopping us now, we&#8217;re on the move Ain&#8217;t no stopping us now, we 
  got the groove There&#8217;s been so many things That held us down But now it looks 
  like things Are finally coming around I know we&#8217;ve got A long long way to go 
  And where we&#8217;ll end up I don&#8217;t know (Chorus) But we won&#8217;t let nothin&#8217; hold us 
  back Put our show together We&#8217;re polishing up our act well And if you&#8217;ve ever 
  been Held down before I know you refuse to be Held down any more Don&#8217;t you let 
  nothin&#8217; stand in your way I want y&#8217;all to listen Listen to every word I say 
  Every word I say I know you know someone Who has a negative vibe And if you&#8217;re

  I just want to ask a question Who really cares? To save a world in despair There&#8217;ll 
  come a time, when the world won&#8217;t be singin&#8217; Flowers won&#8217;t grow, bells won&#8217;t 
  be ringin&#8217; Who really cares? Who&#8217;s willing to try to save a world That&#8217;s destined 
  to die When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow Little children today 
  are really gonna suffer tomorrow Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live All 
  who is to blame, we can&#8217;t stop livin&#8217; Live, live for life But let live everybody 
  Live life for the children Oh, for the children You see, let&#8217;s save the children 
  Let&#8217;s save all the children Save the babies, save the babies If you wanna love, 
  you got to save the babies All of the children But who really cares Who&#8217;s willing 
  to try Yes, to save a world Yea, save our sweet world Save a world that is destined 
  to die Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Oh, oh dig it everybody</p>

  </a> Mother, mother There&#8217;s too many of you crying Brother, brother, brother 
  There&#8217;s far too many of you dying You know we&#8217;ve got to find a way To bring 
  some lovin&#8217; here today - Ya Father, father We don&#8217;t need to escalate You see, 
  war is not the answer For only love can conquer hate You know we&#8217;ve got to find 
  a way To bring some lovin&#8217; here today Picket lines and picket signs Don&#8217;t punish 
  me with brutality Talk to me, so you can see Oh, what&#8217;s going on What&#8217;s going 
  on Ya, what&#8217;s going on Ah, what&#8217;s going on In the mean time Right on, baby Right 
  on Right on Oh, you know we&#8217;ve got to find a way To bring some understanding 
  here today. Oh</p>
<p><strong>Bob Marley &#8220;Redemption Song&#8221; </strong> Old pirates, yes, 
  they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships. Minutes after they took I, from the 
  bottomless pit. But my hand was made strong by the hand of the Almighty. We 
  forward in this generation, triumphantly. Won&#8217;t you help to sing, these songs 
  of freedom? Cause all I ever have, redemption songs, redemption songs. Emancipate 
  yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds. Have 
  no fear for atomic energy, cause none of them can stop the time. How long shall 
  they kill our prophets, while we stand aside and look? Oh, some say it&#8217;s just 
  a part of it, we&#8217;ve got to fulfil the book. Won&#8217;t you help to sing these songs 
  of freedom? Cause all I ever have, redemption songs, redemption songs, redemption 
  songs.</p>
