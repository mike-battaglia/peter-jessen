<p><strong>Blog #250. December 11, 2003: Call to the Minneapolis Community (citizens, 
  neighborhood organizations, churches, voluntary organizations, corporations, 
  small businesss, etc): Become apart of the solution, not the problem: Be People 
  of Resolution and Solution to Achieve the Prize of Freedom: equal access and 
  equal opportunity for all. </strong></p>
<p>There are several wonderful pieces to use to help discuss the 7 critical areas 
  of need in Minneapolis (education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, ethcis). Several come to mind that could be used to hold discussions, 
  workshops, and seminars, especially (1) the book, <i>The Minnenapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes,</i> (2) the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a> paper , (3) the <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> paper (“The Blocks to Construct 
  a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together”), and (4) the materials on the 
  web site of www.theminneapolisstory.com. Will we let yesterday’s questions haunt 
  tomorrows answers? Will we strive to meet High Hopes or continue the status 
  quo of Hopeless Helplessness? Dream Fulfillment or Dream Deferment.” For this 
  holiday season, my publisher is offering the book at a special price of $15 
  each, or $10 each for orders for 10 or more, or $7.50 each for orders over 10 
  for discussion groups of community and voluntary organizations (plus S&H). The 
  books can be ordered from either www.TheMinneapolis.com or www.BeaconOnTheHill.com.

<p><strong><a name="03249b1211"></a>Blog #249. December 11, 2003: Call to the Mayor and City Council: Be 
  People of Resolution and Solution to Achieve the Prize of Freedom: equal access 
  and equal opportunity for all. </strong>
<p>I have just received this letter copy from my publisher. It was sent to the 
  Mayor and the City council. It is an open letter to the Mayor and City Council 
  to Review the book and critique the solutions as a way to begin a Minneapolis 
  “family discussion” to first resolve to solve and then act to solve the city’s 
  problems in the seven areas of education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe 
  environment, governing, and ethics, and then either keep the book for future 
  reference or donate the book to a library (public, school, government, agency, 
  college or university, etc.), as the last time they were sent a copy they returned 
  them saying they couldn’t receive “gifts.” Can you imagine? I share my publisher’s 
  letter with you here: 
<blockquote> 
  <p>December 8, 2003<br>
    Dear Minneapolis Mayor and City Council Members, </p>
  <p>The enclosed book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i> is NOT 
    a gift! This is a review copy, also called “surplus” copy. If you still feel 
    you have to return it as you did last time, give it instead to a library. 
    Then, as now, it is sent as input from a citizen, a community person, Ron 
    Edwards, to add to the public dialogue of issues facing the city. Ron is a 
    citizen you all have, do, and will interact with in some way. My <a href="../../solutionpapers/02letternaacp.htm">original 
    letter</a> concluded with: “If you have any further questions or 
    wish to use the book for discussion groups, as some have suggested, or other 
    uses, just let us at Beacon on the Hill Press know how we can help.” I noted 
    then that (emphasis added): </p>
  <p>The book uses the term &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racist.&#8221; These terms are not used to 
    emotionally obscure fuzzy thinking about the causes of poverty, inequality, 
    different levels of school achievement, etc., about which there is much debate 
    (but, as Ron says Nellie Stone Johnson always used to remind him, &#8220;No education, 
    no jobs, no housing, no hope&#8221;). Ron uses the terms to build on the Star Tribune&#8217;s 
    1991 series on racism in Minnesota (&#8221;Issues of Race&#8221;) as he notes in Interlude 
    2. The terms refer to the prejudice, discrimination, segregation, bigotry, 
    and bias used to deny equal access and equal opportunity, something [many] 
    Whites did not see [in 1991] as an issue. </p>
  <p>In a word, the book is about the gaps that still exist between Blacks and 
    Whites in education, jobs, housing, and public safety, why they happened and 
    how to close them. One school of public policy thought blames it innately 
    on Blacks, hence the legality of slavery and Jim Crow. Current public policy 
    follows the 1968 Kerner Commission Report that stated Blacks can’t make it 
    on their own and thus need the support and direction of the government (continued 
    by the 1998 “The Bell Curve” that concludes the same saying Blacks are too 
    dumb to make it on their own). These public policy assumptions have kept Blacks 
    from the table of equal access and equal opportunity. In his book Ron calls 
    for changes in public policy in the gap areas to begin to undo the damage 
    caused by those assumptions. As you are the closest to public policy making 
    you are the ones best able to reverse bad policy instituted by your predecessors. 
    However, each time a policy group doesn’t do so, they too become part of the 
    reasons for the gaps. That is not a “blame” statement. It is a legacy statement. 
    Certainly all of us realize that we live in a world that is not free of intellectual 
    difficulties, not free of insoluable problems, such that if we would just 
    all have good will these problems would be solved. Breaking the cycle of welfare 
    dependency for both Blacks and Whites (not to mention corporations) and enabling 
    long-term employment is still a shared goal without a clear ”how to” answer 
    in our post-agricultural, post-industrial, information dominated economy. 
    But Ron lists specific “how’s” for closing the gaps. </p>
  <p>Ron doesn’t suggest in his book that “ought” equals “can.” He does suggest 
    that the gaps can be closed and outlines a process for achieving it. To do 
    so, the first requirement is to repudiate the 1968 policy base of the Kerner 
    Commission Report that Blacks are “unable” to make it on their own and thus 
    need government support and direction. The second requirement is the political 
    will to act with appropriate public policy reflecting a repudiation of Kerner 
    policy. This is not to deny government programs. But it is hard to argue with 
    the empirical reality that “American capitalism is the most efficient antipoverty 
    machine the world has ever seen.” Government can help but not when its programs 
    are never doubted or, worse, excused when they do actual, proven damage, as 
    seen in the gaps Ron articulates in his book that government policy helped 
    create. Those are addressable. Ron recognizes the insight of JFK that the 
    economic system is not some monolith acting on people. Rather, people act 
    upon it, hence JFK’s “don’t ask what government can do for you” question, 
    but rather, instead, ask what people can do for themselves and for the government. 
    In other words, Ron’s book avoids the anthropomorphic attitude of an economic 
    “system” that always places the key role on government. </p>
  <p>We would like to receive your thoughts on Ron’s suggestions for closing the 
    gaps by insuring there is a place at the table for everyone, as outlined in 
    (1) the suggestions of the book gathered together in Chapter 17, that have 
    been expanded and arranged into (2) the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
    Solutions</a> paper and (3) the <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
    Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a>, paper (both being in the Solution Papers section of www.TheMinneapolisStory.com web site). We believe Minneapolis 
    can use these to either show the way to other cities on how to solve the problems 
    of the inner city or it can continue the opposite, showing America how to 
    keep inner city Blacks down and “in their place”. </p>
  <p>In the 8/31/03 7 Solutions piece, David Jennings is quoted, at 7.f, following 
    a statement of his in the Strib in 2000, of the need to hold public discussions, 
    what he called a “family meeting,” on critical issues facing the city. In 
    this case, 7 issues to start the discussion are listed. Table Blocks would 
    serve as a wonderful framework for such discussions. It and 7 Solutions are 
    available free on the web site. To contribute to the discussion, we are willing 
    to offer the book at discount for groups at $7.50 each for multiple orders, 
    plus S&H. Let us know if there are other ways in which we can be of help. 
  </p>
  <p>Sincerely yours, <br>

<p><strong>Blog #248. December 10, 2003: Charter Schools People have asked about 
  Charter Schools</strong>
<p>Many in our community believe they are what are needed to rescue our children 
  from a school system that won’t. Here are excerpts from Black columnist Suzzane 
  Fields, Chartering the future, 11-20-03, which gives us food for thought as 
  she discusses the new book by Abigail Thernstrom and Stephan Thernstrom &#8220;No 
  Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning” (excerpts with emphasis added):
<blockquote> 
  <p>The most troubling example of racial inequality in America today is the inner 
    city school. Civil-rights iniquities begin here. </p>
  <p>&#8230;You don&#8217;t hear the educationist bureaucrats in the big cities, who 
    pull down salaries wildly disproportionate to their talents and responsibilities, 
    crying for the pain of what the schools are doing to black children. White 
    liberals usually don&#8217;t want to clean up the wreckage because if they did they 
    wouldn&#8217;t have convenient objects to pity to prove how compassionate they are. 
  </p>
  <p>But we&#8217;re beginning to hear from educators who have looked closely 
    at the data and see a consistent pattern in the awful gap that separates achieving 
    whites and Asians and failing blacks&#8230;The Thernstroms conclude that equal 
    opportunity can be achieved only when the minority students in the inner cities 
    reach a higher academic achievement. </p>
  <p>The gapin academic achievement that we see today is actually worse than it 
    was 15 years ago.&#8221; </p>
  <p>The problem, the Thernstroms say, is not the lack of a racial mix in public 
    schools. Nor is it the amount of money spent per child or the size of teacher 
    salaries. What&#8217;s crucial to enabling children to learn is an educational environment 
    that motivates kids to want to work and study hard. Such an environment requires 
    teachers who are imaginative and innovative, whose careers are not governed 
    by rigid union rules and whose hiring and firing is community based, where 
    teachers, administrative staff and parents work together. [See Blog # on Expectations] 
  </p>
  <p>The best kept secret in education is that almost all of the achieving inner-city 
    schools are charter schools, operating within the public school system. They&#8217;re 
    financed by the public and held to public accountability but are freed from 
    the bureaucratic wrangling that strangled the public system. Unfortunately, 
    charter schools require a great deal of time and private energy, and suffer 
    from many of the shortcomings of voucher programs. They draw money away from 
    the vested interests. </p>
  <p>&#8230;Capital City Public Charter School in Washington, which opened in 
    2001, exemplifies what a dedicated group of adults can accomplish for a diverse 
    group of children enrolled in classes ranging from prekindergarten to the 
    eighth grade. The school is small, and its racially diverse student body is 
    composed of a majority of low-income families. Parents choose the school. 
    The staff operates on a theory that emphasizes project-based instruction to 
    help children meet rigorous academic standards. They meet them, too. </p>
  <p>&#8230;Charter schools are a compromise between the fat and exhausted public 
    schools and the more controversial vouchers that enable parents to transfer 
    their children from bad to good public schools. Schools that don&#8217;t shape up 
    fail. Charter schools, like vouchers, are innovative and offer fresh opportunities 
    for turning around the racial gap in learning. They&#8217;re worth trying and watching. 
    They brook no excuses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the failure of the MPS to close the gaps, can we any longer afford to 
  wait? Martin Luther King said no. And certainly we condemn our children to a 
  life of being behind, of automatic lack of access to life success when they 
  can’t read and write. All that stands between our kids and their success is 
  their school system and the adults and political party that runs it.

<p><strong><a name="03247b1209"></a>Blog #247. December 9, 2003: The emergency re young Black men also 
  has counterparts with young women. </strong>
<p>An article in the <a href=http://www.louisvillecardinal.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/12/02/3fcc3bd7d491c target="_blank"> 
  Louisville Cardinal newspaper</a> of the University of Louisville reminds us 
  that the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a> is NOT just about young Black men (see Blogs 
  ), as it includes young Black women as well. So when we wrote <a href="../../solutionpapers/19higherhopes.htm">Higher 
  Hopes For Youth Than Hip Hop</a>, please know that it refers to women as well 
  as men. 
<p>We are reminded of this by Sister Souljah in a campus appearance at Louisville 
  University in October. You remember the run in 1992 between Sister Souljah and 
  then candidate for President Bill Clinton. Back then she said &#8220;Why not have 
  a week and kill white people?&#8221; and then Candidate Bill famously criticized her 
  at a meeting of Jesse Jackson&#8217;s Rainbow Coalition, prompting Jackson to sputter 
  and Americans to think Clinton may be all right. Well, she is at it again. In 
  her October 2003 University of Louisville speech, she again has had a lasting 
  effect, albeit a negative one. She made very sexist put downs regarding black 
  women. Given the put downs women take in gangsta rap and some hip hop, we need 
  to understand that these lyrics and attitudes degrade our sisters. But when 
  Sister Souljah not only repeats these but they are taken as gospel by our young 
  sisters, we have an emergency regarding young women too. Here is a quote from 
  the article cited above, as it reports that a woman student (emphasis added), 
  a senior communication major, said that Sister Souljah talked about how black 
  women represent themselves, how they act when they are with their boyfriends 
  or trying to pursue men, how society makes black women and how black women accept 
  that they&#8217;re &#8220;hoochies,&#8221; &#8220;sluts,&#8221; &#8220;whores&#8221; and &#8220;bitches.&#8221; &#8220;She said that.&#8221; All 
  I could say was &#8220;Ouch. I can&#8217;t get angry because it&#8217;s the truth and the 
  truth hurts.&#8221; 
<p>What do we stand for when we say nothing when a Black woman says that it is 
  the “truth” that Black women are &#8220;hoochies,&#8221; &#8220;sluts,&#8221; &#8220;whores&#8221; and &#8220;bitches&#8221;? 
  And this was a part of presentations nearly two hours long that was full of 
  hateful remarks about White people in a speech billed as a “diversity” speech. 
  First, “diversity” is supposed to be about uniting different people, finding 
  that “common ground.” Hate speech divides. It is not diversity. It is not acceptable. 
  And would Blacks sit back if a White person spoke hatefully for nearly two hours 
  about Blacks? Any who stand by and say nothing have lost not only their moral 
  authority, but have lost their understanding of what it means to keep their 
  eye on the prize and to work for attaining that prize. We cannot build true 
  self-respect by hating others or ourselves (Sister Souljah essentially showed 
  that she hated herself too by calling Black women &#8220;hoochies,&#8221; &#8220;sluts,&#8221; &#8220;whores&#8221; 
  and &#8220;bitches.&#8221;. Controversy is fine, and telling truth to power and not surgar 
  coating is fine. But the goal has to be to bring people together so that what 
  is wrong can be righted. So it’s not just the guys that have “gotten” the message 
  rapped in hip hop on MTV. The young women have too. There is a lot of work to 
  be done to deal with the state of emergency of Black youth, both young men and 
  young women. Part of that work is outlined in my book and organized into action 
  steps based on the book in both <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> and in <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven 
  Solutions</a>.

<p><strong><a name="03246b1208"></a>Blog #246. December 8, 2003 Mediation Headlines:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Minneapolis police, community reps will sign mediation agreement </li>
  <li>Minneapolis police sign pact with community leaders</li>
  <li>Minneapolis police mediation pact OK&#8217;d </li>
</ul>
<p>Historic “Landmark” Mediation Agreement Signed Can we do that? Yes we can. 
  Can they do that? Yes they can. It’s time we began to think more “we can” than 
  “can we?” 
<p>Old Gospel Spirituals talk about the New Jerusalem. We want to talk about a 
  New Minneapolis, a city for everyone, a city that makes a place at the table 
  for all its citizens. Let us all celebrate that what was called impossible became 
  possible, and then lets plan to work together again and again to make what people 
  call impossible possible. Let us continue to work together to create a new vision 
  to make a New Minneapolis, a city of possibilities. Here are key excerpts from 
  the Strib stories above: 
<ul>
  <li>Any thought of a serious federal mediation effort to improve relations between 
    Minneapolis police and community members was little more than a pipe dream 
    a year ago. </li>
  <li>[The] agreement is&#8230;divided into 14 sections ranging from use of force 
    to accountability of police officers. </li>
  <li>the agreement addresses issues ranging from use of force and diversifying 
    the workplace to trauma caused by removing children from their homes. A key 
    element of the agreement is the creation of a police-community relations council 
    that will help to ensure compliance. </li>
  <li>Other topics the agreement will cover include police-community relations, 
    mental health, cultural awareness and sensitivity, racially biased policing, 
    accountability of police officers, training, equipment, and budget. But Bethel, 
    who declined to discuss specifics, said this &#8220;is a landmark document that 
    won&#8217;t kill all the community&#8217;s frustrations.&#8221; </li>
  <li>The community team that was involved in mediation included representatives 
    from the African-American, American Indian, Laotian, religious, mental health, 
    university, and gay, lesbian and transgendered communities. Olson, two precinct 
    inspectors, sergeants and officers represented the department. </li>
  <li>Mediation team members say the document&#8217;s effect will come through 
    policy changes, training of officers and education for the communities who 
    were represented during negotiations. </li>
  <li>But just as important are the relationships that were built through frank 
    discussions and knocking down misconceptions of how cops do their jobs. Remember 
    what brought us to the table was the department&#8217;s history of inhumane 
    policy culture and institutional racism,&#8221; said the Rev. Ian Bethel, spokesman 
    for the community team. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t about bashing officers.&#8221; </li>
  <li>a 24-page agreement that its creators hope will be the new blueprint to 
    improve strained police-community relations just as important are the relationships 
    that were built through frank discussions and knocking down misconceptions 
    of how cops do their jobs. </li>
  <li>&#8220;This agreement is the perfect springboard for the next chief that 
    comes in,&#8221; Olson said. </li>
  <li>City Council&#8230;approval appears to be virtually certain at a Dec. 15 
    meeting. </li>
  <li>Mayor R.T. Rybak said the agreement was a reason to celebrate. [Chief] Olson 
    assured the council members that the financial impact of implementing the 
    agreement won&#8217;t burden future budgets. </li>
  <li>The agreement needs to be approved by the full City Council Dec. 15, but 
    that will most likely be only a formality. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blog #246. December 7, 2003: Mayor on Mayor: Sharon on RT in City Pages</strong>
<p>In the November 24 <em>City Pages</em>, we are treated to an interview with 
  Sharon Sayles Belton commenting on the her successor. We congratulate Sharon 
  on her new work at the Humphrey Institute to study how changing demographics 
  in Minnesota link to racism. She points out the need for the current Mayor to 
  connect with the communities of color and how the Mayor seems to be advised 
  to not meet with certain activists, which, of course, is how to disconnect. 
  The article has an excellent explanation of why she who should have beaten RT 
  lost instead. It was good to see much of what is written in The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes, is validated by yet another commentary on the processes 
  of our fair city.

<p><strong>Blog #245. December 7, 2003: Remembering Pearl Harbor</strong>
<p>Remember Freedom is for Everyone. 62 years ago this morning, Pearl Harbor was 
  attacked. That was an act of terrorism in a global war. We fought World War 
  II and freed many people enslaved by despots and dictators of totalitarian states. 
  On 9/11 we experienced another act of terrorism in yet another global war. Many 
  still live enslaved by despots and dictators of totalitarian states. We pause 
  to wish for as many peaceful ways as possible to free enslaved peoples. May 
  we not forget the lessons of Pearl Harbor nor of 9/11, and may we all wage peace 
  to help turn back those forces that engage in such acts of terror. There were 
  those who disagreed with our response in 1941 just as those who disagree with 
  our response in 2001. But let us never disagree on the cause and right of freedom 
  for everyone, and work to find the common ground necessary to make that dream 
  possible for everyone, in the United States and around the world.

<p><strong>Blog #244. December 4, 2003: The Mayor’s Mediation Jive Talk </strong>
<p>The mediation agreement worked out over the past seven and a half months is 
  one of the most comprehensive in the history of mediation. Minneapolis will 
  again lead the way, either in showing what could be done or in showing how to 
  squash what could be done, as already the Mayor is putting forth the jive talk 
  regarding “well, we just hope we have the money.” Obviously, it’s not whether 
  the city has the money but whether it will allocate what it has for this purpose. 
  There is a difference between not having the money and not wanting to spend 
  it on something. Why do they think we don’t know the difference? The federation 
  and its allies pushed for reverting to the Mayor’s private mediation approach 
  that the Mayor can control. But cooler heads have prevailed. 
<p>We look forward to the signing of the Federal Mediation agreement between Minneapolis 
  Police and representatives of various communities that is scheduled for this 
  morning, Thursday, December 4, 2003, at 9:30 am at the Minneapolis Urban League&#8217;s 
  Northside Office. We are glad that the City has not decided to risk putting 
  the police department into Federal Receivership by cutting off its nose to spite 
  its face. We all look forward to better relations in the future as we all work 
  together to make Minneapolis a safe place for all its law abiding citizens. 
  And given the fact that the mediation group consisted of representatives of 
  the mayor, the council, and the police, it is unfortunate that some felt they 
  had to attempt to cause further delay in a rear guard action of discontents. 
  Well, there will always be two sides to every issue For seven months we hashed 
  them out to find the common ground. We found it. 
<p>We invite those who were skeptical to read the agreement, to recognize how 
  fair it is to all sides, and to celebrate that something of this magnitude for 
  the benefit of all in our fair city could be worked out by representatives of 
  the mayor, the council, and the police. Lets all work together to make it work.

<p><strong><a name="03243b1203"></a>Blog #243. December 3, 2003: Doug Grow and the Strib, Bad Santa and 
  his little partner in crime </strong>
<p>In his December 19, 2002 column, a year ago, Doug Grow mocked and made fun 
  of the mediation process and the community. He called us akin to Abbott and 
  Costello. Doug wrote “Like a comedy routine without the comedy.” He goes on 
  to say “Minneapolis Police Mediation morass has a feel of finger pointed players,” 
  inferring that we were confused or not telling the truth. Had Doug read the 
  copy of my book given to him, especially Chapter 16, he would have known there 
  was no confusion, no falsehoods. As we tried to mediate, the Strib, because 
  of the truth, decided to attack us and play naysayer, as the Strib was part 
  of those who told the federal mediator it not only can’t be done it won’t be 
  done. So the Strib, through Doug, wrote, “Abbott and Costello could not have 
  come up with anything more bizarre” regarding the selection process. He then 
  gets in his shot at me by saying that: 
<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a mess. Ron Edwards says one thing, Jerry McAffee says another, Clyde 
    Bellecourt says something completely different. Upset men of color point accusing 
    fingers at two White attorneys, and the Mayor says almost nothing. This would 
    be almost funny except at the root of this farce is a serious problem. Almost 
    anyone with a pulse will tell you there is a need for serious trust between 
    police and large portions of the city’s population. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having gotten away with that, the Strib then wrote an editorial: “Mediation: 
  There is much to learn from St. Paul” (and I appreciate them honoring my birthday 
  that way with their editorial on January 10, 2003. The Strib’s editorial board 
  wrote: “In Minneapolis some city council members and the mayor express suspicion 
  after community activist Ron Edwards invited Patricia Campbell Glenn to Minneapolis. 
  At a hearing last fall the council questioned Glenn openly, wondering whether 
  she intended to mediate or prosecute on behalf of the federal government.” Why 
  the smear? Again, the Strib editors and Doug had my book. It was all spelled 
  out in Chapter 16. No mystery. Nothing suspicious. Very much out in the open. 
  As we wish the Strib would be. The Strib infers that the St. Paul NAACP president, 
  Nick Kalief had done the same thing: “For starters the political egos and turf 
  issues seem to be much more intense in the larger of the Twin Cities, and when 
  the St. Paul NAACP leader invited a federal mediator to help it was a no brainer 
  that two of the city’s most prominent civil rights organizations, namely the 
  NAACP and the Urban League ought to be involved.” It is also no mystery as to 
  why the NAACP and Urban League in Minneapolis were not included at first. Again, 
  its all in my book: read chapter 14. Then the Strib “promoted” Spike Moss and 
  chose him as the spokesman and then associated “suspicion” with Ron Edwards. 
  Why do they do that? What is their motivation? My motivation is clear. Read 
  Chapter 16: my motivation is to save lives. What is the Strib trying to save, 
  other than the fact that they don’t want six different descriptions of the elephant 
  in their living room, racism, as they want only their own blind description. 
  Too bad. The Strib used to do so well. Its a gorgeous world with some wonderful 
  people in it for them to see if they at the Strib would just open their eyes 
  as they did with their magnificent series in 1990. Time to open their eyes again.

<p><strong><a name="03242b1203"></a>Blog #242. December 3, 2003: To accept the report or not, 
  that is the Federation and Council’s question. The answer should be a no brainer: 
  accept. So why are they hesitating? </strong>
<p>Federation sabotage and council steps to maneuver the unraveling of the mediation 
  will not be new. Not only will this show no deference or appreciation for the 
  Chief under whose watch it took place, it would show a lack of respect for the 
  communities of color and their efforts as well. Going back to square one will 
  not enhance the City or its leaders. The mediation process was never about the 
  Chief but about the department regardless of who is chief. Not to complete and 
  sign will be a disservice to the new Chief. It will hobble him or her, create 
  a further divide between the police and the community, but then some would rather 
  cut off their noses to spite their faces and the community they serve rather 
  than allow all to save face as well as save body and soul. There is no end to 
  the sacrifice of the common good willing to be made by those who view the commons 
  as theirs as they in turn seem to want the Black community to know and keep 
  its place, in its own commons, but not THE commons.

<p><strong>Blog #241. December 2, 2003: Is race an identity as a biological or 
  social/cultural construct, or what? </strong>
<p>The evening news show Nightline on Friday, November 21, 2003, ran a show on 
  How do you define race? There is a company that offers Ancestry by DNA, a test 
  that can be used, for example, to find out just how much of us is African or 
  something else. It is an interesting question. Nightline asks : “Is your race 
  defined by society or by scientists or by how you see yourself?” Then, “Is race 
  a biological or social construct?&#8230;questions about science versus social 
  organization.” This question is raised within the context of Terrorists who 
  are targeting Americans, regardless of their race. 
<p>The question of race in America is the one that still defines us in a way that 
  no other question does. At a time when Americans are fighting and dying overseas, 
  Wayne Joseph points out that only Americans are consumed with racial identity. 
  When terrorists target Americans, they are not targeting African Americans, 
  Hispanic Americans or Asian Americans; they are targeting Americans. It is here 
  at home where we have had the hardest time looking beyond what we define as 
  our racial differences. 
<p>Obviously, as Dr. King always reminded both Whites and Blacks, the issue is 
  not color but character, not ethnicity but community. We need a new vision for 
  a new Minneapolis, to build on all that has come before. We need to work together 
  to, Black and White, following The Golden Rule (Chapter 5 of The Minneapolis 
  Story) as we use <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to implement <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Solutions Vision</a> so we can build a New Minneapolis together.

<p><strong>Blog #240. December 2, 2003: It ain’t race, it ain’t gender, it ain’t 
  credentials: its results that count. Who has gotten them and who has not? And 
  why? And what can we do about it? </strong>
<p>We have seen that both White and Black mayors could change affordable housing 
  programs to affluent gentrified housing. We have had a White and a Black Superintendent 
  who couldn’t/wouldn’t close the gap in test scores and keep them from falling. 
  We have had male and female, gay and straight. What has been the one common 
  denominator: either incompetence or a belief African Americans can’t make it 
  so why bother? There are no other explanation for the gaps in education, jobs, 
  and housing, unless you claim we are just too dumb. And although thought, science 
  doesn’t bear it out. What it does bear out is a pattern of 400 years of teaching 
  helplessness. We need to change that to “learned optimism” (see book of the 
  same title by Martin E.P. Seligman). We also know that all White or all Black 
  isn’t the answer either. Atlanta shows what a city can do when both exert positive 
  leadership (see Chapter 17 and Conclusion). Education is the beginning point 
  of fixing our problems (see Chapter 5). We can fix the problems. We can come 
  together as a community to find the common ground needed to fix what is broken 
  (see Chapter 5). But first Whites have to let us help fix their problems just 
  as we as Blacks must let Whites help us fix ours. If we can help each other, 
  then we can heal. Then we can all succeed. Then we are truly community. So how 
  should we proceed? How about we follow follow The Golden Rule (Chapter 5 of 
  The Minneapolis Story) in using <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to implement <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Solutions Vision</a>, so we can build a New Minneapolis together.

<p><strong>Blog #239. December 1, 2003: Let’s bring JFK’s “Watchmen on the walls 
  of world freedom” to the streets of our inner cities. </strong>
<p>On Thursday, Nov. 21, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He 
  was to speak in Dallas at the Trade Mart. This is from the speech he was to 
  have given that day. Honoring it and following it is a good way to honor his 
  memory, especially in this day of war: 
<blockquote>
<p>We in this country, in this generation, are&#8212;by destiny rather than by choice&#8212;the 
    watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be 
    worthy of our power and responsibility&#8212;that we may exercise our strength 
    with wisdom and restraint&#8212;and that we may achieve in our time and for all 
    time the ancient wisdom of &#8216;peace on earth, good will toward men.&#8217; That must 
    always be our goal&#8212;and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie 
    our strength. For as was written, &#8216;Except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen 
    waketh but in vain.&#8217; &#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been a uniquely American experiment, by both Democratic and Republican 
  presidents, as the U.S., under Presidents Bush, Clinton and Bush have freed 
  and then brought forms of democracy to Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and 
  now Iraq. We in the United States understand the significance of the war of 
  terror that has struck in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Bombay, Mombassa, Najaf, 
  Jerusalem, Riyadh, Baghdad, and Istanbul&#8221; in just the last year. We who are 
  descendents of slaves understand the terrorism visited upon our ancestors, as 
  seen in Interludes 6, 8, 13, 14, and 15 of my book, <i>The Minneapolis Story, 
  Through My Eyes.&#8221;</i> So as we “right” past wrongs in the Middle East, I still 
  maintain that that there are still wrongs yet to right in the inner cities of 
  America in general and Minneapolis in particular, especially in the areas of 
  education, jobs, housing, public safety, etc. I again comend my 7 Solutions 
  piece as a way we can all use together to bring the fruits of freedom and democracy 
  to the inner city as well, not just to Middle Eastern nations.
