<p><strong>7-7-14:  <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2014/blogs/1407jul.htm" target="_blank">Will Mayor and Chief walking in street lead to substance or just more show?</a></strong></p>
<p>Will  they inspire a pause for when the Major League All Star Game is in town?</p>
<p>Tuesday,  July 2, 2014, at noon, the Minneapolis Mayor, with the Chief of Police, will  walk the streets of North Minneapolis. They are welcome during this period of  significant violence and tension, as Minneapolis has just experienced two days  of mayhem and : 9 shot, 2 killed, 4 injured, all within a period of 12 hours  (see Star Tribune, 7-7-014, Aggravated assaults rise in Minneapolis). Friday  and Saturday night groups of 75-100 African American young men squared off and  fought each other. See my column of May, 15, 2014 #20 (&ldquo;Safe streets promoted  for White baseball. Selective reporting keeps the true level of violence  concealed&rdquo;). What was planned, if anything, at the May 1, 2014 &ldquo;Gang summit in  Minneapolis. Preparing for summer 2014&rdquo;?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>7-7-14:  Mannifesto of Peace: </strong>a  community response to community mayhem and city hesitancy. The Community  Standards Initiative will hold a meeting Wednesday, July 9, 2014.</p>
<p>The  spectre of violence that has been haunting Minneapolis that we have warned  about in our various platforms (column, books, Blog Radio show, public access  TV, will need more that a prayerful &ldquo;Please Jesus, help us&rdquo; (the ministers have  disappeared). It will need more than a brief PR walkathon by the Mayor and  Chief of Police. Needed is not urging people to put down their guns but to give  them a reason as to why they should act peaceably. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since  1995 designation of Minneapolis as Murderapolis. But we still have a long way  to go. </p>
<p>Needed  instead are non-violent peace programs that prepare young people for a peaceful  and prosperous future through educations, training, and jobs, and not  discrimination, drugs, and desertion. Blacks in the suburbs are as afraid as  are the whites. When will Twin City safety net organizations (corporate  philanthropies, churches and charities, non-profit and non-government  organizations, and state, county and city safety net agencies, going to stop  their carousel of conventions and meetings and instead develop a frontal  forward assault in order to fight the status quo that seeks to keep Blacks  dependent because of mediocre education, increasing not reducing unqualified  blacks, and lack of living wage jobs, as too many whites still too often hang  out &ldquo;blacks need not apply&rdquo; signs, as seen in how few Blacks are working on  major construction sites as roads, commercial buildings, and, most angering,  not only a lack of jobs for Blacks on the new Vikings Stadium but a lack of any  attempt to make such hires.</p>
<p>My  suggestion: start with these 47 Solution Papers, with suggestions for reducing  the city&rsquo;s average of 43 homicides a year.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>In Memorium</strong><br>
  <strong>Of</strong><br>
  <strong>The Rev. Dr.  Lillian Anthony</strong><br>
  By R. A.  Edwards<br>
  Colleague,  Friend, And Fellow Civil Rights Movement Advocate<br>
  Mentored by  Lillian Anthony</p>
<p>As  saddened as we are by the passing of The Rev. Dr. Lillian Anthony, June 23, 2014,  we celebrate with joy and thanksgiving her life in the active efforts for civil  rights, social justice, and reflective programs in the Presbyterian Church,  USA, which celebrates her life in a service July 11, 2014..</p>
<p>Lillian  Anthony was ordained into the ministry of the Presbyterian Church USA, July 25,  1993, serving the national staff until retirement as <a href="http://archive.wfn.org/1996/05/msg00131.html" target="_blank"><strong>Associate for  Affirmative Action and Equal Employment.</strong></a> History will remember Dr  Anthony as a visionary, as a tenacious fighter for civil and human rights, and,  for forty years, a person of conscience on behalf of the Presbyterian Church,  USA. She was known across the wider Presbyterian Church USA for her work during  and for her commitment to justice and advocacy.</p>
<p>I  remember the first time I met Ms. Anthony. I was a young eager beaver, 28 years  old, about to become the Vice Chair of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission  due to her support of me against those who opposed my appointment. I have been  forever grateful for her friendship, fellowship and over all support and wise  guidance, which allowed her active Civil Rights Department and my Civil Rights  Commission to make a difference carrying out the direction and dream expressed  by Mayor Arthur Naftalin in his historic address to the Minneapolis City  Council, June 30, 1963.</p>
<p>But  it took 5 years of tireless work on her part and that of the Mayor to obtain  the implementation of the ordinance to establish the department and the  commission. The resistance she and the mayor overcame remains today, as do  principles stood for, her commitment to the advocacy of justice and civil  rights, clearly continuing action points for those seeking to achieve full  social justice and an end to purposeful discrimination on the basis of color. Those  of us she mentored continue to work for this end. </p>
<p>She  was honored February 20, 1990, for her role in the development of he  Minneapolis Ordinance on Civil Rights and the Minneapolis Department of Civil  Rights. Lillian Anthony had a significant hand in the drafting of the  Minneapolis Ordinance, which also established the Department of Civil Rights  and the Civil Rights Commission.</p>
<p>I  also remember how awed I was when I first saw her home museum of Black History.  She understood the need to remember our history and to keep our memories clear  and not take our eyes of the prize of full freedom. The mini-museum she built  in her home helped her and all of us who saw it to literally keep our eyes on  the prize of freedom. </p>
<p>Dr.  Anthony&rsquo;s life, including her mini-museum, remind us of the need in every  community -- and, dare we suggest it, every major church &ndash; a museum that helps  us to remember and not forget. If the history of our struggle is not  remembered, it didn&rsquo;t exist. If it is not understood, it won&rsquo;t be ended. As a  member of the board of directors of the Association of African American Museums  recently stated, in discussing the new, major museum in Atlanta, &ldquo;We're going  backward, not forward with the civil rights movement. &hellip; The whole future of  this country is for different communities who care about social justice to get  together, and work together.&rdquo; Dr. Anthony would shout a hearty &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  Dr. Anthony, the question of race and social justice remained at the top of her  list of priorities, especially as she brought that method to the Presbyterian  Church, USA. All her life she worked to help the church make a difference  working for social justice.</p>
<p>Dr.  Anthony understood the principles of compassion and fairness. She knew the  importance of not forgetting our history. As she stated at the 10th anniversary  celebration of the Slave Memorial at Mount Vernon, VA, September 18, 1993, &ldquo;The  memory of our ancestors who are buried here is a tribute not only to the  survival of a people but a tribute to our continued gifts to the world.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The  Rev. Dr. Anthony has now embarked on her final journey We all pass this way  once in life. We look at her journey with pride, and remember her wisdom and  compassion that inspired others to take that journey as well. </p>
<p>May  God&rsquo;s hand be upon Dr. Anthony&rsquo;s shoulders and ours, and may we applaud her  achievements in the name of all.</p>
