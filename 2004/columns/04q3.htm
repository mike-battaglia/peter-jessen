<p><strong><a name="0419c0923" id="0419c0923"></a>September 23, 2004 Column #19: A new toughness 
  in the Civil Rights Department</strong> <strong>As a result, forces of reversal 
  spring into action</strong><br>
  2004</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> In the September 9 edition of this newspaper, Isaac Peterson III authored 
  a front-page story about Jayne Khalifa, the new director of the Minneapolis 
  Civil Rights Department (&quot;Mpls Civil Rights charts new course&quot;), and 
  Pauline Thomas followed with a column on the community support Ms. Khalifa needs 
  (September 16).</p>
<p> Ms. Thomas' comments were on point and timely. Here is why. Prior to her appointment 
  on July 1, 2004, we all wondered if Ms. Khalifa possessed the toughness to do 
  battle with the barracudas that swim city hall's corridors of power, barracudas 
  that leave in their wake the bones of past directors. We wonder no more. </p>
<p> We are pleasantly surprised by the aggressiveness and vision of Ms. Khalifa, 
  tough yet gracious, tough yet diplomatic. This has caused the forces of reversal 
  and nullification to spring into action. </p>
<p> The first force of reversal and nullification to act is the Minneapolis Charter 
  Commission, which will be holding a public hearing on September 29 to consider 
  significant changes to the charter, changes that would forever eliminate the 
  effectiveness of the Civil Rights Department and, thus, the Minneapolis Civil 
  Rights Commission. </p>
<p> Not since the days of the late Ike Watkins (who, as chairman of the Charter 
  Commission, stopped all attempts to circumvent and to water down the civil rights 
  ordinances) have we had such a bold play as the one being advanced by the Charter 
  Commission. Part of this is because we have not had a sentinel to watch over 
  the Charter Commission since the death of Mr. Watkins a couple of years ago. 
</p>
<p> A second force of reversal and nullification is seen in the defiance of both 
  the board and the staff of the Civilian Review Authority, who don't want to 
  recognize the authority of Ms. Khalifa. Once it appeared that she could not 
  be compromised nor intimidated, a coalition of these forces of reversal and 
  nullification came together to undermine her position and, by extension, further 
  fracture the civil rights ordinance and, therefore, the civil rights of the 
  citizens. </p>
<p> This raises serious questions about (1) the timing of the Charter Commission's 
  interest, (2) the lack of a well-publicized notice of the upcoming public hearing 
  of September 29, and (3) the defiance of the Civilian Review Authority to recognize 
  and respect the office of the director of the Civil Rights Department. </p>
<p> This is not hearsay. We were present during the public hearings of 2002 regarding 
  the authority and supervision of the office of the director over the civilian 
  review board operations, including its staff. Now that they see that Ms. Khalifa 
  cannot be compromised, they refuse to recognize and respect her authority. As 
  we pull these covers back, we see again the business-as-usual plantation politics. 
  Stay tuned.</p>
<p> <strong>We've been Scrooged<br>
  </strong>The decision by the Target Corporation to eliminate the Salvation Army 
  bell ringers during the Christmas holidays, as reported in the Minneapolis and 
  St. Paul major newspapers a week ago, really makes one wonder about the Dayton 
  family's vaunted commitment to humanity and caring. </p>
<p> Has the new generation of the Dayton family become so mean and uncaring and 
  not needlessly &quot;politically correct&quot; that they are willing to stand 
  by and say nothing as a proud family heritage of five percent is turned into 
  that of Scrooge's zero percent, as Target humbugs the small charitable giving 
  contributions that provide a significant amount of caring in our community? 
</p>
<p> Has the Salvation Army's ringing of the bell and receiving a dime here and 
  a dollar there so punctured and disturbed the profits of a once-great corporation 
  that they do this to ring the bells of Wall Street? Why does Target cower before 
  the Salvation Army's ringing bells? Are church bells in neighborhoods that have 
  Target stores next? </p>
<p> As this column has pointed out before, Target has not minded ringing its own 
  bell for gifts and contributions from the City. And they really rang the gift 
  bell with their downtown HQ and store. They didn't mind silencing the bells 
  of North</p>
<p> Minneapolis, pulling their store out and going back on their promise of giving 
  back to the community that had and continues to give so much to it. </p>
<p> We had high expectations of the spirit of giving and truth. Target has Scrooged 
  us, just as they Scrooged Detroit, pocketing the tax write-offs made up by us 
  shopper taxpayers. </p>
<p> So now it is time to Scrooge them. We won't be Christmas shopping this year 
  at any Scrugett. We'll look for stores to shop in where bell ringers still ring 
  for caring and humanity.</p>
<p> <strong>Congrats in order</strong><br>
  Congratulations to Valerie Wurster, who just became the first African American 
  woman to become Minneapolis Deputy Chief of Police, and to Medaria Arrandondo 
  for his promotion to inspector.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0418c0909" id="0418c0909"></a>September 9, 2004 Column #18: The betrayal 
of a trust, the fracturing of an institution</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> On August 18, 2004, at 9:15 am and 9:17 am, Brett Buckner, president of the 
  Minneapolis Branch NAACP, created one of the most embarrassing moments of the 
  appellate and supreme courts of the State of Minnesota by sending out emails 
  from the court's office about cases pending before the courts. </p>
<p> Working with Sandra Miller, the judicial administrative assistant for the 
  chief judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, Mr. Buckner and Ms. Miller disseminated 
  a very well-crafted plan to harass and ultimately force out their opposition. 
  In the 9:17 am email, Mr. Buckner calls for forcing out the NAACP appointed 
  branch administrator, Mr. Carl Breeding. Mr. Breeding has been under intense 
  attack by Mr. Buckner; by Rev. Gill Ford, NAACP regional administrator; and 
  even by some members of the national NAACP board of directors. Could our local 
  branch and national NAACP be more out of touch with reality?</p>
<p> In the 9:15 am email, Mr. Buckner calls for the removal of 26 members of the 
  local NAACP for having filed a lawsuit against the branch regarding the 2002 
  elections. One of the individuals identified in the email who has played a role 
  in the ongoing cover-up of the local chapter's affairs was Claudel Washington, 
  NAACP State Conference president, Minnesota-Dakota Branch, located in Duluth. 
</p>
<p> Although Mr. Buckner has been asked to step down, he resists doing so. Although 
  a financial audit (which for four years we have called for) is supposed to take 
  place, will it? We don't understand why Mr. Breeding will be removed by the 
  end of October, as problems obviously still exist. </p>
<p> The current negotiations with the state of Minnesota and the federal government 
  in regards to the program known as the Parent Information Centers, which are 
  under the custody and control of the Minneapolis Branch of the NAACP, strikes 
  us as negotiating with the fox guarding the hen house after he has already dined 
  on the hens. </p>
<p> Truly sad, disturbing and offending is the direct interference by the local 
  branch of the NAACP in the trial of Alfred Flowers before the Supreme Court 
  (see story in the 9/2/04 Star Tribune). Mr. Flowers and his attorneys have filed 
  a petition for writ of supervisory control because of the interference in the 
  judiciary process by the NAACP. </p>
<p> The NAACP would deny Mr. Flowers and his sister a fair trial in a Minnesota 
  state court. In a document filed August 25, 2004, Mr. Flowers gives a chilling 
  narrative of the judiciary interference and obstruction by Mr. Buckner and the 
  NAACP. They have also interfered in a second legal matter that is pending in 
  the Hennepin County District Court before Judge Kathleen Anderson. </p>
<p> The NAACP's ability to compromise high-ranking judiciary offices and prestigious 
  law firms represents a serious betrayal and fracturing of an institution known 
  as the courts and a doctrine known as justice free from interference and obstruction. 
  Why do the NAACP officers act as gods on Mt. Olympus, able to do whatever they 
  want, including betraying the trust placed in them and fracturing the institutions 
  of justice?</p>
<p> <strong>The NAACP and Danny Glover</strong> <br>
  When will the Minneapolis Branch of the NAACP pay the $4,550.15 that is owed 
  Mr. Glover and Felix Justice, who were the keynote speakers in November of last 
  year?</p>
<p> <strong>Minneapolis city government grinds to a halt</strong> <br>
  Back in March of 2003, The Minneapolis City Council passed an ordinance embracing 
  a Code of Ethics and an Ethics Board. A year and a half later, the Ethics Board, 
  and by extension the ordinance, still have not been activated. <br>
  In a meeting on August 31, 2004, the three-member board was still talking about 
  how to get started. Note that during public testimony of January, February and 
  March, 2003, the appeal was made to have some racial balance on this ethics 
  board. The appointing authority (the chief judge of Hennepin County District 
  Court, the dean of the Minnesota Law School, and the dean of the University 
  of St. Thomas School of Law) allegedly used the City's open appointment process.<br>
  You guessed it: no person of color. White board, taking care of White folks' 
  business. City council and the mayor asleep at the switch. Business as usual. 
  Ethics of show, not substance. </p>
<p> Note our call for ethics as one of the seven in our &quot;7 Solutions&quot; 
  paper for the problems of Minneapolis on our www.TheMinneapolisStory.com website.</p>
<p> <strong>Vikings update</strong> <br>
  In four days, the Minnesota Vikings, under Red McCombs and Mike Tice, will be 
  shooting out of the tunnel for another season of Vikings football. The propagandists 
  for the local newspapers say the Vikings will be 14-2 and will win the conference, 
  division and Super Bowl titles. We'd like to know how the negotiations are going 
  for the selling the team.</p>

<p> <strong><a name="0417c0826" id="0417c0826"></a>August 26, 2004 Column #17: M</strong><strong>an 
  the lifeboats! </strong><strong>Minneapolis vessels hitting icebergs and sinking 
  all around us.</strong> <em><strong>Examples: </strong></em><strong>The USS Heritage Park (Hollman) 
  and the USS Pioneer Press: Images of the Titanic.</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> This is our tenth column on Hollman/Heritage Park since April 9, 2003. We 
  want the USS Heritage Park to sail, not sink. Yet, on July 8, 2004, the executive 
  committee of Minneapolis' Empowerment Zone, guardians of the treasury, seeming 
  cousins to the Count of Monte Crisco, attempted to upright, without pubic review, 
  the Heritage Park project. </p>
<p> On page one of the confidential Empowerment Zone Executive Committee report, 
  made around 7:35 am on July 8, the staff recommended that $2.9 million in FY2000 
  state bond funding be allocated to McCormick Baron, of St. Louis, the developer 
  of Heritage Park, to close the &quot;significant gap in funding for infrastructure 
  at Heritage Park.&quot; </p>
<p> A Hennepin County District Court ruling in the matter of the Reichold Property 
  ends bond funding in December of 2004. The money must be moved to McCormack 
  Baron to keep Heritage Park from sinking.</p>
<p> The recommendation from the staff was that &quot;by reallocating the full 
  amount,&quot; it would give Heritage Park the ability to spend all of the funding 
  this year. With great naivet&eacute;, the report says the following: &quot;We 
  would look to future legislative sessions to secure additional bond funding 
  for SEMI [a tax incentive district of the city], when the timing is appropriate,&quot; 
  as if the legislature would do so. This shows they believe &quot;the fix&quot; 
  is in, even though our judgment is that the legislature is not going to raise 
  their sinking boat. </p>
<p> Rumors are sweeping through city call about Ken Havey, executive director 
  of the Empowerment Zone, who will be bailing out (oops, resigning) in October. 
  Another rumor is that Lee Pao Xiong, project manager of Heritage Park, will 
  be departing before the end of the calendar year. Resigning? Or ousted? What 
  are the icebergs ahead?</p>
<p> Another looming iceberg is the lack of enough funds for Heritage Park environmental 
  cleanup, specifically on the south side of Olson Highway. How can this be when 
  we reported last year from official documents that over $6 million had been 
  spent on environmental cleanup? How can this be after the glowing <em>City Pages</em> 
  August 4 cover story on the heaven they see in Heritage Park?</p>
<p> How could there still be the need for environmental cleanup? What did City 
  Pages miss about Mr. Havey and Mr. Lee Xiong? It seems in this corner as if 
  someone said after that July 8 executive committee meeting, &quot;Let's do damage 
  control.&quot; Is this a new name for &quot;new job&quot; lifeboats?</p>
<p> <strong>Journalism in jeopardy</strong> </p>
<p> How is Charley Walters, <em>St. Paul Pioneer Dispatch</em> sports columnist, 
  able to continue to raise the bar on being stupid and mean-spirited? In his 
  August 15 column, he wrote, &quot;You've got to wonder how long it will take 
  Arizona Cardinals Coach Denny Green to negatively affect the personality of 
  nice-guy rookie receiver Larry Fitzgerald, Jr., of Minneapolis.&quot; </p>
<p> Are you as offended as I am? Can you imagine how offended Mr. Fitzgerald's 
  father, a long-time reporter and sports columnist for this paper, must be by 
  this blatant and malicious attempt by this core of <em>Pioneer Press</em> bigots 
  (Mr. Walters and his editors) to try to sink Larry, Jr.?</p>
<p> Why do they think they can malign and create division among African Americans, 
  particularly between generations, and especially in the world of sports? We 
  all know Larry, Jr. was a ball boy for years with the Vikings under Coach Green. 
  Who of us fathers wouldn't want our sons to have that experience under Coach 
  Green? </p>
<p> Mr. Walters has shown the level of racial bias that a columnist and his editors 
  in this town will stoop to in order to deliver the philosophy and doctrine of 
  the late great American segregationist, Senator Bilbo of Mississippi. </p>
<p> Larry Fitzgerald, Sr. is a far superior sportswriter and columnist than Mr. 
  Walters, by any objective standards. The mini-minded-mini-men-of-mini-ville 
  still rule the <em>Pioneer Press</em>. </p>
<p> In his autobiography out this month, Robert Smith writes glowingly about Coach 
  Green. And Daunte Culpepper was quoted speaking very positively about Coach 
  Green before their game Saturday. The Titanic of hate and racism that allows 
  such scurrilous nonsense to be published has not yet sunk. We can only hope 
  they find the iceberg with their name on it. Their racism and hatred deserve 
  an early and watery grave. </p>
<p> <strong>We continue to haunt</strong> <br>
  <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em> continues to sail on, through 
  the frosty icebergs of Minnesota and our leading Twin Cities papers, which continue 
  to ignore the book. </p>
<p> We called it in terms of education (public schools sinking minority students), 
  housing (Hollman/Heritage Park), jobs (Blacks can be put in jail but won't be 
  hired to build them), and public safety (shootings, federal mediation, the attacks 
  on Chief McManus), etc. We have outlined solutions for these areas in our book 
  and on our website that they ignore. <br>
  We sail. They sink. As the '60s song says, &quot;When will they ever learn?&quot; 
  Aren't they tired of sinking?</p>

<p><em> </em><strong><a name="0416c0813" id="0416c0813"></a>August 13, 2004 Column #16: MPD 
Chief unfairly targeted by Star Tribune</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> In a previous column, we touched on what we see as a war against Minneapolis 
  Police Chief William McManus by the <em>Star Tribune</em>. You've not seen any 
  mention of this in the <em>Star Tribune</em> because it is too embarrassing 
  for them. Their city hall beat reporter, Rochelle Olsen, and her editors at 
  that once-great newspaper know what we are talking about. <br>
  Whereas the <em> Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder </em> has been doing a series 
  of fair and impartial stories on Chief McManus, the Star Tribune posits very 
  ugly dispositions against the chief, with outrageous personal and mean-spirited 
  rumors and innuendoes masquerading as &quot;journalism.&quot; </p>
<p> When legitimate reasons delayed the chief from getting his Minnesota police 
  license (there is no time limit), the Star Tribune and TV station KMSP, Channel 
  9, reported an unwarranted red herring as fact. Yellow journalism became the 
  order of the day for them, not the ethical code of fair and impartial journalism. 
  Encouraging people to advance a lie raises serious questions about the integrity 
  of this once-great paper.</p>
<p> The Star Tribune's parent company sent a University of Kansas journalism professor 
  two years ago to be a summer intern at the Star Tribune His real job? To review 
  and evaluate the newspaper's standards. He reported his findings and made his 
  recommendations to the parent company, findings that were part of why a sports 
  reporter was jettisoned a couple of months ago (for attempting to slander Dennis 
  Green during his interview process earlier this year with the Arizona Cardinals, 
  of which he is now the head football coach). </p>
<p> Let's be blunt: What reason could there be for the continued attacks on Chief 
  McManus other than the relationships he is building with communities of color? 
  Rather than say outright that this is not the right relationship for a White 
  Chief to have with Black folks, the Star Tribune pushed a lie that the chief 
  is a man who abuses relationships, doesn't communicate well, and spends too 
  much time with the field hands.</p>
<p> This is not practicing good, unbiased, honest journalism.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Paradise Found and Lost?</strong></p>
<p> <em>City Pages</em> August 8, 2004 cover story: &quot;Surprise: Heritage Park 
  Is Not Hell on Earth,&quot; by Jennifer Vogel. With a drawing of a heavenly 
  city in the clouds, the story then takes us on &quot;A tour of Minneapolis's 
  newest and most rigorously engineered neighborhood.&quot;</p>
<p> Paradise is found for <em>City Pages</em> (they have a wonderful front page 
  story, despite the negatives accompanying the positives). Paradise for McCormack 
  Baron (as the cost overruns continue, their cash flow goes up). Paradise for 
  city planners (it has been their annuity for over a decade).</p>
<p> Paradise is lost for &quot;the people.&quot; Dispersed original residents 
  not allowed back: paradise lost. Dispersed original residents who can't afford 
  the asking price: paradise lost. Taxpayers who paid an enormous amount of money 
  to &quot;engineer&quot; this paradise: lost. Residents, when the ghosts of the 
  industrial past come to haunt the post-industrial future: paradise lost. Taxpayers, 
  if the bonds don't hold: lost again. </p>
<p> If ignorance is bliss, bliss has descended on Hollman/Heritage Park, where 
  the planners followed their bliss. See the story online at <a href="http://www.citypages.com/databank/25/1235/article12350.asp" target="_blank">http://www.citypages.com/databank/25/1235/article12350.asp</a>. 
</p>
<p> <em>City Pages</em> reported that the water is not drinkable. But, would Vogel 
  allow children to play in the water? She reports that the ground is still settling 
  and some walls have cracks as a result. But she left out inconvenient facts. 
  <br>
  Fact: It doesn't report the airborne lead poisoning of the baby it wrote about 
  last year with whom a settlement is being negotiated. Fact: the black sludge 
  (we have pictures) was not from wood chips, but from the sidewalk and the ponds. 
  Fact: The woodchips were in the tot lot. Fact: There was no windstorm that blew 
  off siding. Fact: Lots of contamination was hauled out after we broke the story.</p>
<p> Vogel calls Hollman/Heritage Park the most &quot;rigorously engineered neighborhood.&quot; 
  She says the poor people (code word for Blacks) used to be told, &quot;Don't 
  go anywhere, especially not downtown.&quot; Fact: Jim Crow was a bigger &quot;engineer&quot; 
  of housing. Fact: Redlining Black neighborhoods to prevent loans was engineering. 
  Fact: Recent gerrymandering of wards is bigger engineering.</p>
<p> Fact: Minneapolis' plantation system still works&#8212;White jobs on Black backs. 
  (<em>Skyway News</em> reported a McKinsey study showing the City spent nearly 
  $1 billion in planning to get 52 units. Some say it was several hundred units; 
  still, for $1 billion? See www.skywaynews.net/archives/index.inn?loc=detail&amp;doc=/2002/June/21-2720-news0-1.txt).</p>
<p> Question: Is Vogel following the new trend reported July 31 in the L.A. Times, 
  &quot;Reviving Urban Brownfields&quot; (www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-brownfields31jul31.story) 
  to &quot;make it easier to build on California's estimated 100,000 contaminated 
  industrial and commercial properties,&#8230;most in heavily developed, rundown 
  neighborhoods&quot;? </p>
<p> The desire not &quot;to punish builders for the environmental sins of their 
  predecessors&quot; is laudatory. Yet California, like Minneapolis, is willing 
  to build over &quot;tainted underground water as long as that water is not used 
  for drinking.&quot; <br>
  But will they let their kids play in it? </p>

<p><strong><a name="0415c0729" id="0415c0729"></a>July 29, 2004 Column #15: All-White 9/11 
  Commission left a lot unanswered.</strong> <strong>A Nation Guarded or Unguarded?</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> Millions of Americans waited with great anticipation for the report of the 
  commission on the tragedy of 9/11/01 (which follows the 2003 report of the joint 
  inquiry of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and last month's Senate 
  Select Committee on Intelligence report). </p>
<p> But this is not a game of committees. The attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Iran, 
  the Beirut barracks, the Khobar Towers, the USS Cole, and the World Trade Center 
  (1994 and 9/11/01) all give stark testimony to the war on terror confronting 
  us. Those are external threats. We are also concerned about the internal threats 
  by these same legislative bodies on the inner cities. Will these now be joined?</p>
<p> What the 9/11 Commission report said and what the report didn't say will be 
  debated for years. Clearly, decisions were made to place no blame on either 
  the Clinton or Bush administrations. It is as if, by and large, this tragedy 
  that befell America was hatched in a hotel room in Singapore by some baggy-pants 
  men and succeeded because an FBI agent in Phoenix, an FBI agent in Minneapolis, 
  and some other low-level bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., didn't get it right, 
  resulting in the laundry list of attacks above.</p>
<p> It is interesting how the blame is always structural, organizational, and 
  not with the leaders of these structures and organizations. That is a lot to 
  ask. Voters will answer in November. (Or not, if either conspiracy theorists 
  or a Homeland Security-Justice Department memo discussing cancellation of elections 
  in the event of a terrorist attack are correct. All seem to expect a terrorist 
  attack; by whom is not as certain.)</p>
<p> The 9/11 Commission report calls for many things, including a mega national 
  counterterrorism center and the creation of a new Intelligence Czar, as if we 
  don't have enough. The proposed czar (also called for in previous intelligence 
  commissions and task forces that went by such names as Church, Bremmer, Hart-Rudman 
  and Gilmore) would oversee the entire intelligence apparatus of 15 separate 
  federal agencies. Isn't that what Homeland Security is for? Would this mean 
  two czars?</p>
<p> Among the proposals that make us uneasy is that if you put the CIA and the 
  FBI, the NSA, and the other 12 agencies all together, it means all would be 
  involved in both international and domestic intelligence gathering. What about 
  the charter of the CIA prohibiting it from spying on U.S. citizens inside the 
  borders of America? </p>
<p> And, for African Americans who served in the great civil rights battles of 
  the 1960s and who followed closely the assassinations of Martin Luther King, 
  Jr. and Malcolm X, we know that America's intelligence apparatus already operates 
  both within and outside the borders of this great nation. Just a thought, if 
  you will. Read the full report at <a href="http://www.startribune.com/news/911Report.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.startribune.com/news/911Report.pdf</a>.</p>

</p>
<p> So the game has begun. The game has been fixed. Or has it? Does it make a 
  difference? The distinguished panel, comprised of members from both political 
  parties, had no members of color. It was made clear that Americans of color, 
  be they Black or Hispanic or Asian, etc., were not deemed intelligent enough, 
  savvy enough, keen enough, versatile enough, or knowledgeable enough to serve 
  on a panel of such distinction.</p>
<p> Let's hope these Whites don't think of White security as important and Black 
  security as not important. This is something that should worry those of us who 
  make up the colored part of the nation. But then maybe the panel was just business 
  as usual and, as they say on the plantation, &quot;no need for you to get in 
  the middle of boss's business.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>Time to repudiate Kerner</strong></p>
<p> The deterioration of our inner cities follows government policy framed in 
  the liberal 1968 Kerner Commission Report that stated African Americans are 
  different from others and that we can't make it on our own, and thus must be 
  taken care of by the state (on the inner-city plantation). If we can't make 
  it, why bother with good education, jobs, housing, or public safety? </p>
<p> Will part of Homeland Security be to protect us from terrorists, or to protect 
  Whites from their imagined negative fantasies about us? It is long past time 
  for the Democrats and Republicans to repudiate Kerner. Will they?</p>
<p> <strong>Faith-based and the election</strong> </p>
<p> It appears there will be a lot of emphasis by the Bush administration on the 
  Black church and the political arena, as we have discussed in previous columns. 
  Look at the significant number of African Americans who have now moved into 
  ministry.</p>
<p> Understanding the protocol of faith-based funding, we recognize that for those 
  who embrace religion, their next step will be to embrace the windfall&#8212;that 
  means dollars&#8212;that will be forthcoming to those who champion the &quot;right&quot; 
  cause for whatever current administration is in power.</p>

  From Target&#8221; One Year Anniversary: How We Doing?</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p> It was just a year ago that much discussion took place with respect to the 
  announced closing of the Target store at Lyndale and Broadway and the loss of 
  jobs that went with the closing (see our column of June 18, 2003). Over a period 
  of weeks, discussions and negotiations took place between a coalition of Black 
  leaders and the corporate leadership of Target Corporation. Near the end of 
  2003, it was quietly announced that Target was going to donate $300,000 to a 
  group for the purpose of planning for the area understood by all parties as 
  West Broadway, with the priority being development leading to new jobs. That 
  was then.</p>
<p> This is now: we were rather taken back in the last ten days when we heard 
  from reliable sources that the $300,000 given to support developing the plan 
  for the area had not been spent. It is now a year later. The longer the City 
  planners plan the longer they get paid. The longer they take the longer inner 
  city residents wait for the jobs that are to come. The only plan we have heard 
  is of the various &#8220;leaders&#8221; stating their entitlement to a &#8220;share&#8221; 
  of the $300,000, as they claim entitlement to $100,000 here and $10,000 there 
  and $20,000 over there. Can someone please clarify? It is kind of like the question 
  in the film &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221;: what is the truth? Is there an answer 
  we&#8217;ll hear anytime soon? Don&#8217;t people understand that we can handle 
  the truth?</p>
<p> <strong>The future of nursing homes in the inner city.</strong> </p>
<p>Many of us were drawn to the story in the July 8th edition of the Star Tribune 
  on the disastrous plight of Concordia Care Center of Minneapolis and the filing 
  of 11 criminal negligence charges against Concordia by the Minneapolis City 
  Attorney. Some have watched in horror at the battle between Attorney General 
  Mike Hatch and the Minnesota Department of Corrections over the assigning of 
  individuals from the corrections system into our nursing homes, primarily in 
  inner city nursing homes of people of color and the danger that now exists for 
  those citizens least able to protect themselves. As the bureaucrats fiddle our 
  people are people are stuck with riddles: why isn&#8217;t there more concern 
  and aggressiveness by our elected officials? Why is it that all that seems to 
  count is not our elderly of color but the turf battle between the Attorney General 
  and the Department of Corrections? These elderly are being used as disposable 
  pawns. In this story it is the bureaus that count, not a nursing home for elderly 
  people of color. And in their righteous battle, the Attorney General and Department 
  of Corrections will cause the nursing home&#8217;s closing and the loss of all 
  of the jobs there as well, displacing both the elderly and the people of color 
  caring for them. A double whammy. Isn&#8217;t this another negative economic 
  downturn obtained by causing the loss so many jobs primarily filled by residents 
  of color of the inner city? </p>
<p> <strong>Update Kingdome Oil and Faith Based Management</strong>. </p>
<p>Are you as fascinated as we are by the faith-based protocol that has quietly 
  been put in place and bankrolled by Kingdom Oil, and where, for some time now, 
  Hamline University in St. Paul has been offering a four to six week course on 
  faith based management, proposal writing, and issues identification? We don&#8217;t 
  know the issues? Are the Republicans copying the Democrats? The liberal Kerner 
  Commission Report in 1968, on which most inner city policy is based, says we 
  descendents of slaves aren&#8217;t like other &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, can&#8217;t 
  make it on our own, and need to be taken care of by the government (hence my 
  phrase about Minneapolis: &#8220;Life on the Mississippi&#8217;s Grandest Liberal 
  Plantation&#8221;). Now we have the conservatives essentially saying the same 
  thing, that if only African Americans were just a little better educated, just 
  a little bit more astute, and a just a tad more knowledgeable about proposal 
  writing, we would have probably received our fair share. All you have to do 
  is go back to school, understand what side of the issues you should be on (the 
  side of the party providing the funding), don&#8217;t rock the boat nor bite 
  the hand that will feed you (the party &#8220;feeding&#8221; you), and vote 
  the right way (for the party that provides you some money). The Republicans 
  have learned well from the Democrats. With Republicans and Democrats, all you 
  gotta have is faith.</p>
<p> We, on the other and, have faith in the people. We have identified the issues. 
  We have proposed solutions for how to close the gaps in education, jobs, housing 
  etc, in the &#8220;Solution Papers&#8221; section of www.TheMinneapolisStory.com 
  web page (see especially #22,&#8220;Seven Themes, Seven Problems, Seven Solutions&#8221;) 
  and #23 (&#8220;The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit At 
  Together&#8221;). In these you can surely place your faith. </p>

  The Control of the Black Vote. A bigger version of Florida?</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em><br>
  <br>
  The concern expressed in the American media during election year 2000 about 
  &#8220;faith based&#8221; community social programs funded by the federal government 
  is a concerg again. Many are not aware of the extent and power of these Texas 
  programs brought to the Federal Government by George W. Bush. </p>
<p> We remember the Chief Liaison of the faith based programs, the charismatic 
  Rev. Blair, who spoke here in April and July 2001 (21 States have Liaisons or 
  Offices for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives), including his dynamic presentation 
  to over 250 participants at a Humphrey Institute meeting on the campus of the 
  University of Minnesota. A couple of weeks ago we learned that that the federal 
  faith-based folks held a dynamic two and half day event in the Western suburbs 
  of Chanhassen (the next one is in Boston, July 8), at which there was much discussion 
  about the importance and revitalization of the Black church (why in a Western 
  suburb and why didn&#8217;t more community activists know about it?). </p>
<p> When we check the White House web site, http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/fbci, 
  we read this: The goal of The White House Office and the Centers for the Faith-Based 
  and Community Initiatives is &#8220;to make sure that grassroots leaders can 
  compete on an equal footing for federal dollars, receive greater private support, 
  and face fewer bureaucratic barriers.&#8221; Key focus areas: &#8220;At-risk 
  youth, Ex-offenders, Homeless, Hungry, Substance abusers, Those with HIV/AIDS, 
  Welfare-to-work families&#8221; It is fair to ask: is this the Republican inner 
  city plantation version of the Democrat&#8217;s inner city plantation approach?</p>
<p> Our only concerns are that it indeed be a level playing field, not only in 
  terms of Whites and non-Whites but also in terms of the &#8220;favored&#8221; 
  political party in the Black community and those &#8220;not favored,&#8221; 
  and that it involve church and state and avoid church or state.</p>
<p> At Chanhassen, an entity calling itself Kingdom Oil provided not only guidance 
  and vision to the 55 &#8211; 60 ecumenical Black community ministers summoned 
  to this meeting, it also paid the $500 fee for each of them. So what is the 
  new vision and new sense of direction being shaped for the African American 
  community? Why are the Minnesota Council of Churches and Bethel College (a very 
  conservative religious college) guaranteeing the conference with Kingdom Oil 
  and playing such prominent roles?</p>
<p> We understand that the dynamic leadership of Mr. Jay Bennett, Kingdom Oil&#8217;s 
  Chairman and CEO, and the Rev. Richard Coleman, Kingdom Oil&#8217;s Chief Operations 
  Officer, is bringing a significant vision for a new Black church and a new direction, 
  politically and otherwise, for Black Americans in the inner cities. Kingdom 
  Oil&#8217;s board is diverse (White, Asian, Hispanic, African Americans). But 
  it is the vision for the future of Mr. Jay Bennett that certainly drives and 
  governs the strategy and the philosophy of Kingdom Oil.</p>
<p> Is this the Republican version of the Democrat way of causing us to lose focus 
  with respect to the issues of the day? Is the Democratic inner city trough being 
  replaced by a Republican inner city trough? <br>
  In terms of Election 2004, we are offering no position in terms of either Mr. 
  Kerry or Mr. Bush. We think they have both been a disaster in terms of communities 
  of color. But, like many, we hope for more detailed descriptions of what to 
  expect as we move toward Elections 2004 and beyond. </p>
<p> The faith based program is widespread throughout the Federal Government in 
  these seven agencies: Departments of Education, Labor, Housing &amp; Urban Development, 
  Agriculture, Health &amp;Human Services, Justice, and the U.S. Agency for International 
  Development. I offer, as a layman, the seven areas of concern in <strong>The 
  Minneapolis Story</strong>: education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing, and ethics. These seven areas, as covered in the book and in our 
  two solution papers on these seven issues at www.TheMinneapolisStory.com more 
  than provides what ought to be done. Why do the Democrats and the Republicans, 
  the NAACP and Urban League, Federal secular and Federal faith based, Black churches 
  and White churches, Star Tribune and Insight, continue to ignore these proposals? 
  Is it because they are community based and not based on having to be paid off 
  first? Is &#8220;faith-based&#8221; an attempt to turn the Democratic Black 
  Church into the Republican Black Church, with the same folks getting payoffs? 
  Democrats have used inner city programs to control Black votes. Are the Republicans 
  now attempting the same thing with their faith based management programs to 
  control the agendas and issues facing our inner city communities? Let both parties 
  compete for our votes in these seven areas.</p>
<p> The revitalization along with a sense of a new Black church serving Black 
  America, as discussed at this two and a half day retreat, is something that 
  appeals to all African-Americans as it pertains to the important role of the 
  Black church, through love and service, to give guidance and vision to the salvation 
  of Black America. </p>
