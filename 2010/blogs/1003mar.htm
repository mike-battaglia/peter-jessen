<p><strong><a name="1002b0318" id="0830b10"></a>3-18-10, #2:&nbsp; Alert: Is our lack of plans and their execution drawing us to a plan to execute in Mexico?</strong></p>
<p>Is the Minneapolis 2010 homicide total to date that averages one a week since the beginning of the year a precursor of larger battles in American border towns along the Rio Grande? Has former Mexican President Fox&rsquo;s comment that there is no border, that Mexico extends all the way to DesMoines being misunderstood by Mexican gang bangers as permission to cross our border and commit acts of violence with impunity? We have a reversal of Saddam Hussein who said that when there are 10,000 body bags on the Tarmac, the Americans would leave. Once we get a body count in some American town of 15-20 piled up after a murderous incident by Mexican gang bangers, the only question will be how many American troops will be sent to Mexico to fight drug traffickers as done in Panama and El Salvador. Will this be a response to the legacy of Che, who hoped to bring down the U.S. through sending drugs to American cities?&nbsp; How will this alter the battle of minorities for government funds? Will it result in more money &ldquo;lost&rdquo; from American inner city Black neighborhoods and sent to Hispanic border ones? What is the number of dead bodies on a single day that will be the tipping point to send in American troops? What plan will Minneapolis develop now for Minneapolis to deal with this kind of gang violence and drug trade, instead of making citizens suffer through the deaths necessary to reach our own tipping point? </p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
