<p><strong>These are interesting times, exciting times.</strong> They remind me of the famous 
  line on city tension at the beginning of Dickens&#8217; The Tale of Two Cities, when 
  he wrote &#8220;it was the best of times, it was the worst of times?&#8221; Are 
  you excited and happy or nervous and trembling as you contemplate all that is 
  going on today in Minneapolis? Are you happy, sad, scared? Fear not. Hope and 
  possibilities are here.</p>
<p>I have enclosed the book The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes for you because 
  I know that you will want to benefit from the insights and suggested proposals 
  of long time civil rights activist and leader, Ron Edwards that can lead away 
  from the worst of times and lead toward the best of times. As City Pages put 
  it 12-25-02, his book &#8220;connects the dots between his decades of activism 
  and the current state of the city.&#8221; The book is as relevant today as it 
  was last November, if not more so (I gave a copy to the Mayor last November, 
  at Lucile&#8217;s Kitchen, and should have done the same for you; I apologize and 
  am glad to make up for it at this time).</p>
<p>The book is witness to why many in Minneapolis give thanks to Ron Edwards for 
  his work in civil rights on their behalf for over 40 years. To recap: Ron was 
  Chairman of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission from 1979-1983 (Vice-Chairman, 
  1967-1972); President, Chairman of the Urban League (1978-1989), and served 
  on the Minneapolis branch NAACP Executive Committee, 1999-2002, as well as other 
  positions for the branch and the Minnesota-South Dakota NAACP. He has served 
  as the spokesman for the Black Police Officer&#8217;s Association in Minneapolis since 
  1996.</p>
<p>So our questions are simple: whither goest Minneapolis in race relations? Whither 
  goest Minneapolis Nice and the Golden Rule? For all in Minneapolis or just Whites 
  and a few selected minorities? As City Pages asks, how shall the &#8220;rancor 
  that has arisen between the Minneapolis Police Department and the city&#8217;s communities 
  of color&#8221; be dealt with? What ought to be? How? Ron answers these questions 
  in his book, which I am sending to all Minneapolis City Council Members and 
  re-sending to the Mayor. You can also listen to Ron reading from the book, on 
  6 tracks, on the web site, at www.TheMinneapolisStory.com &lt;https://theminneapolisstory.com&gt; 
  . The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, could just as easily have been called 
  the New York City Story or Newark Story or Detroit Story or St. Louis Story 
  or Cleveland Story or Kansas City Story or L.A. Story or San Francisco Story, 
  or Atlanta Story or Washington, D.C. Story, etc. In other words, although Ron 
  writes the story of Blacks in American cities today from the perspective of 
  Minneapolis, it is a perspective that fits any city. Does Minneapolis want to 
  continue to be a leader in keeping Blacks in their place or be a leader in integrating 
  them into the full life of the city? You and the Council decide.</p>
<p>Basketball fans say &#8220;Be like Mike.&#8221; For community leaders I suggest 
  &#8220;Be like Ron&#8221;: talk the walk and walk the talk. He proposes solutions 
  you can use to resolve the difficulties, which, again, could be used in any 
  city and would make a great platform for change if used by the Minneapolis City 
  Council. Ron has served, unpaid, as a tireless volunteer who works to meet the 
  challenges of the day in order to help all meet the community challenges of 
  the 21st century, Blacks and Whites, city, suburb and rural. He provides the 
  process and framework for doing so. What a great ally he is for all concerned 
  about civil rights, human rights and economic development across the board, 
  a man who for 40 years has promoted, in the words of the Preamble to our Constitution, 
  &#8220;a more perfect Union,&#8230;Justice,&#8230;domestic Tranquility,&#8230;general 
  Welfare, and&#8230;the blessings of Liberty&#8221; for every citizen, regardless 
  of race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, political orientation (liberal, 
  conservative, moderate, mixtures), and regardless of neighborhood (urban, suburban, 
  rural), etc. Ron&#8217;s story is a positive story of hope, patience and perseverance, 
  of the celebration of life in America, of an appreciation of a glass half full 
  that recognizes a lot of work yet to be done for the other half of the glass 
  that is still empty. He presents a vision of achievable, practical possibilities 
  for all. </p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s book is a beacon for the city if only the city will stand in its light. 
  Too many Black and White leaders have lost their sense of being leaders of diverse 
  groups and now too many want homogenous followers in terms of race, creed, gender, 
  sexual orientation, political orientation, neighborhood, etc. </p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s book demonstrates that he eloquently stands for what everyone else claims 
  to stand for but often fear or don&#8217;t know how to go about attempting, and that 
  is to achieve a diverse economy of living-wage jobs that includes locally based 
  independent businesses owned by both Blacks and Whites, all living in decent 
  housing while their kids get an excellent education. Ron&#8217;s Interlude 8, &#8220;Torn 
  from the Land,&#8221; shows how the land and wealth of Blacks were taken in this 
  country, whether by de jure or de facto Jim Crow laws, as well as by such extra-legal 
  means as the burning to the ground of whole towns (as in Greenwood, Oklahoma 
  in Interlude 13 on the Tulsa Race Riots, and Rosewood, Florida in Interlude 
  8). Offered prejudice and discrimination, segregation and bias, while being 
  denied equal access and denied equal opportunity, too many Blacks have been 
  purposefully left behind.</p>
<p>To briefly review Ron&#8217;s book: Ron writes in a compelling way about the PAST 
  (see his almost love sonnet to Minneapolis in Chapter 15, the 7 paragraphs beginning 
  on p. 262 with &#8220;Society needs visionaries.&#8221; He also writes about the 
  identifying characteristics of Minneapolis, positive and negative, that have 
  led us to where Minneapolis is today (Chapter 6), and he sets out his philosophy 
  (Chapter 4) as he singles out justice and fairness as it relates to equal access 
  and opportunity (Chapter 5). He unveils the truth about the PRESENT in his chapters 
  on the courts (Chapter 3), education (Chapter 7), housing (Chapter 8), jobs 
  (Chapter 9), the university (Chapter 10), city government (Chapter 11), redistricting 
  (Chapters 12-13), the local branches of the NAACP and the Urban League (Chapter 
  14), the set up to kick the Vikings out of town (Chapter 15), and about community-police 
  relations and mediation (Chapter 16). And now the table turns as Ron becomes 
  the visionary writing about the FUTURE in a most positive and challenging way 
  as he lays out the common ground all Minneapolis citizens and Minnesotans can 
  agree to, Black and White, male and female, urban and suburban and rural, with 
  his common YESes and common NOs, and other suggestions for taking today into 
  tomorrow (see Chapter 5, Interlude 16, Chapter 17, and the Conclusion), including 
  suggesting the establishment of a set of &#8220;Sullivan Principles for Minneapolis.&#8221; 
  [Chapter 14] </p>
<p>The book uses the term &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racist.&#8221; These terms 
  are not used to emotionally obscure fuzzy thinking about the causes of poverty, 
  inequality, different levels of school achievement, etc., about which there 
  is much debate (but, as Ron says Nellie Stone Johnson always used to tell him, &#8220;No education, no housing, no hope&#8221;). Ron uses the terms to build 
  on the Star Tribune&#8217;s 1991 series on racism in Minnesota (&#8221;Issues of Race&#8221;) 
  as he notes in Interlude 2. The terms refer to the prejudice, discrimination, 
  segregation, bigotry, and bias used to deny equal access and equal opportunity, 
  something Whites did not see [in 1991] as an issue but non-Whites did. However, 
  Ron is not unmindful of the progress that has been made, as he demonstrates 
  in Interludes, 5 and 7, which he calls &#8220;The Good News On Race, Parts I 
  and II.&#8221; He also recognizes that any glass that is half full is also half 
  empty, as in Interlude 10, which discusses the racism in Minneapolis as reported 
  in another 1991 cover story, this time the Mpls.St.Paul Magazine. Ron seeks 
  equal access and opportunity for all, whether inner city or in any ring of the 
  suburbs or rural. As noted above, Ron recognizes that &#8220;Society needs visionaries,&#8221; 
  be they organizations like the City Council, Chamber of Commerce, NAACP, the 
  Urban League, or individuals such as those he writes about in his book: George 
  Washington Carver, W.E.B. DuBois, Martin Luther King, Jr., Justice Thurgood 
  Marshall, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Nelly Stone 
  Johnson, A. Philip Randolph, Adam Clayton Powell, and others. Ron understands 
  the Minneapolis Story, its successes and pride as well as the historic wrongs 
  perpetrated against minorities in general and Blacks in particular that need 
  to be redressed and fixed. Some of the things The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes lists as needing to be redressed, for which Ron provides a process for 
  doing so, as taken from the book, include, among others:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The taking (shredding?) of the Ward 5 files by Jackie Cherryhomes, without 
    a demur from Mayor or Council, despite the protest and seeking of help about 
    it by her successor (Chapter 12)</li>
  <li>How the Hollman housing deal was to provide more affordable housing for 
    the poor, especially poor Blacks, but instead has become a way to (1) launder 
    money for down town projects (and if that word is too strong, how about misused, 
    misspent, misappropriated?), and (2) displaced them to make way for upscale 
    White gentrification, what Ron calls &#8220;razing Black homes to raise White 
    homes&#8221; (Chapter 8)</li>
  <li> The containment and disempowerment of Black poor, seen in the redistricting 
    plans (Chapters 12-13).</li>
  <li> The negative &#8220;identifying characteristics&#8221; of Minneapolis &#8220;Plantation 
    Bosses&#8221; (Chapter 5).</li>
  <li> The common YESes and NOs too often denied Blacks that need to be for all 
    (Chapter 5)</li>
  <li> The data on education achievement for Blacks that if they were data for 
    Whites would, as Kunjufu points out, be called a &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; 
    as the results of current policy is to provide poor schools that keep kids 
    poor and uncompetitive with suburban kids. When the National Assessment of 
    Education Progress reports that a 3rd of 4th graders are illiterate, they 
    don&#8217;t mean Whites, as the number is 63% for Black 4th graders, 58% for Hispanic 
    4th graders. As Ron says, this is not simply failure, it is mass fraud due 
    to the soft bigotry of low expectations (Chapter 7).</li>
  <li>The denial of jobs to Blacks, incarceration of Blacks, and the war on drugs 
    as a war on young Black men which, if these data applied to Whites, would 
    also be called a &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; if Whites too were offered 
    drugs and jail instead of jobs (Chapter 9).</li>
  <li>How the above causes some in the NAACP and Urban League to take steps opposed 
    to progress for Blacks, playing into the hands of the unintended consequence 
    of helping to maintain the status quo (Chapter 14)</li>
  <li>The attempt of the city to avoid mediation between community and police 
    and then once finally accepted to undermine the process (Chapter 16). * The 
    walking out on the Federal mediator by the Council to avoid a vote (Chapter 
    16).</li>
  <li> That despite a full chamber and overflow of concerned citizens eager for 
    mediation, the Council at first voted it down (Chapter 16). </li>
  <li> How unrest and disturbances are used as the acceptable price to maintain 
    the status quo (Chapter 16). </li>
  <li>What to do? Again, Ron summarizes all of his recommendations in Chapter 
    17.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key? Don&#8217;t label as &#8220;undermining&#8221; any attempts to modernize bad laws 
  nor label as &#8220;a retreat&#8221; from existing commitments any effort to try 
  new methods for achieving better results. He calls for an easy common denominator: 
  following the Golden Rule, what JFK tried in attempting get Whites in the early 
  60s to drop Jim Crow laws, whether de jure or defacto (see Chapter 5). Ron discusses 
  how a better future can be calculated in Interlude 16 and lays out the positive 
  future possibilities for envisioning a dream for all and sustainable for all, 
  using the common YESes and NOs (Chapters 5 and 17), and considering the &#8220;7 
  Values&#8221; of the Conclusion, all exercised under the civility and kind auspices 
  of the Golden Rule. In Chapter 17, Ron also offers remedies for the redistricting 
  problem. He also cites numerous sources where readers can go for further information 
  on the topics he writes about.</p>
<p>Ron also outlines a basic problem: neither liberals nor conservatives think 
  Blacks can make it on their own and thus need to be cared for by the State. 
  Thus, the liberal &#8220;Kerner Commission Report&#8221; [1968] stated that Blacks 
  aren&#8217;t like other immigrants and can&#8217;t make it on their own. The conservative &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221; [1998] stated Blacks don&#8217;t have high enough IQs to make 
  it on their own. Both are racism at its &#8220;best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ron gives a fair hearing to the issues of importance to both the minority and 
  majority communities in such a way that they can both deal with the issues together 
  rather than make them separate political party issues. He urges both to become 
  part of the solution rather than remain part of the problem. Ron has the encouragement 
  and the passion of the 1960s, which he combines with the mentoring process of 
  a community elder, as he provides a sense of purpose and course to pursue that 
  will benefit all.</p>
<p>What better weekend than this to ask Frederic Douglass&#8217; question of 1852: &#8220;What 
  to the Slave is the Fourth of July?&#8221; (quoted in Ron&#8217;s conclusion chapter) 
  Ron wants it to be the 4th for all. Don&#8217;t you too? You can continue to follow 
  Ron&#8217;s thoughts on his weekly column and his daily web log, both of which 
  appear on his web page, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. If you have any further questions or wish to use the book for discussion groups, 
  as some have suggested, or other uses, just let us at Beacon on the Hill Press 
  know how we can help.</p>
