<p><strong>Solution Paper #26</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE,</strong> <strong>4-4-05.</strong> I have asked my Publisher to 
  include his June 2000 <strong>&#8220;A Columbine P.S.&#8221;</strong> in our 
  &#8220;Solution Papers&#8221; section as a way to add to our ongoing presentations 
  of solutions to the problems of violence in our own city of Minneapolis and, 
  in particular, in our schools. This, then, is our sense of <strong>&#8220;A 
  Red Lake P.S.&#8221;</strong> We believe this is as relevant today for us and 
  for Red Lake as it was then for Columbine and as it is for every school in America. 
  We hope it will lead to preventative measures such that there will be no need 
  for <strong>&#8220;A Minneapolis P.S.&#8221;</strong> See also our web log entries 
  2005/#s 39 and 37. See also our columns 2005/#4 and #6. See also m book, <em>The 
  Minneaplis Story, Through My Eyes,</em> Chapters 7 (Education), #16 (The negative 
  status quo), #17 (The Positive Future Possibilites for Minneapolis).</p>
<p align="center"><strong>26: A Columbine P.S. <br>
  </strong><strong>By Peter Jessen <br>
  June 2000</strong> </p>
<p>The Columbine school shootings occurred April 20, 1999, three days after the 
  final draft of "The Terry Hitchcock Story" was completed. Like everyone else, 
  we were stunned. As we followed the story, we realized that we had missed a 
  significant application of the &#8220;marathons of life&#8221; theme. Yes, it applies to 
  any individual, and yes, it applies to the individual students who have to run 
  the K-12 marathon. But in reflecting upon Columbine and all of the work we have 
  done with corporations, from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, as well as 
  our teaching at colleges and universities, it dawned on us that the theme applies 
  to institutions as well. We write our &#8220;postscript&#8221; on the first anniversary 
  of Columbine. We cannot allow ourselves to remain stunned into inaction. We 
  have chosen to concentrate on education, as &#8220;Public-opinion poll after poll 
  indicates that Americans&#8217; No. 1 concern is education&#8221; (Newsweek, May 15, 2000). 
</p>
<p>A key question is whether or not there is a mechanism or model to follow which 
  might enable all of those in society who have a stake in education to work together 
  to create a dynamic resolution acceptable to all? The answer is, there is. Such 
  model will be explored throughout the rest of this essay. </p>
<p><strong>GENERAL PICTURE</strong> </p>
<p>Overall violence among school kids is going down. Yet &#8220;isolated incidents&#8221; 
  show how isolated we are not. Nine incidents the year before the Columbine tragedy, 
  with 15 killed and dozens wounded impacted on thousands more. With nearly that 
  many victims in one incident, at just one school, Columbine, it garnered far 
  more publicity. And then just over a year after Columbine, a first grade boy 
  shoots and kills a first grade girl with whom he had been arguing the day before. 
</p>
<p>The shooters at Columbine thought they could control life in death. Their fellow 
  students now have to find control of the meaning of their lives. In the wake 
  of these two shooters, countless thousands of schools have clamped down on all 
  students. More than two dozen students at Columbine are &#8220;classified as 
  homebound&#8217; for physical and psychological reasons&#8230;so they receive 
  their education at home.&#8221; Three are still in wheel chairs, while &#8220;many 
  continue to seek therapy and religious counseling." </p>
<p>It has affected students&#8217; studies and behavior, as &#8220;academically, 
  a lack of an ability to concentrate, and the unpredictability of the students 
  in the classroom,&#8221; where every two to three weeks &#8220;they&#8217;re 
  off the wall and extremely difficult to handle.&#8221; What does this all mean? 
  According to the Columbine principal, Frank DeAngelis, &#8220;It&#8217;s about 
  not giving up, and that&#8217;s what Columbine High School represents.&#8221; 
  Thus, he says, &#8220;It&#8217;s been a year of hills and valleys&#8230;we&#8217;re 
  learning to cope.&#8221; And yet &#8220;he, like his students, faculty, and 
  staff, is not about to give up (&#8221;Columbine: A Year of Tragedy and Triumph,&#8221; 
  Mindy Sink, Upfront, a scholastic magazine by The New York Times, April 10, 
  2000, pp. 8-10).</p>
<p> How do they survive the shootings? How do they grieve and then get on with 
  life? How do they, or any school with a shooting, deal with the pain and struggle, 
  and survive? How do they survive the marathon of a year&#8217;s after shocks of emotions? 
</p>
<p>In his book, <em>Man&#8217;s Search For Meaning</em> (called "one of the ten most 
  influential books in America" by a 1991 Library of Congress/Book-of-the-Month 
  Club survey), Victor Frankl describes what he learned from his four-year experience 
  in World War II German concentration camps. The survivors ran a daily marathon 
  we can only barely begin to comprehend. Frankl&#8217;s basic point is that when we 
  cannot enjoy life we must find meaning in our pain and suffering, and that, 
  in the final analysis, each person is free to exercise the last freedom: the 
  choice of attitude in responding to situations in life. Frankl&#8217;s book speaks 
  directly to the Columbine tragedy in particular and to what society might do 
  about it in general. Despite the horrors of life, he asserts, we can still find 
  meaning in our lives, survive, and prepare each generation for the future.</p>
<p>He asks us to be alert in a two-fold sense: Since Auschwitz we know what man 
  is capable of; and since Hiroshima we know what is at stake. Of all the highly 
  publicized school shootings, Columbine has captured the attention of society 
  far more than any other violent school tragedy has. As we look at the bodies 
  of dead students, we recognized that we too have to be alert in another two-fold 
  sense as well: Since Columbine we know what some students are capable of; and 
  since the responses to it, from all sides, we know what is at stake. </p>
<p><strong>A WAKE-UP CALL </strong></p>
<p>April 20, 1999 tells us that in addition to the Ides of March we have the Agonies 
  of April, as Columbine shares its infamous month in history with Martin Luther 
  King, Jr.&#8217;s assassination, the Kent State shootings, the last U.S. troops leaving 
  Vietnam, the Oklahoma City bombing, and a 1st grader shooting another 1st grader 
  a year after Columbine. Most of these had one thing in common: young people 
  involved in violence and tragic deaths. </p>
<p>21 students wounded. A dozen students and one teacher slaughtered by two fellow 
  students who then slaughtered themselves. So few, these two, yet they affected 
  so many: individuals, families, communities, states, nations, the world. How? 
  By squandering hopeful optimism, closing not only themselves off to the possibilities 
  of the future, but also the possibilities and dreams of their fellow students 
  and the dreams of their teacher. These two youth had so much to live for, yet 
  could not stand to live. These two youth had so much and yet enjoyed it so little. 
  These two students lived what many would call an enchanted life, yet, instead, 
  felt disenchanted. </p>
<p>Columbine exposes us to the need to find a better a way to deal with the modern 
  marathon of K-12 education, a marathon for kids, teachers, parents and society 
  as a whole. And although it may be only a small fraction that won&#8217;t run in the 
  marathon, their refusal to run, as evidenced by Columbine, can ruin the race 
  for a great many others. </p>
<p>Our Youth and Education have become like a Rubik&#8217;s Cube: a seemingly innocent 
  piece of color and brightness, yet being representative of intricate and many 
  combinations of moves. How to get all in alignment? Many try. Few succeed. And 
  yet, in life, as with the Rubik&#8217;s cube, any action taken sets off a set of reactions 
  or chain reactions, for each spin of the horizontal or vertical squares influences 
  all succeeding actions. So too with teenagers and education. How can we solve 
  the teenagers and education puzzle, a puzzle that begins before Kindergarten, 
  a puzzle, which is, but the first of a series of puzzles encountered in life 
  by all? </p>
<p><strong>SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&#8226; How can we better prepare our kids and their adults (parents and 
    teachers) to successfully run and complete this K-12 educational marathon? 
  </p>
  <p>&#8226; What will be the future of education, public and/or private, tax 
    payer and/or voucher supported, neighborhood school and/or school choice, 
    local and/or state funding, individual efforts and/or collaborative, whole 
    language and/or phonics, direct instruction and/or discovery learning, developmentally 
    appropriate practices and/or learning style customization? What is meant by 
    education and how are its institutions (from teachers colleges, to government 
    education departments, to school boards, to the schools themselves), to be 
    evaluated? </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; How do we deal with a traditional system of set, unchanging structures 
      in a world that is rapidly changing? </p>
    <p>&#8226; How do we deal with an education work force schooled before modern 
      communications, the Internet, and globalization? </p>
    <p>&#8226; How do we deal with teenagers in terms of rapid change in the midst 
      of timeless truths and values that have not changed? </p>
    <p>&#8226; How do we answer the perennial questions to which all seek a resolution: 
      How will we fund education? </p>
    <p>&#8226; What shall we teach? How should it be taught? </p>
    <p>&#8226; Finally, how do we answer the haunting question of whether or not 
      there can be &#8220;safe&#8221; schooling? And on a broader level, we can ask &#8220;From 
      Columbine to Where? What next?&#8221;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the schools, what is their mission in our society? What method 
  should they use to peacefully and happily coexist and serve with the rest of 
  society&#8217;s institutions? What means exist to resolve the conflicts and reduce 
  if not eliminate future Columbines? We believe that only the institutions of 
  education interacting with the other institutions of society can we, together, 
  adequately answer and resolve these questions and problems. This is why we propose 
  that educational, social, and business institutions engage in another marathon 
  of sorts-<strong>a conflict resolution, mission and development method </strong>marathon, 
  with the runners being all of the involved individuals and institutions, to 
  find, to use Justice Felix Frankfurter&#8217;s phrase, a &#8220;binding tie of cohesive 
  sentiment.&#8221; We call this for short, the "SCHOOL MISSION MARATHON." </p>
<p>We recommend these <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/confrescolum.html" target="_blank">18 
  conflict resolution models in general</a> </strong>and, in particular, of those, 
  the establishing in schools of a peer mediation program as one of several ways 
  to eliminate the sense of helplessness. We recommend school minimally consider 
  these<strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/pages/confrescolum.html" target="_blank"> 
  five models</a></strong> of the 18 referred to:</p>

  <li> 2 x 2 probability of outcome matrix of Mary Pipher </li>
  <li> Using &#8220;self-talk&#8221; and the CO2RE/LEAD formulas to raise Adversity Quotient

    Meichenbaum&#8217;s word, all that can be is &#8216;negotiable" </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EDUCATION AND SOCIAL MOBILITY </strong></p>
<p>K-12 education is a long, collective marathon in a manner in which post high 
  school education is not. This one 13-year marathon is broken down into three &#8220;shorter&#8221; ones: K-5 or 6 Elementary School, 6-8 Middle or 7-9 Junior High School, 
  and 9 or 10-12 High School. Not all finish. The very fact that one in four who 
  start high school do not finish should alert us to the phenomenon that increasingly, 
  students are suffering from a &#8220;learned helplessness&#8221; (Martin E.P. Seligman, 
  <em>Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life</em>, Pocket Books, 
  New York, 1990). </p>
<p>Others are forced to play on an uneven playing field of resources between school 
  districts that adequately fund, under fund, or are over funded. Historically, 
  people had ascribed status: status assigned them at birth, so that if they were 
  born into the upper or privileged class, they stayed there, and if they were 
  born into the poorer classes they stayed there as well. The modern child grows 
  up knowing that regardless of his or her station at birth, it is possible to 
  achieve one&#8217;s dreams if one learns how, which means, get a good education (although 
  studies show that the more affluent one&#8217;s parents the greater the chance of 
  acquiring a higher education). </p>
<p>Many self-improvement books continually repeat as almost a mantra: leaders 
  are readers, which is also the key to good writing. Skills in both are acquired 
  through the educational process. When General Douglas MacArthur was asked what 
  the most important skill of a soldier was he answered, &#8220;being able to write.&#8221; 
  Biographers note that General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#8217;s advancement came because 
  he was able to write clear reports from wherever in the world he was sent. Biographers 
  have likewise noted the sense that a key reason for promoting General Ulysses 
  S. Grant was his ability to write (and his commander in chief, Abraham Lincoln 
  is considered by his biographers the best writer to hold the office of President). 
  All of these individuals read. And what is the key skill needed in any profession? 
  The ability to present oneself in writing, in speaking, and in person. </p>
<p>Napoleon also insisted on clear writing. Outside his tent sat his Army&#8217;s idiot. 
  Any orders written for his Generals had to be shown to him first. If he didn&#8217;t 
  understand the orders they had to be re-written. General George Patton was not 
  like the tall, deep voiced actor George C. Scott who played him in the movie. 
  He was short, very slender, and had a high-pitched voice. But he was a reader. 
  He could write. And the depth of his education enabled him to lead as few others 
  have. </p>
<p>At the bottom of all of this is education, whether it is Abraham Lincoln learning 
  by reading by the fireplace or public schools being made available to everyone 
  or citizens with special views establishing private schools or generals being 
  sent to the elite school of West Point. Education was and is the key. The GI 
  Bill enabled thousands to get a college education after World War II, just as 
  the great need opened up.</p>
<p> An even greater need exists for the 21st Century to have students educated 
  in the technological, and the academic, in order to meet society&#8217;s needs for 
  21st Century workers for the Information/ Internet/Bio-tech century. Regardless 
  of what one thinks of public education as an institution, education as a process 
  is central to survival in the 21st century, both professionally and personally. 
  It is also the key to social mobility in modern society. </p>
<p><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF DISENCHANTMENT & PROMISE OF ENCHANTMENT </strong></p>
<p>The classical sociologist Max Weber coined the term <strong>&#8220;The Iron Cage,&#8221; 
  his name for the routinized existence of modern times,</strong> a condition 
  of necessity to deal in an orderly way with huge numbers of people and complicated 
  technological equipment (see The Iron Cage, by Arthur Mitzman, Grosset & Dunlap, 
  New York, 1969)). He lamented the loss of enchantment in the world, and called 
  for a re-enchantment of the modern world. Before modern times, most enchantment 
  came through religion. </p>
<p>The schools, working on an almost totally secularized basis have taken away 
  this avenue of enchantment from not only their students but themselves. Lack 
  of funding has shut down many of the secular forms of enchantment, such as drama, 
  music, physical education, and other electives. </p>
<p>The terrible and tragic consequence of not having activities that enchant, 
  such as a wide range of electives, art, PE, etc., is that too often, in their 
  search for enchantment, students seek enchantment in chemicals, violence fantasies, 
  guns, or other forms of unacceptable behavior. </p>
<p>The arts, including music and drama. P.E. and all the rest, are needed not 
  only to help give students a complete education, but also to enable them to 
  mentally and emotionally attack the core academic courses refreshed, with a 
  sense of knowing that after all of the hard work of repetitive studies, they 
  have a place to go to re-enchant themselves and be happy to be there. </p>
<p>As parents, we have heard students and parents and teachers talk about how 
  if it weren&#8217;t for electives, some students would not stay in school. </p>
<p>Indeed, we have two types of students. Those who come for the academics and 
  discover the joys of the electives, and those who come only for the electives 
  and, in the process, are guided toward learning academic basics as well. </p>
<p>In another recent article in <em>The Oregonian</em>, we read that many students 
  have said, &#8220;The bonds that art and music can create within a school are 
  special, perhaps unique,&#8221; that, as stated about one school, &#8220;choirs 
  bring pride and &#8216;esprit de corps&#8217; to a school that doesn&#8217;t 
  always triumph on the grid iron&#8230;" Thus, there are those for whom it is 
  choir (or other art or music) that &#8220;helps keep them on board.&#8221; And 
  yet schools are often reducing or cutting them out completely (with some elementary 
  school even cutting out recess). </p>
<p>One could conclude that eliminating electives and extracurricular activities 
  undermines the very academic goal sought in the new requirements. Conversely, 
  keeping them helps the schools&#8217; efforts to achieve learning by the students 
  in a peaceful/orderly manner. </p>
<p>&#8220;The times they are a changin&#8217;.&#8221; Generation Y has been identified as those 
  between the ages of 13 and 19. They equal, in number, the baby boomers. It took 
  15 years to produce the baby boomers. It has taken only 6 to produce generation 
  Y. Things are going to get very interesting, very complicated, and very messy. 
  This is why we urge developing a joint &#8220;School Mission Marathon&#8221; process to 
  address these issues. </p>
<p>The boredom of the routine needs to be relieved. Electives relieve. Most adults 
  get training time, conferences, etc., all things away from their routine, hence, 
  by any definition, enchanting. We could extend our discussion by urging that 
  we have motivational and uplift assemblies for our kids, not fewer assemblies. 
  Bottom line: alcohol, tobacco, other illegal drugs, undesired behavior, etc., 
  become defacto enchantment without other choices and electives. </p>
<p>Finally, how do we deal with the disenchantment of seemingly tolerated school 
  teasing or hazing that some feel is part of the growing up process and not to 
  be stopped? How do we deal with the statements of the fellow students of the 
  Columbine killers (&#8221;It Still Hurts: For Columbine Students, The Struggle 
  isn&#8217;t Over,&#8221; Mindy Mink, Upfront, [a scholastic magazine provided 
  for classrooms by The New York Times]. April 10, 2000, pp. 11-15) who admit, 
  &#8220;When we were freshmen, the senior class used to be able to get away with 
  a lot of stuff&#8230;picking on kids. Just pushing them around, teasing them. 
  They did get teased. They did get persecuted a lot.&#8221; Now those activities 
  get students expelled. &#8220;Fight or flight&#8221; still overrides &#8220;flow&#8221; 
  for many kids. Just feeling insecure and afraid that one is going to be teased, 
  let alone physically bothered, shuts down the cerebral cortex and prevents learning. 
  This is why, empirically, biologically, brain wise, it is important that school 
  all be a "PEACE ZONE". </p>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY AND THE PEACE ZONE </strong></p>
<p>Kids today are Internet and computer savvy where their parents are not, who 
  in turn were TV savvy but their parents were not, who in their turn were radio 
  savvy whose parents were not. Before that, change was slow. Now it is rapid. 
  The Internet has the technology to harness entertainment and education (sometimes 
  combined as &#8220;edutainment&#8221;). </p>
<p>This information cracking plant for the future will feature hands-on and distant 
  learning in a new kind of schoolhouse, which will still, virtually, serve the 
  old school houses as they transition to the new kind of information schoolhouse 
  for the 21st century. Where does the "PEACE ZONE" reside? This is why a communty 
  wide "family meeting" of all the "stakeholders" to dialogue to generate the 
  responses needed to answer that question. </p>
<p>It is like turning the fable of the tortoise and the hare on its head. It is 
  not so much competition as it is complementary collaboration and cooperation. 
  The Internet is the hare. The school building is the tortoise. We believe the 
  key is to blend the speed of the information economy and the fast moving nature 
  of high tech discoveries/inventions and development with the slower moving nature 
  of the bricks and mortars of schools, in order to keep up with fast paced change 
  with minimal disruption and maximum cost effectiveness. </p>
<p>The hare is unstable but fast. The tortoise is too stable and can hardly move. 
  Together, they compliment each other; one brings stability, the other the dynamic 
  of rapid changes in both technology and content. </p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of considerations and questions for schools and their 
  communities and families to develop together: </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&#8226; How do we compare ourselves to the past, when, for example, according 
    to a NPR radio program, in 1997 Los Angeles experienced only 33 homicides 
    per 100,000 people, whereas in 1855, in the same city, the number was whopping 
    414 per 100,000 people? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we bring closure to the issue? Media headlines insist that 
    although Columbine is forever changed by rampage, no closure exists, and that 
    despite the tragedy a year later, rational debate about violence remains as 
    unresolved as ever. </p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we deal with what students say, as reported by them to state 
    attorney generals that violence is mostly influenced by their homes? o How 
    do we deal with the situation that &#8220;with the prevalence of single parents, 
    two-career families and 60 hour workweeks, much of the &#8216;raising&#8217;&#8221; of children 
    is done outside the home? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we answer the comment by the Kabit-Zinns, in their book Everyday 
    Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting, when they say that today&#8217;s 
    problems &#8220;are staggering and all-pervasive, and are creating a society in 
    which it is increasingly difficult for families to raise healthy children&#8221;? 
  </p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we factor in the reality that many have thrown in the towel 
    with kids, that, as Molly Ivins reported that Public Agenda, a public policy 
    research group, in a 1997 poll, discovered that &#8220;we don&#8217;t like our own children&#8221; 
    and: &#8220;80% of us think it is uncommon to find parents who are good role models 
    for their children&#8221;? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How does this square with the constant comment of many that either 
    the schools should provide parenting or who accuse the schools of producing 
    behavior in students, which was actually produced at home? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How is the overall educational system to be dealt with when there 
    are so many conflicting &#8220;solutions&#8221; proposed: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; Do nothing; o Lock schools down with metal detectors, locked doors, 
      armed guards; </p>
    <p>&#8226; Profile every student regarding risk potential and either counseling 
      them or putting them in special schools; </p>
    <p>&#8226; Increase self-esteem training; </p>
    <p>&#8226; Re-evaluate and restructure education, either within the system 
      or outside the system (independent charter schools, vouchers, for-profit 
      education alternatives, etc.); or </p>
    <p>&#8226; Focus on the teachers unions, to either eliminate them or increase 
      their authority and responsibilities.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; How do we reconcile those who do or don&#8217;t believe in our country 
    (a split that developed in the 60&#8217;s)? How do we begin to find a middle ground 
    on which all can stand, for the sake of the kids of America? .</p>
  <p>&#8226; What should be done about the fact that 800,000 times last year some 
    student took a gun to school? More education? More incarceration? Or is there 
    another solution? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How was it possible for kids to take guns to school in the 50s, and 
    still have them in college dorm rooms in the 60s, without incident, and not 
    allowed them today for fear of incidents? What does this say about our growing 
    relativism and tolerance of all cultures, and does our refusal to judge those 
    who harm others and do not up hold human rights cause our school kids to follow 
    suit with Columbines? .</p>
  <p>&#8226; How can the enormous regulatory burden of the Federal Departent of 
    Ecation be reduced, a burden which can account for 6% of a school budget just 
    to kep up to dte with the paper work? Why do teachers need so much curriculum 
    support? Would it be better for high schools to get rid of curriculum empires 
    and replace classroom teaches with Ph.D.s in their field? .</p>
  <p>&#8226; In a world where more and more are turnng to English s the ligua 
    franca, should we not change bilingual education from a de facto permanent 
    end and make it the means, instead, to a program of transition to a common 
    language for all? .</p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we deal with Ellen Goodman&#8217;s question of how to deal with 
    post-Dr. Seuss books like "honey Bunny, Funnybunny," used in pre-school training 
    in which the message is that nay kind of attention is good, even if it is 
    the torment of teasing? Could this not sow the seeds of helplessness that 
    lead to Columbines and other destructive behaviors? .</p>
  <p>&#8226; How do we deal with research over 20 years showing that &#8220;large 
    schools.don&#8217;t work for many children, or at least don&#8217;t allow 
    them to reach their full potential,&#8221; so that we should build &#8220;more 
    small schools, not fewer large ones, and&#8230;turn large schools into smaller 
    ones"? </p>
  <p>&#8226; How shall Jeff Greenfield&#8217;s comment and question to the Democratic 
    presidential candidates&#8217; debate at the Apollo Theater on February 21, 
    2000 be factored, as he asked: "in light of the different proposals, from 
    revolutionary improvement to gradual improvement to public choice and private 
    alternatives, how do you respond to this question: if, after 35 years and 
    $100 billion in Title I money, with SAT scores gap not narrowing, why not 
    conclude that the opposition to choice is an example of the support of special 
    interests and not the interests of students? How do you defend and account 
    for this incredible potential unfulfilled?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8226; How shall those involved come to realize and act on the truth of 
    one of the central tenants of W. Edwards Deming, which is that the problem 
    is not people but the system in which they have to work. Change the system 
    and you will solve the problems. In this light, Mary Walton&#8217;s <em>The Deming 
    Management Method</em> is recommend. This is echoed by the best selling business 
    author Ken Blanchard, who says that &#8220;People are not the problem,&#8221; as &#8220;most 
    performance problems are not the fault of people, but of systems.&#8221; What does 
    this say about how serious we ought to be at looking at the working of the &#8220;system&#8221; of education? This is also echoed by Robert Watts, as seen in the 
    title of his book, <em>People Are Never the Problem; People Have Problems</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>&#8226; How can business help? What role should business play? </p>
  <p>&#8226; There are those who don&#8217;t see how business can be a part of the discussion. 
    Those still of that mind are urged to read the article by Bernard Avishai, 
    <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/policy/97407/page1.html" target="_blank">&#8221;What 
    Does Business Owe Society?&#8221;</a> Avishai demonstrates that all of us are stakeholders. 
    Avishai, a retired CEO, calls for business and corporations to step up to 
    the plate in this game we call education. His article answers his title question, &#8220;What Does Business Owe Society?&#8221; (4th qt. 1997 issue of Booz Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Strategy 
    & Business&#8221;). His article speaks directly to our shared concerns. A favorite 
    line in Avishai&#8217;s article is this, as it addresses most of our concerns succinctly: 
    &#8220;Is it possible that what most conventional educators mean by the evaporation 
    of their students&#8217; self-discipline is that, given the experience of television, 
    students no longer have the capacity to be bored to death? (p. 7)&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&#8226;<strong> More points by Bernard Avishai: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; &#8220;25% of the current American work force is not sufficiently educated 
      to be qualified for jobs that would pay enough to sustain the middle-class 
      life&#8221; p. 4 </p>
    <p>&#8226; &#8220;this means that 10 or 20 or 30 million people&#8212;people with children, 
      people hobbled by dullness and self-doubt, people who played by rules that 
      simply evaporated from the time they were 15 to the time they were 35&#8212;are hard pressed to see a future.&#8221; p. 4 </p>
    <p>&#8226; &#8220;companies contribute to democratic solutions by remaining capable 
      of creating the wealth shareholders and governments appropriate, not by 
      taking on the responsibility of governments.&#8221; p. 5 </p>
    <p>&#8226; Taxes for education should be seen as a &#8220;necessary investment pool, 
      not a redistributive levy on profits&#8221;, that they should not be seen as some 
      anti-business tax, as companies can&#8217;t teach the basics, seeing public schools 
      as being more like &#8220;specialized graduate schools than elementary schools.&#8221; 
      p. 6 </p>
    <p>&#8226; Part of what companies can do: &#8220;develop teaching materials&#8212;theoretical 
      articles, multimedia software, instructional films, on-line simulations 
      and so forth&#8212;that reflect their peculiar competitive experiences and 
      advantages. There is no reason why companies cannot market these products 
      to school boards and universities, to new entrepreneurial teaching enterprises 
      and to families.&#8221; p. 7 </p>
    <p>&#8226; About his prescriptions, Avishai says &#8220;I wish I could say that 
      I expect other business leaders to adopt these attitudes before things get 
      much worse. But I can tell you that many more will adopt them as things 
      get worse.&#8221; p. 8 </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&#8226; In looking at the debates regarding religion in the school, how does 
    Peter Berger&#8217;s notion that Americans are as religious as the people of India, 
    whereas much of education is presided over by an elite as secular as Sweden&#8217;s? 
  </p>
  <p>&#8226; Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona&#8217;s superintendent of Public Instruction: &#8220;Everyone is complicit in trying to make the education system look good without 
    merit.&#8221; &#8220;This country is so content not to know the truth about its children, 
    its horrifying.&#8221; [Arizona: the self-proclaimed &#8220;chicks in charge state,&#8221; where 
    the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney General and president 
    of the State Senate are all women] </p>
  <p>&#8226; Now that Internet access is almost universal (homes, schools, libraries, 
    community centers), combined with much cheaper computers and electronic &#8220;appliances,&#8221; 
    how do we structure the use of existing facilities such that the so-called &#8220;digital divide&#8221; is narrowed, not widened? </p>
  <p>&#8226; <strong>More Questions: </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; How do we deal with the statistics of 1 in 4 High School freshman 
      not completing their high school degrees, and two in three college freshmen? 
      Are they like the teens in &#8220;Riding the Rails: Teenagers on the Move During 
      the Great Depression&#8221;?Are our current drop outs merely a new version of 
      these boxcar boys and girls and the desperation that drove them away from 
      home? But then why now in an age of affluence? .</p>
    <p>&#8226; How do we get kids to feel proud about and determined to contribute 
      to what Georgie Anne Geyer calls &#8220;the real legacy of the 20th century,&#8221; 
      which is the &#8220;many freedoms&#8221; we have, and to understand that the U.S. has 
      spent the &#8220;American Century spreading liberty&#8221;, so as to bring the schools 
      on board what Peter Berger calls carrying an agenda of &#8220;The Culture of Liberty&#8221;? 
    </p>
    <p>&#8226; How do we deal with the August 30, 1999 Business Week article entitled &#8220;Kids were right all along: High school is obsolete,&#8221; advocating ending 
      it at 10th grade? (p. 146) .</p>
    <p>&#8226; Who will usher in a school mission marathon? And if the reader 
      participates, which of the six blind men examining the elephant does he 
      or she represent? Can we not regain our sight, and see not only the parts 
      but the whole, and in doing so, have a win-win for all? </p>

<p>We believe that educational, social, business, and government institutions 
  must collaborate as stake holders in a "School Mission Marathon" to dynamically 
  address the problems and needs facing our children and their education. For 
  all our sakes, we must find some common ground upon which to reconcile some 
  of the more horrifying realities with hope for the future. </p>
