<hr>
<p><strong>At the Super Bowl 2005,</strong> Commissioner Paul Tagliabue admitted 
  that the NFL had not done enough in terms of hiring Black executives. He promised 
  to move forward. We know that the NFL wants to do the right thing: not deny 
  a qualified bidder, not deny the property rights of Red McCombs. </p>
<p>
  The Strib issued a <strong><a href="http://startribune.com/stories/1519/5252797.html" target="_blank">&#8220;what 
  Reggie needs to know about the Vikings&#8221;</a></strong> piece. So we wish 
  to respond in kind and issue this &#8220;What the NFL and the NFL owners need 
  to know about Minnesota.&#8221;</p>
<p>
  We know Reggie Fowler Is qualified to own the Vikings. We also know of the obstacles 
  being tossed into his path by Minnesotans, especially those of the Twin City 
  variety, obstacles due to his color, hiding behind false statements and innuendoes 
  regarding his finances, qualifications, and stadium building abilities.</p>
<p>
  As discussed below, there is a new elephant in the Minnesota living room: Red 
  McComb&#8217;s acceptance of Reggie Fowler&#8217;s bid for the Vikings. Minnesota 
  wants to get ride of this new elephant. It prefers its rhinoceros in its Minnesota 
  living room: the rhinoceros of racism. We have dealt with this before on our 
  2002 web page, <a href="http://www.citizensforfairnessandjustice.com" target="_blank">Citizens 
  for Fairness and Justice</a>. And we have dealt with it in our book <em>The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>. Chapter 15 dealt with the preference 
  of Minnesota to kick the Vikings out of town, a thesis that is also in the book 
  by Strib reporter Jay Weiner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0816634343/qid=1109568458/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4824662-8252627?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Stadium 
  Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and bush League Boondoggles.</a> We have 
  also developed a &#8220;roll call&#8221; of those trying to get rid of the team 
  or threatening to. </p>
<p>
  Red and Reggie are on the right track. Numerous owners have stated the deal 
  is good. But Minnesotans are trying to sabotage it. We write in defense of the 
  bid, not because Reggie is Black but because he is qualified, and that despite 
  his being qualified, he is being sabotaged just because he is Black. Certain 
  Minnesotans are trying to discredit his qualifications because they don&#8217;t 
  want a Black owner EVEN THOUGH FOR THREE YEARS they have had a chance to make 
  an acceptable bid and have not. Now that a Black has made a bid they are rushing 
  to anoint Glen Taylor instead. This piece, then, is about what the NFL needs 
  to know about Minnesota.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let&#8217;s Review</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Spring 2002: Red McCombs</strong> of San Antonio, Texas, Spring 2002, 
  put his NFL football team, The Minnesota Vikings, up for sale. For nearly three 
  years no one was willing to meet his <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/sport/2004/09/01/04nfland.html" target="_blank">fair 
  market price.<br>
  </a><br>
  <strong>February 2005: Reggie Fowler</strong> of Phoenix, Arizona bid the fair 
  market price Red wanted, proved to Red that he and his partners could complete 
  the sale, and had his bid accepted by Red. <br>
  Reggie Fowler becomes the first Black owner of an NFL team. And therein lies 
  the rub.</p>
<p>
  And even though USA Today printed a story declaring that<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank"> 
  &#8220;League owners optimistic Vikings sale will go through,</a> we are seeing 
  evidence that there are those behind the scenes who are hiding behind contrived 
  technicalities to make sure that the NFL and the Vikings ownership remains <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/507/5212396.html" target="_blank">Whites 
  only: Blacks need not apply.</a> In other words, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">Glen 
  campaigned against Reggie, with Sid Hartman serving as Glen&#8217;s mouthpiece</a>. 
  The major &#8220;carrot&#8221; held out to the NFL is a bribe: deny Reggie, 
  accept Glen, and Glen will get the league a new stadium. This is a contemptible 
  straw man: the new stadium will be built, but in Minnesota&#8217;s time frame. 
  No one but Reggie has declared a willingness to abide by that time frame (NLT 
  2011) except Reggie IF he is unable to get movement before that (now in order 
  to effect a new stadium opening to dove tail with the St. Cloud corrido: 2008).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bottom line, </strong>with media based evidence listed below and from 
  40 years of community activist work and experience such that &#8220;we have 
  practically seen it all,&#8221; it is our contention that Reggie Fowler can 
  make the application because he is qualified to be the Vikings owner, as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>He meets the <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5239946.html" target="_blank">financial 
    strength</a></strong> required by the NFL</li>
  <li>One of his <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5238724.html">partners</a> 
    </strong>has professional (NBA) team ownership experience</li>
  <li>Two of his closest aides, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5240948.html" target="_blank">Kevin 
    Warren</a> and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5250622.html" target="_blank">John 
    Misler</a>, are old NFL hands as former players or executives in the NFL</li>
  <li>He is <strong><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">an 
    experienced businessman who knows how to put a deal together,</a></strong> 
    having begun businesses in packaging, aviation, construction, broadcasting, 
    banking, real estate and a Disney theme park, and his Spiral, Inc. is ranked 
    11th among the top 100 black businesses specializing in industrial/services 
    in 2004, according to <a href="http://www.blackenterprise.com/BE100sItem.asp?Id=is20041011&txtSearchFor=Spiral%2BInc%2E&MaxResults=0&YearBegin=0&YearEnd=7&onLineInfo=Yes" target="_blank">Black 
    Enterprise magazine</a>, and as also reported <strong> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank">in 
    USA Today;</a></strong> thus he&#8217;ll be able to put this one together</li>
  <li>He has a process for solving the stadium question</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Four sets of &#8220;signals&#8221; give us pause:</strong> </p>
<ol>
  <li>The Glen campaign signals</li>
  <li> The Strib discredit campaign signals</li>
  <li>T he Randy trade signals</li>
  <li>T he Winter Park leak signals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Glen Signal</strong> is first seen in two articles even before 
  the press conference announcing the deal is held, one by Reusse and the other 
  by Weiner, on the 13th, as <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236647.html" target="_blank">Glen 
  foretells the future as he sees it: </a></strong>Red will accept Reggie&#8217;s 
  bid to put a floor under his price; Reggie will fail; and Glen will pick up 
  the Vikings ball, and, as he is the only one who do so, will can get a stadium 
  out of the legislature (but if they don&#8217;t give him a tax subsidized stadium 
  Glen said he would move the team, so the only hope the NFL and the state have 
  to keep the team, according to Glen, is through a deal with the legislature 
  that Glen&#8217;s past experience in that body ensures). And in case anyone 
  misses this point, in the Weiner article, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.htm" target="_blank">Glen 
  made it clear he is has accepted his anointed</a></strong> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.htm">one 
  to buy the team</a><strong>,</strong> or, as would put it, as the Great 
  White Hope saving the locals, saving Red, and saving the NFL from the Black 
  buyer. And how does the &#8220;official&#8221; sports voice of Minnesota put it, 
  the day after the announcement of Reggie buying the team? He sets the stage 
  for the later resume flap by flat out sayng in his headline that<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936-2.html" target="_blank"> 
  Franchise could be moved,</a> which sets up his later pieces saying 
  that only Glen can be a stadium out of the legislatuare, which is his signal 
  to to the NFL to turn Reggie down so Glen can have the team and get them a stadium. 
  It is also a thinly veiled statement not to believe anything Reggie says.</p>
<p>
  The Strib signals came before and after the press conference in which Red said 
  he accepted Reggie&#8217;s bid. The Strib really piled it on, publishing numerous 
  innuendoes, making the flat out statement before hand that <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Clancy 
  didn&#8217;t buy the Vikings, and neither will Fowler.&#8221;</a></strong></p>
<p>
  The Strib has constantly declared in numerous articles that Reggie doesn&#8217;t 
  have the money, following Glen&#8217;s statement that Reggie didn&#8217;t have 
  the money, and says <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">&#8220;There 
  isn&#8217;t any doubt that the league will do all it can to make sure Taylor owns 
  the team, if there is going to be a change in ownership.&#8221;</a></strong> 
  Indeed, Weiner admits, the day after Red announced he accepted Reggie&#8217;s 
  bid, that &#8220;during a round of media interviews last week,&#8221; Glen &#8220;aggressively 
  questioned Fowler&#8217;s ability to gain approval from the NFL because he wanted 
  to give McCombs time to respond before going public.&#8221; In other words, 
  he was trying to sabotage Reggie&#8217;s deal and at the same time sabotage 
  Red by trying to force him to take his offer which Red has already told him 
  numerous times that he would not accept. With friends like Glen, you certainly 
  don&#8217;t need enemies.</p>
<p>
  The NFL needs to stand up to that damning statement of the Strib. The Strib 
  is signaling to the NFL that it is &#8220;OK&#8221; to deny Reggie as Glen will 
  pick up the ball and all will be well. And for those who maybe didn&#8217;t 
  get it, they published a condescending editorial called &#8220;<a href="http://startribune.com/stories/1519/5252797.html" target="_blank">A 
  few things Fowler needs to know,</a> in which the Strib hides behind 
  the anonymity of being an &#8220;editorial,&#8221; offering all that it hates 
  about the Vikings going back to 1970. And who are most of the villains of their 
  piece? Black men, singling out a Black player, Brent McClanahan, and a Black 
  Coach, Dennis Green, as if all that is wrong with the team is summed under the 
  color Black. The inference is clear: steer clear of trouble by steering clear 
  of this Black owner. How contemptible. The low regard in which the team is held 
  by the Strib is seen in the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5247482.html" target="_blank">Nick 
  Coleman negative piece</a> that manages to attempt to discredit not 
  only Reggie, but the Vikings, Red, and Dennis Green.</p>
<p>
  What shocks about the Strib that they have allowed their hatred and bigotry 
  to dump all over the Minnesota Vikings fan as if they are dumb and stupid. What 
  a love hate relationship the Strib has, calling the team &#8220;an irreplaceable 
  asset to the region&#8221; and yet calling it a team that people want to love 
  but really don&#8217;t, and then bolster&#8217;s Glen&#8217;s stadium claim 
  by saying Minnesotans are against public monies for a stadium but constantly 
  providing space for the notion that only Glen Taylor can get a tax payer subsidized 
  stadium out of the legislature. The Strib also provided a gratuitous advice 
  on PR to Fowler that goes beyond advice: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/357/5243089.html" target="_blank">it 
  attempts to discredit Fowler</a>. Through all of these it is almost 
  as if is preparing the way for the eventual announcement that Fowler has been 
  denied and they can say I told you so. The Strib even tries to discredit Reggie 
  in their piece that would seem, from the title, to be positive, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5250622.html" target="_blank">Fowler 
  proves he can tackle big challenges. </a>When Reggie&#8217;s PR firm 
  put out a company bio without checking with him (company bios are different 
  from job hunting bios) the Strib released a hurricane of articles about it using 
  them to &#8220;prove&#8221; that Reggie is not qualified. They tried to make 
  it a Notre Dame moment, as if this was an &#8220;O&#8217;Leary Affair.&#8221; But it clearly was 
  not. Was it bad PR? Most certainly: when they can&#8217;t &#8220;get you&#8221; on the big issues 
  that count they go after you on the little ones that are irrelevant. Does it 
  discredit Reggie? Most certainly not. But it is used to &#8220;justify&#8221; questioning 
  everything and tar him with a very broad brush suggesting questions where none 
  really exist. It gives those who want to the <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5247482.html" target="_blank">excuse 
  to say &#8220;This kind of thing casts doubt on everythingb about him and everything 
  he says from now on.</a></strong>&#8221; That&#8217;s about as broad a brush as you can 
  use. And please note: it kept O&#8217;Leary out of Notre Dame, but most assume something 
  else was involved. Note it had absolutely no impact in terms of his joining 
  the staff of the Vikings. Does it teach Reggie a lesson about Minneapolis media? 
  How could it not?</p>
<p>
  <strong>The Randy signal</strong> came in the form of the Strib article of 2-17-05 
  reporting <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5251651.html" target="_blank">Reggie 
  saying he would not trade Randy Moss,</a><br>
  only to be followed up six Strib articles on February 24 by the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5256783.html" target="_blank">Vikings 
  announcing a trade of Randy to Oakland</a> (see also <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5257573.html" target="_blank">here</a>, 
  <strong> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5257551.html" target="_blank">here</a></strong>, 
  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5256817.html" target="_blank"> 
  here</a>, and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5257590.html" target="_blank">here</a>). 
  This is way too much detailed information in so short a time: they were obviously 
  working on this, meaning that the old &#8220;leak machine&#8221; from inside 
  Winter Park to the Strib is alive and well. And even though it is Red&#8217;s 
  machine, and even if it is acting in &#8220;rogue&#8221; fashion, it ultimately 
  required his decision, which raises the interesting question in the Collins 
  bylined article, &#8220;Who the heck signed off on this?&#8221; No one is taking 
  credit. And Fowler remains quiet. In the Scoggins and Zulgad piece the Packers 
  take this as a great gift to them. Surely Viking executives facing a new owner 
  would not go against what they read he wanted. This suggests that a behind the 
  scenes &#8220;deal&#8221; has been concluded that will enable them to deny Reggie 
  what is now legally and rightfully his.</p>
<p>
  This episode (actually a continuation of others) also suggests that no matter 
  who the new owner is, they may well have to fire many of the old &#8220;veterans.&#8221; 
  If the Strib stories are true, Winter Park employees can&#8217;t be trusted 
  with company information. They knew Glen kept getting turned down. They knew 
  Reggie was working on a bid that was designed to meet Red&#8217;s price, and 
  yet they continued to provide &#8220;inside information&#8221; to Glenn and 
  his people. As Weiner reported February 11, 2005, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5234939.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Taylor 
  said that employees of the Vikings who had been working with him in sharing 
  financial information told him they could no longer &#8216;helps us because 
  they&#8217;re working with the other group,&#8217; Taylor said.&#8221;</a></strong> 
  The Winter Park crowd obviously got cold feet as they learned Red was going 
  to accept Reggie&#8217;s bid. The question now is, who&#8217;s side will be they on 
  with the new owner? This all adds up to why we say the finances are easy but 
  the color is hard. </p>
<p><strong>Red has one of the smartest financial men in Gary Woods</strong>. Red 
  is shrewd businessman (San Antonio Express-News, August 5, 2002, p. 1A; requires 
  registration and payment to see article, entitled &#8220;Is stadium McCombs&#8217; 
  goal?&#8221;) who has owned professional teams before. Red and Gary wouldn&#8217;t 
  make a deal if they didn&#8217;t think it could be done. Reggie is a fellow 
  businessman and millionaire. His millionaire partners would not have joined 
  him if they didn&#8217;t think it could be done. Red and Gary and Reggie&#8217;s 
  partners are not in the business of making themselves look either stupid or 
  foolish. But there are those who would do so (try to make them look silly and 
  stupid) to block the sale. So &#8220;whither goest thou, NFL?&#8221; Like everyone 
  else, we&#8217;ll stay tuned to see what flag they run up the flagpole: the 
  NFL claims they will display the U.S. flag. Minnesota wants them to display 
  the &#8220;Blacks need not apply&#8221; flag. What the Minneapolis anti-Reggie 
  group is left with is &#8220;the stadium defense&#8221; for denying Fowler: 
  only Glen can get the money out of the legislature, which is stuff and nonsense. 
</p>
<p> <strong>Our clear response: Reggie has made the deal</strong>. Turn the keys 
  over to him. He meets the financial requirements. <strong>&#8220;Overcome&#8221; 
  </strong>and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1890434523/qid=1109640837/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4824662-8252627?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">&#8220;overcoming&#8221;</a> 
  </strong>(as in &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221;) are words that again come into 
  play. <strong>Reggie must overcome</strong> those trying to block him from owning 
  the team. <strong>Red must overcome </strong>those who would try to control 
  what he does with his private property. <strong>The NFL must overcome</strong> 
  &#8220;Minnesota ice&#8221; and play by the &#8220;fairness and justice rules.&#8221; 
  As we do with any racist blocks we see thrown at any Black American in Minneapolis, 
  we &#8220;pull the covers&#8221; off to expose it as we continue our battle 
  against any who would deny qualified others equal access and equal opportunity. 
  Any thing we can do to encourage all involved to do the right thing we will 
  do. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Be very clear</strong>: we do not take up this challenge because Reggie 
  is Black but rather because although Reggie is a qualified buyer, the obstacles 
  thrown in his path are because he is Black. We fight red lining (the practice 
  of denying service to any living within a given areas) in all its forms, whether 
  the banking redlining related to denying mortgages to those with their map&#8217;s 
  redline circles or blocks, or whether related to viewing those within the color 
  red line of &#8220;not the same&#8221; or &#8220;dumber&#8221; and thus deny 
  quality education, jobs, housing, and public safety, or, in the Minnesota case 
  of Reggie, defining a Black person as a walking red line. We see signs that 
  Reggie is being redlined by racist innuendoes and shadow remarks and different 
  rules, just as Blacks were given different rules for qualifying to vote during 
  the jim crow days. This book, column, and web log fight racism and for any who 
  are under siege, White or Black, male or female, rich or poor, as continue to 
  stand up for equal opportunity against any who would deny it, be it the White 
  owners of the NFL or the Black officer of the NAACP. </p>
<p>In other words, as Fowler is qualified, <strong>we&#8217;ll now find out the 
  true hand of the NFL</strong>: will it take this long overdue step of no longer 
  blocking Blacks from being owners or it will it show its own segregationist 
  colors and hide behind the false and and inaccurate racist statement that they 
  have no bench depth in terms of Black executives? </p>
<p>In saying this we recognize that we will be accused of &#8220;playing the race 
  card.&#8221; Of course. You can&#8217;t win a card game without playing all the cards. 
  It is due to an obsession with political correctness that brings the blindness 
  to racism to the table. As we should have no racism and as we are good people 
  we can&#8217;t be racist. I pull the covers off this in my book in regards to education, 
  jobs, housing, etc. The contnued bottling up in our inner cities of a population 
  provide poor education, poor jobs (or none), and poor housing, is either out 
  of cruelty or out of a racist belief that they are not of any value above these 
  levels. So let us reword this: we are playing the &#8220;observe the racism&#8221; 
  card. The Strib itself published a series on racism in 1990 about the rampant 
  racism in the Twin Cities and Minnesota, as did the Mpls.St. Paul Magazine (see 
  my book&#8217;s Interludes 2 and 10). In a 2000 cover story on Dennis Green 
  the magazine noted the racism of Minneapolis was still well and very much alive. 
  Indeed, we made he case in our Column 2004/#25, December 2, 2004, discussing 
  the racist skin head company known as Panzerfaust records in S. Paul, the state 
  capital, makes and distributes racist CDs to middle and high school kids, bragging 
  proudly that &#8220;we don&#8217;t just entertain racist kids. We create them.&#8221; 
  So far, in the local White media: mum&#8217;s the word, although Panzerfaust 
  was covered by national TV news. Think about that: &#8220;we don&#8217;t just 
  entertain racist kids. We create them.&#8221; And the Twin Cities remain silent. 
  We believe the NFL will not be held to the racist blackmail offered by the so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; trying to discredit Reggie Fowler.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Will racism be allowed to be disguised as stupidity?</strong> Why do 
  these media types think Red McCombs is stupid, or that Reggie and the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadeal&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">partners</a> 
  Reggie is brining to the Minneapolis table are? Indeed, one of his partners 
  received $300 million in cash for his sale of his part of the New Jersey nets. 
  These are not poor people. If the NFL turns Reggie down, given the financial 
  strength of Reggie and his group, there can only be one reason for turning him 
  down: his color. For three years Red has been trying to sell his team. And for 
  three years there was no one to meet his price. Until now. And when it comes, 
  Minnesota &#8220;leaders&#8221; go nuts and rush to sabotage the deal and anoint 
  Glen as &#8220;The Great White Hope.&#8221;</p>

  attention to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060988967/qid=1109664555/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-4824662-8252627" target="_blank">ego 
  trip&#8217;s Big Book of Racism!</a> For people of color have put together a large 
  tome that will be enjoyed by people of all races and colors. It is politically 
  incorrect, hilarious, and deadly serious, all at the same time, as it catalogs 
  in serious and humorous ways the distance we &#8216;ve come, the distance we still 
  have to go, and the pervasiveness of race and racism underlying almost all social 
  interactions. For those who think it is old hat and history, this book will 
  quickly disabuse you of that. and for those who think no progress has been made 
  and that we still live in a pre-1964 world, this book will disabuse you of that 
  as well. It is a healtlhy and humorous reminder of the work we all must do together 
  so that we can work to make racism a thing of the past as everyone, Black or 
  White, keep their eyes on the prize together.</p>

  <strong>NFL: Whither Goest Thou: Association/Cartel/Monopoly/Good old Boys Club/Congressional 
  Action?</strong> The Vikings are owned, lock, stock, and barrel, by Red McCombs. 
  The Vikings are not owned by the NFL. Red wants to sell to Reggie. The notion 
  that a Finance Committee can block a person from selling his property to his 
  choice is skating on the dangerous grounds of monopoly business, of cartelization, 
  of being allowed to run a good &#8216;ol boys club of segregation and prejudice 
  at tax payer expense under Federal government protection. We in the Black community 
  have had to live with this dodge for hundreds of years. Only the massas can 
  approve sales so that only the &#8220;right&#8221; people own. The NFL has to 
  decide whether to continue to pretend it is a plantation and have someone challenge 
  it (and they have lost their several law suits) or whether they will lead the 
  way into the 21s century rther than bed dragged into it, kicking and screaming. 
  </p>
<p>
  Note that the NFL has a clever gauntlet path: first the Finance Committee. Then 
  the owners meet. The finance committe can recommend but the owners meeting as 
  a whole can still turn it down. Why? A club is a man&#8217;s private property. Has 
  the NFL gone so <strong>socialist</strong> that it would continue to operate 
  in a fashion that could kill the capitalist goose that lays its golden eggs? 
  This is not to knock its business model, its wisdom in understanding the real 
  competion is other leagues and other pulls on peoples time and discretionary 
  income, nor is this a knock on the brilliance of parity and a salary cap. The 
  Golden Goose is good. But let&#8217;s not kill it or injure it. As Art Model famously 
  quipped, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_04/b3817002.htm" target="_blank">&#8221;We 
  are 32 fat cat Republicans who vote socialist.&#8221; </a>Please recall 
  that the NFL has been challenged on these issues in the past it has lost. I 
  talk about my challenges in the Minneapolis Courts in Chapter 3 of my book. 
  I won every time. </p>
<p> There are those who see the legal as their edge. They want lady liberty to 
  set down her scales, keep on her blindfold, and work with her hands behind her 
  back so the scales are not used&#8230;We are hoping that the NFL listens to 
  the better angels of the NFL and not to the demons of Minnesota. Indeed, if 
  we may digress for a second, we believe the NFL offers a far more palatable 
  model for renewing our inner cities than anything the political cartels that 
  currently run inner cities as private plantation at the expense of those kept 
  there by poor education, poor or no jobs, and poor housing (see my book, <em>The 
  Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>, Chapters 7-9). </p>
<p>
  We believe it would be a boon to the inner city of Minneaopolis in many ways 
  for the developements of the St. Cloud Corridor and Mall of America II to go 
  forward. It would create a new <strong>golden triangle vision</strong> (see 
  my book, <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>, p. 262-263). We would 
  love to discuss it with both projects. Indeed, football, especially NFL football, 
  has captured the heart of the nation. Indeed, we believe that the next step 
  in this love affair will be the establishment of each team of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078521187X/qid=1109644539/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-4824662-8252627" target="_blank">web 
  log</a> by owner and coach and perhaps one contributed to by players 
  (indeed, no &#8220;fan plan&#8221; should be without one. For more information, 
  see <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/073820756X/qid=1109644539/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/103-4824662-8252627" target="_blank">here</a></strong> 
  and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072227125/qid=1109663024/sr=2-3/ref=pd_ka_b_2_3/103-4824662-8252627" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. 
  We don&#8217;t want to see anything hurt either the sport nor the NFL, neither its 
  players or coaches or executives. As agree with author Michael MacCambridge 
  and his 2004 book that the NFO is indeed <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375504540/qid=1109644405/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-4824662-8252627" target="_blank">America&#8217;s 
  Game</a>. </strong> Our position is that it is an ALL American game, for Whites 
  as well as for Blacks, and we believe the league will be strengthened and the 
  game on the field will be come better once the NFL breaks the color ceiling 
  and includes Blacks as owners and executives too. <br>
  <strong><br>
  The NFL is not Augusta, nor is it a college fraternity</strong>. The NFL is 
  not a private club, although all involved act that way. The NFL is not like 
  a fraternity where it can legally blackball someone (although it can work behind 
  the scenes to make it happen and then pronounce surprise and deniability in 
  arguments that have forced plausibility based on lawyer technicalities than 
  on fact and realty. NFL &#8211; Players Association relations and negotiations 
  could well be strained if it denies a qualified candidate, sending a signal 
  that qualified players who are Black need not dream of being hired as executives. 
  When the NFL has been challenged on these issues in the past it has lost. We 
  are hoping that they listen to the better angels of the NFL and not to the demons 
  of Minnesota.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Time for NFL Oz to come out from behind the curtain. </strong>The league 
  sometimes tends (or at least appears to) hide behind the skirts of an electronic 
  curtain with an electronically enhanced voice that booms its voice with its 
  oversized image on the big screen with its mysterious levers and dials. And 
  yet, behind the screen is a little group of guys protected by the US congress 
  and a fraternity like agreement of blackballing those they don&#8217;t want. 
  Whether true or not, here is what it looks like: the Finance committee is a 
  way for millionaires to keep out millionaires they don&#8217;t want to associate 
  with. And in case they make a &#8220;mistake&#8221; or if the larger group doesn&#8217;t 
  like whom the smaller group approved, the owners as a whole have a second chance 
  to blackball who they don&#8217;t want. How, in America, can we still have a 
  government protected AND government subsidized group able to interfere with 
  one of the most sacred of American rights: private property? </p>
<p>
  <strong>In reality, the deal is over.</strong> A man who owns property has sold 
  it to another. It is the NFL fiction that says the deal&#8217;s fat lady can&#8217;t&#8217;t 
  sing until the finance committee and the committee of owners tells her she can. 
  If Red accepted Reggie&#8217;s bid, it is over. Red&#8217;s property. Red&#8217;s 
  to sell. Reggie&#8217;s to buy. Done. Sign the papers. Exchange the money in 
  whatever forms it takes for the deeds and transfer papers. </p>
<p><strong>It is time to end the NFL Plantation System</strong>. Should the owners 
  meet and agree how they want to interact with each other? Of course. But in 
  America no one is to tell others who they can sell their private property to. 
  And certainly not when financed in great part by both the tax code and the taxpayers 
  of their cities and states. Teams are private property. But the NFL is federally, 
  state, county, and city subsidized.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Redlining of Black millionaires is a bit much.</strong> Banks used to 
  draw red lines on their map around Black neighborhoods. No one inside the line 
  could get a mortgage. Now Minneapolis &#8220;leaders&#8221; are trying to draw 
  a red line around Reggie. If they do, they do, but let&#8217;s not let Oz hide 
  behind his curtain and the skirts of the law in order to draw a red line around 
  a millionaire because of his color.</p>
<p>
  But before going on, we want to pause as <strong>we give our thanks to Reggie 
  Fowler.</strong> I have never met the man nor talked to him. All I know is, 
  Black or White, he is the only person among the 5 billion on this planet (and 
  the only one among the dozens of millionaires and billionaires of Minnesota) 
  who is man enough and bold enough to stand up for Minnesota&#8217;s favorite 
  team: the Vikings. He has shown this by giving Minnesotans two Valentines that 
  none of the White folks in or outside the state were willing to bestow on us 
  Vikings fans, and which none of our local rich folks were willing to bestow. 
  <br>
  On Valentine&#8217;s Day, Reggie Fowler gave us these<strong> two big Valentines:</strong>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>(1) First,</strong> <strong>he&#8217;ll buy the team </strong>from 
    Red at Red&#8217;s price <strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/sport/2004/09/01/04nfland.html" target="_blank">as 
    he is the only one recognizes the team&#8217;s value and fair market price.</a> 
    </strong> (when no one else would do so for the nearly three years the team 
    has been for sale, regardless of color or where they were from). Remember, 
    before Reggie, <strong>no local millionaire(s) or billionaire(s) would step 
    up</strong>. That no locals stepped up affirms in our mind that they wanted 
    the Vikings out of town. It is hard to tell what has changed their minds, 
    whether it is setting up Glen Taylor to buy to keep a Black man away or whether 
    it is because the folks pushing the St. Cloud corridor need the stadium as 
    an anchor for their development dream and now see that they need the Vikings 
    after all, or maybe both. Regardless, if this deal is killed over some manufactured 
    issue over Glen Taylor knowing legislative check writers and Reggie none, 
    we&#8217;ll know Anoka too wants the team but not with a man of color at the 
    helm in their midst. </p>
  <p><strong>(2) Secondly, Reggie promises to keep the Vikings in Minnesota and 
    not move them</strong>, with no threats like the previous two owners and with 
    <strong>no threats like Glen Taylor made</strong>: Glen says he&#8217;ll get 
    the team because Fowler will fail but then if taxpayers don&#8217;t give him 
    a new, taxpayer subsidized stadium, Glen says he&#8217;ll move the team anyway. 
    How come, if he is so confident he can get the legislature to pony up he makes 
    this &#8220;or else&#8221; statement? See the <strong>roll call of threats 
    at the end of Column 2005/#2</strong>. To these we need to add those recently 
    made by Taylor. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So thank you, Reggie. </strong>Not because you are Black. But because 
  you stepped up. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank">USA 
  Today reports that the owners believe the deal will go through</a>. This is 
  why the locals are working so hard to stop it. My impression is that we are 
  back to &#8220;Blacks need not apply, Whites only&#8221; (see the second half 
  of my column, <strong>2005/#4.</strong> How ironically coincidental, then, that 
  this is being done during Black History Month. Reggie stood up for the fans 
  when Red and Glen were and are ready to abandon them. Once finalized Reggie 
  says he&#8217;ll move here to live (Red often jetted to town the mornings of 
  the games and jetted home right afterwards). We assume Reggie will snow bird 
  part of the winter in Arizona. He&#8217;ll then truly have blended in with the 
  other rich Minnesotans. We applaud, as we&#8217;d like to snow bird also.</p>
<p>
  This bears repeating: I trust no one misses the irony that it is the Black man 
  who has come to White fans&#8217; rescue while all of the rich Whites have stood 
  mute on the side holding the exit door for the Vikings to pass through to leave 
  the state.<br>
  So if Minnesota is successful in getting the NFL to block Reggie, we will still 
  have had our opportunity to savor this moment. And if they deny Reggie when 
  he qualified in everything but color, they will be committing organizational 
  suicide. If they don&#8217;t want government interference they must play by 
  the rules. If the NFL closes the door on the future in the minds of their Black 
  players who want to earn, qualify for and apply for post-playing days executive 
  jobs, they will face a real crisis in their next negotiating round. </p>
<p>
  The NFL has already offended many, including their Black employees. But their 
  Commissioner, presumably speaking for all of them, raised the heat under their 
  own kettle putting themselves in hot water by saying, at the Super Bowl in Jacksonville, 
  that because there is no depth on the bench of Black Executives, front offices 
  not only don&#8217;t have to hire Blacks they don&#8217;t have to interview 
  them. This is a 21st century version of the 20th century book, &#8220;The Invisible 
  Man.&#8221; Black executives and Blacks capable of being executives, but the 
  NFL doesn&#8217;t see them. Does being color blind to the NFL mean only seeing 
  White. The saving grace is that the Commissioner said they would do better. 
  They can signal that by fairly and justly approving the deal already agreed 
  to by Red and Reggie. Their people, the nation, and he world are watching.<br>
  By the definitions used by Minnesota &#8220;leaders&#8221; as reported in the 
  Strib articles, if they were applied to current owners many would be denied 
  their teams as most had NO experience in the NFL nor as players or coaches or 
  NFL executives prior to buying their teams.</p>
<p>
  The question has been raised as to whether or not the Jacksonville statement 
  was set up in advance to establish why the NFL can turn Reggie down. We don&#8217;t 
  know. The NFL will soon let us know. The &#8220;no bench&#8221; statement in 
  itself is racist, prejudiced, and segregationist all rolled into one. Amazing. 
  Most Head coaches were former players. Yet with over 70% Black players only 
  1% of Head Coaches are Black (and that is after a recent increase). This can 
  only mean one of two things. <strong>(1)</strong> On average, the best Head 
  Coach and coordinator slots are not being filled with the beset because the 
  majority of candidates come from a tiny percentage of the qualified candidate 
  pool. <strong>(2)</strong> The NFL either doesn&#8217;t want Blacks in these 
  positions or, like the days when Blacks were denied being quarterbacks for being 
  too dumb, they are now denied executive jobs, including that of Head Coach and 
  owner, because they are thought too dumb. Either way the NFL loses. The NFL 
  players&#8217; association ought to be taking on the NFL as a protection for 
  its players when it comes time for those who later qualify to transition to 
  executive positions. </p>
<p>
  Staying with the same theme and applying it to the Vikings when Reggie (or any 
  other new owner) takes over the team, to hire the very best coaches means, in 
  all probability, statistically speaking, hiring Black coaches. Otherwise, the 
  new owner, White or Black, would not be drawing from among the best of a very 
  large best pool, having settled for selections from a tiny pool.</p>
<p>
  In his book <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1571687076/qid=1109646060/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4824662-8252627?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">&#8220;The 
  Red Zone: Cars, Cows, and Coaches,&#8221;</a></strong> Red McCombs, who has 
  owned other professional sports franchises, said he was warned about the then 
  Black head coach, Dennis Green. As McCombs wrote in his book (p. 192), &#8220;I 
  recognized his [Dennis Green&#8217;s] organizational skills. I was impressed 
  that the Vikings had a number of players, about half the team, who were not 
  big names when they came to the Vikings, who had developed into great players 
  under Dennis and his staff.&#8221; And here is Red&#8217;s key statement: &#8220;I 
  bought a much better football operation than I had ever dreamed would be there. 
  On the other hand, the business side, which I expected to be better, was&#8230;disappointing.&#8221; 
  Red was also impressed by Green, calling it &#8220;a strong endorsement,&#8221; 
  that in his nine years, &#8220;six or seven guys had left Green&#8217;s staff 
  to become a head coach or coordinator.&#8221; One only has to compare Red&#8217;s 
  two Vikings coaches to grasp the full understanding of what I am saying here.</p>
<p>
  Indeed, one commentator, obviously not with the Strib, wrote that <strong><a href="http://stevesilver.net/mt/archives/003351.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The 
  Vikings spent most of the &#8216;90s as Minnesota&#8217;s premier sports outfit,&#8221;</a></strong> 
  but now, ever since Green left, the result has been that <strong><a href="http://stevesilver.net/mt/archives/003351.html" target="_blank">the 
  team has become a &#8220;shameful&#8230;second-class organization.</a></strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>
  <strong>We are not writing this to condemn the NFL but to encourage it to stand 
  up like a man and face the 21st century. </strong>We applaud the NFL for tipping 
  its toe in the water in considering Reggie. But we don&#8217;t give points for 
  toes. We want the full man. Make no mistake: it remains unconscionable that 
  it has taken the NFL this long just to put its toe in. It is now time for the 
  full plunge.<br>
  We are also not unmindful that it took a Southern Texan, LBJ, to step up to 
  the plate with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. And we are not 
  unmindful that it is another Southern Texan, Red McCombs, more than any other 
  NFL owner, to step up to take this historic step. </p>
<p>
  But it will take more than a toe. Only full body action will do. Red has taken 
  the plunge. Now the NFL must also. We are concerned because we can see the NFL 
  shivering, pulling back, withdrawing its withered toe, and listening to the 
  nonsense of Minnesota. </p>
<p>
  And again, to repeat, we write this not because Reggie is Black but because 
  he is qualified. We write this as we fear the NFL will attempt to do the wrong 
  thing and cater to Minnesota &#8220;leaders&#8221; when it is the fans they 
  should be listening to. If Reggie were not qualified we would not be writing 
  this. The NFL can only save itself if it jumps in and stops fighting and instead 
  become part of the huge, historic, tectonic plate moving earthquake trembling 
  Tsunami that will crash over the last great White-only seawall barrier anyway. 
  This Tsunami will wash away the &#8220;Blacks need not apply&#8221; signs. Why 
  not be part of this solution rather be part of the doomed effort fighting it 
  that remains part of the problem?</p>
<p>
  <strong>We are at a significant and historic teachable moment in America as 
  a whole in general and for the youth of our inner cities in particular. </strong>So 
  I, for one, as a long time advocate of civil rights for minorities, rich or 
  poor, and as a life long Vikings fan, will hold good thoughts for the NFL to 
  do the right thing. As I said, over five billion people in this world, and only 
  Reggie Fowler was man enough to step forth with a vision to extend the tradition 
  of the Vikings here, and not threaten to move them nor beg for tax payer dollars. 
  Only Red McCombs has been man enough to accept an offer from a Black man. We 
  now expect the organization of the most manly of men&#8217;s group, the NFL, 
  will be man enough to not allow reactionaries to give them weak knees. We expect 
  to see men acting as men and standing up for the principle of private property 
  rights for Red and the universal right of our Declaration of inalienable rights 
  of everyone.<br>
  Fowler is very clear about the stadium and approaches it better than Red did, 
  better than Glen is doing, and certainly better than all the roll call of naysayers 
  who said no stadium, no team. </p>
<p>
  We are reminded of<strong> the Lincoln&#8211;Douglas debate of July 1858</strong>. 
  Most know what Lincoln stood for. But do we know just how stark the Douglas 
  position was? Here is a sample that sounds like what the Minnesota &#8220;leaders&#8221; 
  are working so desperately to establish White team ownership. Judge Douglas 
  said: &#8220;this government of ours is founded on the white basis. It was made 
  by the white man, for the benefit of the white man, to be administered by white 
  men, in such manner as they should determine.&#8221;
<p>This is why, in my book <em>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes</em>, I 
  refer to Minneapolis as &#8220;<strong>the last outpost,</strong> a city that 
  has mastered the harmful political and economic machinery for keeping minorities 
  &#8220;in their place&#8221; in terms of education, housing, jobs, and the war 
  on young Black men.&#8221; We can now add to the list: ownership of an NFL team.</p>
<p>
  One would think that we could get beyond the race card. But we all know that 
  black&#8221; IS the key color, not green, as we know that the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">NFL 
  helped Red by loaning him $100 million so he could outbid our local guy Hedrick</a> 
  (for those not on line, see San Antonio Express-News, August 8, 2002, p. 1A: 
  requires registration and payment to see article, entitled &#8220;Is stadium 
  McCombs&#8217; goal?&#8221;). $100 million isn&#8217;t bad. and to an out of towner to boot. 
  So why not for Reggie? </p>
<p>
  <strong>And</strong> the NFL is <strong>providing the $500 million financing</strong> 
  (or funding, its not clear which, although we suspect financing, not funding; 
  heard this on ESPN radio in May 2004) necessary to build L.A. a new stadium 
  (a gift to whatever new owner goes there). $500 million isn&#8217;t bad either. So 
  it isn&#8217;t green that counts, its Black. If Reggie was White, and if Reggie 
  was the only guy to come forth to meet Red&#8217;s price, don&#8217;t you think 
  the NFL would come rushing to his aid as it did Red&#8217;s? The NFL can make 
  happen what it wants to make happen. With Reggie having the money we know it 
  isn&#8217;t green that counts. It is Black. Those Blacks who are part of the 
  new &#8220;charter generation&#8221; of success are as blind as Whites in dismissing 
  the significance and importance of color in terms of those still pushed into 
  the Plantation of the inner city.</p>
<p>We read with interest the <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5243310.html" target="_blank">&#8220;no 
  taxes&#8221; leaders &#8220;organized&#8221;</a> </strong> campaign gainst a

  taxes for a stadium but a stadium all together, and not just a stadium but any 
  development. In other words, this is a NIMBY crowd, a &#8220;<strong>n</strong>ot 
  <strong>i</strong>n <strong>m</strong>y <strong>b</strong>ack <strong>y</strong>ard&#8221; 
  crowd, masquerading as progressives they are really <strong>reactionaries</strong>, 
  marching <strong>against</strong> economic growth, marching <strong>against</strong> 
  jobs creation, reacting <strong>against</strong> development that would bring 
  jobs and fight poverty. </p>
<p>
  In a word, they opposed the St. Cloud development project and are using their 
  anti-stadium stance as a smoke screen to cover they are opposed to all of it, 
  believing if they can block the stadium they can block much of the development. 
  They have their sand box. They got theirs there. Let others go elsewhere to 
  get theirs. Just as they like keeping Blacks sequestered in the inner city, 
  they want new Whites to stay out of their area also. Had the generations before 
  them had this attitude there would be no room for them. But now that they have 
  theirs, they are wiling to deny others, Black or White. These are not communitarians. 
  They are <strong>anti-communitarians</strong>. They are <strong>not progressives</strong>. 
  They are <strong>reactionaries</strong>. They are not concerned about tax dollars 
  as they don&#8217;t mind taxes for their projects. They fear the Feb 24, 2005, 
  Strib report that the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1557/5257552.html" target="_blank">Minnesota 
  House vote puts steam into building Northstar line</a>, which is the North side&#8217;s 
  answer to the South side&#8217;s $1 billion <a href="http://startribune.com/stories/535/5243149.html" target="_blank">Mall 
  of America Part II project</a>. So they want to hold back the North side, while 
  the vision and boldness on the south continues to bring good things to the residents 
  on that side of town as the Mall of America. We see these as two points of a 
  new, narrow, <strong>development golden triangle </strong>(again, see pp. 262-263 
  of my book for two others), with the three points being the Mall of America/Bloomington/airport, 
  the Northside of downtown Minneapolis, and Blaine/Anoka County. For fun, one 
  could add a fourth development golden triangle: Mall of America, Winter Park, 
  new stadium in Anoka County.</p>
<p>
  The Mall will get the needed investment dollars seeded by the state with focussed 
  taxes. What Anoka County is proposing is investment in the North side as well. 
  Why should the south get it all? And just as the South side is willing to invest 
  in itself for infrastructure, why is this small band of Anoka Luddites opposing 
  an investment that would bring so much to their neighbors and to the whole North 
  side?</p>
<p>
  But the fear remains regarding Reggie&#8217;s background. What surprises us 
  here is that his newly acquired PR firm acted as a loose canon, hiding behind 
  &#8220;just getting started.&#8221; Do they act on their own with every client 
  or is Reggie the only &#8220;lucky&#8221; one? This is not PR, this is DR, disastrous 
  relations. This is a billion dollar project being left in the hands of strangers 
  who are turning what should be a sure thing into an outside bet. With friends 
  like this Reggie doesn&#8217;t need enemies. Note how the Twin Cities media 
  piled on, from the Strib to the Pi Press, from stories to <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/150/5245303.html" target="_blank">Souhan&#8217;s 
  jokes column</a></strong> to the radio and TV stations, all making far more 
  about his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5244268-2.html" target="_blank">Reggie&#8217;s 
  resume</a> than is warranted. Literally dozens of stories between the print 
  and broadcast stories in the space of just a few days, a P nightmare. Reggie 
  became the butt of jokes from coast to coast, from New York City to Portland, 
  Oregon. The great &#8220;liberal&#8221; papers had a field day ridiculing this 
  field hand who had obviously lost his way and needed to be shown the gate back 
  to his place on the Plantation.</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to understand this <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5243046.html" target="_blank">situation</a> 
  got out of hand unless it was one of those &#8220;we all just &#8220;know&#8221; 
  the &#8220;right&#8221; kind of &#8220;PR&#8221; to use to talking about this own 
  of town Black guy. His PR firm should be demonstrating the strength Reggie is 
  bringing to the table, not only in terms of <strong><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">his 
  strengths in putting together big deals but also the strengths of his partners 
  (Alan, Zyggi, David), and his key executives (John and Kevin).</a></strong> 
  Not talking about his partners and key executives remains a mystery (this online 
  article is from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, February 15, 2005, p. A1, &#8220;Fowler 
  knows how to put a deal together.&#8221;).</p>
<p>
  Note: similar &#8220;piling on&#8221; stories have appeared in the St. Paul Pioneer 
  Press; as we are expert in Minneapolis, and as listing theirs would be redundant, 
  we leave it to the reader to look up their stories). Even though Reggie is new 
  at this there is still no excuse for this when so much is on the line. Why no 
  responses to these stories that portray Reggie as &#8220;less than&#8221;? The 
  insignificant errors have been addressed. Allowing them to be the story has 
  not been addressed. We are glad he has been <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5248826.html" target="_blank">setting 
  the record straight.</a> The key, however, is to get the team, assemble a great 
  staff and field a winning team.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reggie Fowler is not replaying the Denver Nuggets fiasco</strong> of 
  a decade or so ago. In the NBA&#8217;s attempt to land a Black owner in Denver, 
  they picked a Black man who fell on his face. He was overextended. The NBA was 
  under pressure to have a Black owner. They got one. He moved to town, got a 
  big condo, couldn&#8217;t meet payroll, and within a year was out, broke, a huge embarrassment. 
  The NBA had to scramble. This is how the Wal-Mart heir got the team and why 
  it took a decade before they went with their first Black majority owner, Bob 
  Johnson, in Memphis (Johnson was the founder of the BET network). Fowler is 
  also the real deal. As the articles point out, he has begun businesses in packaging, 
  aviation, construction, broadcasting, banking, real estate and a Disney theme 
  park.</p>
<p>
  All of this stumbling has just piled on the pre-announcement play by the &#8220;powers&#8221; 
  of the race card, in a story entitled &#8220;<strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236647.html" target="_blank">Taylor 
  hopes to hook Vikes</a></strong>&#8221; We posted our response to this in our 
  February 12, 2005 Blog entry <strong>2005/#17: Strib &amp; the</strong> <strong>Bosses 
  Play the Race Card: Put Fowler in his place. </strong></p>
<p>
  The Strib has wanted Taylor from the get go. Knowing the Reggie announcement 
  was about to be made, the Strib struck first with its story: <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936.htm" target="_blank">While 
  Fowler moves into position, Taylor maneuvers from sidelines,</a></strong> a 
  story filled with innuendo, positioning Taylor coming to the rescue. Rescue 
  from what? Rescue from the outsider who is a Black man. But we already know 
  being an outsider doesn&#8217;t matter, as Red was sold the team over the local 
  Roger Headrick. So what is the difference? Color. Being Black.</p>
<p>
  The positioning of stories and timing of releases seems a carefully calculated 
  PR campaign geared to cast enough doubt by the NFL Finance Committee to discredit 
  Reggie so he is denied. But that committee only looks at numbers. Reggie has 
  the numbers. Our fear is that the committee will think all of these stories 
  is Minnesota talking when it is only a narrow band of self-appointed &#8220;leaders&#8221; 
  who, claiming to be liberals are really reactionary when it comes to race, as 
  my book details. Note also: not a word of protest when Glen talks about moving 
  the team if he doesn&#8217;t get a taxpayers subsidized stadium.</p>
<p>
  If all the legislature needs is Taylor as owner, then we know the legislature 
  is ready to create a tax. And if they are ready, it doesn&#8217;t matter who 
  owns the team.<strong> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5236936.html" target="_blank">And 
  Taylor&#8217;s statement &#8220;he thought his stadium-linked offer might be better 
  received by the NFL than a straight cash deal from Fowler&#8221;</a></strong> 
  is more sabotage to open the door open to leave town. In the same story, Glen 
  presents the Wizard of Oz all powerful NFL myth again, as says about Red: &#8220;&#8221;If 
  the goal is just to get the maximum for the franchise, then I would continue 
  to negotiate with Fowler. But I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s necessarily the goal of the 
  league. It would be in the league and other owners&#8217; interest to get a stadium 
  built.&#8221; &#8220; Earlier he said the key was having a high franchise price. 
  Nothing he talks about is about the good of the team or the fan.</p>
<p>
  My fear is that they are now working the &#8220;ace&#8221; in the hole in the 
  Strib/Taylor/&#8221;powers&#8221; thinking, as expressed in the above referenced 
  USA Today piece: &#8220;The NFL does have a policy, a spokesman said, that &#8220;excessively 
  leveraged&#8221; acquisitions of clubs will not be recommended by the Finance 
  Committee. When Red had to get $100 million to make the deal to beat our locals, 
  it is obvious that the term &#8220;overleveraged&#8221; is elastic, meaning that 
  it will mean whatever they decide it to mean. Sort of like the queen in Alice 
  in Wonderland.</p>
<p>
  Finally, a word of thanks again to Reggie for bringing a spirit of grace to 
  the proceedings. Despite the banging in the press, Reggie continues with grace 
  and civility. In a word: a gentleman. He rides the white horse and wears the 
  white hat while the opposition ride the black horse and wear the black hat (unless 
  you want be like the dressed in black knight clothing, like Paladin in the &#8220;Have 
  Gun Will Travel&#8221; western, or like the Black Knight of the movie with the 
  same name. </p>
<p>
  <strong>The unasked question: if the NFL will finance the new stadium for L.A., 
  why won&#8217;t it do so for Minnesota?</strong> And Jay Weiner&#8217;s recent <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5193272.html" target="_blank">3 
  stadium solution</a></strong> echoes the same solution we recommended in our 
  2002 book and is the same as my publisher&#8217;s on his web site in 2000.</p>
<p>
  <strong>The big elephant in Minnesota&#8217;s living room: Reggie Fowler&#8217;s bid 
  for the Vikings</strong>. Clearly Reggie is being given the run around in the 
  local media, as seen in Sid Hartman&#8217;s columns (Sid speaks for the establishment), 
  who has designated Glenn Taylor as the &#8220;Great White Hope.&#8221; See Sid&#8217;s 
  columns <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/507/5212396.html" target="_blank">here</a></strong> 
  , <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/507/5225200.html" target="_blank">here</a>, 
  and <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/5195364.html" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. 
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>The big rhinoceros in the NFL living room is race</strong> and the NFL 
  admitted at this year&#8217;s Super Bowl that they are not proud of their past record 
  and are working to get out from under the eight ball and to get ahead of the 
  curve. Our easy recommendation: don&#8217;t let Minnesota block this legitimate 
  deal.</p>
<p>
  To blame colleges and universities for the lack of NFL Black front office executives 
  is an affront to all Blacks in the game that the NFL needs to address, especially 
  to those who have gone on to get legal degrees (as Commissioner Tagliabue has) 
  and business and other graduate degrees in, only to be told there is &#8220;no 
  bench&#8221;. The NFL has a program for bringing in Black coaches to training 
  camps to help build a bench. Why not a program for management trainees, especially 
  players who have ended their careers and have gotten advanced training/degrees 
  or excellent OJT? The real reason is racism. How do White executives take Black 
  executives to their White country clubs? The Augusta syndrome is prevalent widely 
  in the NFL, creating a stranglehold by White males on the best positions. Just 
  as the Supreme Court learned a great deal from Thurgood Marshall and again now 
  from Clarence Thomas, so too will the Senate learn from Barak Obama. And now 
  the NLF has a chance to learn from Reggie Fowler, who will teach graciously 
  and diplomatically. He will also prove to be a great asset to the league its 
  its future negotiations with players.<br>
  <strong><br>
  The NFL runs the risk of waking up the sleeping giant of players</strong> as 
  they could come to hold out for a career path that wouldn&#8217;t guarantee jobs but 
  which would guarantee equal access and equal opportunity. That is all they asked 
  on the field and it is all they ask for the executive and ownership suites. 
  There is a color ceiling. With nearly 100% of coaches being former players, 
  and with 70-80% Black players, something is amiss when only 1% of Head Coaches 
  are Black and it stated that there is virtually zero percent Blacks on the executive 
  bench, not to mention zero percent Black ownership. Clearly, the NFL is a house 
  divided. As Lincoln so eloquently pointed out, a house divided cannot stand. 
  It leads to civil war. The irony is that the NFL cuts itself off from some of 
  the best talent and, as a result, cuts themselves off from creative folks who 
  could help them make even more money than they do now. Segregation is not a 
  happy atmosphere and doesn&#8217;t get the best out of people while at the same time, 
  statisticall, excluding some of the best people. Those whofeel superior don&#8217;t 
  have a sense of urgency and those who resent the condescension and know that 
  their best won&#8217;t be acceptable outside a narrow &#8220;band width&#8221; of areas 
  does have a sense of urgency. The 21st century has arrived. All need to be on 
  board the 21st century train together.</p>

</p>
<p align="left">This makes us wonder if there is a Groucho Marx moment going on 
  here. Groucho famously said, &#8220;Any club that would have me for a member 
  I wouldn&#8217;t join.&#8221; We are intriqued by the question applied in reverse 
  to the NFL: what is wrong with the NFL that so many who are qualified to buy 
  a team (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/400richest" target="_blank">the 
  March 28 Forbes lists 341 American billionaires</a> (not to mention another 
  350 billionaires in outside the U.S.) And that doesn&#8217;t count the thousands 
  of &#8220;mere&#8221; multi-millionaires. We suspect that the NFL has let folks 
  know they don&#8217;t want them. That they will render the invitation. Than 
  no one need apply. How else do you explain no bidders for nearly three years? 
  Either the NFL turned away inquiries or hadn&#8217;t make up its mind yet because 
  of L.A. and wanted to wait, holding Red out to swing in the breeze (as they 
  controlled him, given they had loaned him $100 million to buy the Vikings). 
  We sense that same denial is now going on with Reggie because he is not &#8220;White 
  like us.&#8221; If this is so in the NFL it must end now. In the first part 
  of this Solution Paper #25, we listed 4 signal sets that had us concerned. Now 
  we see three more.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"> <strong>The first four were:</strong><br>
    (1) The Glen Taylor campaign signals<br>
    (2) The Star Tribune discredit campaign signals<br>
    (3) The Randy trade signals<br>
    (4) The Winter Park leak signals</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">One of the reasons we are so questioning of the NFL&#8217;s motives 
  is because of a column by Larry Fitzgerald on March 3rd, <a href="http://www.larry-fitzgerald.com/articles/Trading-Randy-Moss-makes-no-sense.htm" target="_blank">Trading 
  Randy Moss Makes No Sense</a>. Larry is one of the most insightful and accurate 
  sports reporters in the Twin Cities. His conclusion is that the trade &#8220;almost 
  guarantees that Reggie Fowler will not become the team&#8217;s new owner.&#8221; Larry 
  makes the case that this boneheaded move, leaving Reggie out of the loop, is 
  worse than any made by Mike Lynn and Bud Grant, as Brzezsinski joins them in 
  being forever associated as the down side of three of the greatest names in 
  Vikings football, Fran Tarkenton, Alan Page, and Randy Moss, and one who was 
  not, Herschel Walker. Larry outlines what could be the play: get rid of Randy 
  and his contract in order to lower the price for Glen Taylor. Larry thinks Reggie 
  may have been set up as a &#8220;patsy.&#8221; True enough. Except one thing. 
  Reggie Fowler is no run of the mill entrepreneur. As we wrote in the first section, 
  He is <strong><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">an 
  experienced businessman who knows how to put a deal together,</a></strong> having 
  begun businesses in packaging, aviation, construction, broadcasting, banking, 
  real estate and a Disney theme park, and his Spiral, Inc. is ranked 11th among 
  the top 100 black businesses specializing in industrial/services in 2004, according 
  to <a href="http://www.blackenterprise.com/BE100sItem.asp?Id=is20041011&txtSearchFor=Spiral%2BInc%2E&MaxResults=0&YearBegin=0&YearEnd=7&onLineInfo=Yes" target="_blank">Black 
  Enterprise magazin</a>e, and as also reported <strong> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank">in 
  USA Today</a></strong> If anyone can break the NFL hesitation, it is Reggie 
  Fowler. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"> <strong>New sets of signals:</strong><br>

  <strong> Let&#8217;s review what the tag team is up to.</strong> </p>
<p>
  We identified a &#8220;tag team&#8221; of the Strib and PiPress <strong>in our 
  March 7 update</strong>. It would appear that there are now three members on 
  the tag team opposing Reggie: <strong>(1)</strong> the Strib (and the locals 
  that feed it), <strong>(2)</strong> the PiPress (following the Strib&#8217;s 
  lead), and <strong>(3)</strong> the NFL. Let&#8217;s repeat that key statement 
  by NFL Chief Operating Officer Roger Goodell: <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5285918.html" target="_blank">&#8220;This 
  is not just about money. We&#8217;re selecting a partner, and that&#8217;s a 
  very important decision for an owner.&#8221;</a></strong> This is so grotesque 
  that we will be repeating it often as a reminder.</p>
<p>
  Can you believe it? How many times have we Blacks heard that from the Country 
  Club set? Even Howard Dean only sees us as janitors, maids, voters every two 
  years, or yassa boss organizations like the NAACP and, sadly, seemingly more 
  and more, the Congressional Black Caucus (See 2005 Blog entries #27 and #31).</p>

<p>
  <strong>Signal #5: The double standard for the White Coach and the Black new 
  owner signal</strong></p>
<p>
  As noted in Blog entry 3/15/05/#28: Double standard revealed by local press 
  for the White coach and the Black prospective owner, the Strib signaled its 
  Black &#8211; White distinctions. We detailed the White press&#8217; hysterics about 
  a resume the local PR firm put out without checking with Reggie Fowler in the 
  first part of this Solution Paper #25, on 2-28-05. The PR firm has since apologized, 
  and the questions clarified and answered (although the &#8220;damage&#8221; 
  had already been attempted). The Strib has lots of double standards. For instance, 
  the Strib has never really condemned Panzerfaust Records when it was up and 
  running in St. Paul, a company that distributed hate filled CDs to middle and 
  high school students. On their web site they boasted that &#8220;We don&#8217;t 
  just entertain racist kids&#8230;we create them.&#8221; Once we called them 
  on it (See 12-2-04 Column #25), the Strib finally ran a couple of stories, but 
  the group was shutting down and getting out of town after being busted for drugs.</p>
<p>
  But no amount of negative publicity was too much when it came to Reggie&#8217;s resume. 
  And yet when Vikings Coach Mike Tice tells a baldfaced lie that he didn&#8217;t 
  scalp Super Bowl tickets, gets caught, and has to fess up, we read nothing. 
  The Strib chooses to believe a White guy when he lies and cover up for him when 
  he is found to be lying, but won&#8217;t accept the word of Black man, even 
  after clarifications have been completed. First the Strib accepted <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5281703.html" target="_blank">Tice&#8217;s 
  denial that he scalped Super Bowl tickets</a></strong>, then printed the next 
  day their faith in <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5283803.html" target="_blank">Tice&#8217;s 
  faith that he is confident he&#8217;ll be cleared</a></strong>, and then left it to 
  the Pioneer Press to print the truth the next day, <strong><a href="http://www.twincities.com/mid/twincities/sports/football/11105091.htm" target="_blank">&#8221;Tice 
  says he scalped &#8216;05 tickets.&#8221;</a></strong> Hey Strib, why no outcry? For 
  us this is routine to question the Strib&#8217;s integrity and journalism, as they 
  keep providing more evidence of it. When we bring out Vol II of <em>The Minneapolis 
  Story</em> next month, we will index all of our exposures of the Strib and its 
  reporting.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Signal #6: The &#8220;Houston, we have a problem&#8221; with the process 
  signal<br>
  Signal #7: The &#8220;not White like us&#8221; signal</strong></p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s repeat again our 3/15/05 Blog entry #29 question, <strong>&#8220;Guess 
  Who&#8217;s Coming to [the NFL] Dinner?&#8221;</strong> And let&#8217;s repeat what the NFL&#8217;s 
  Chief Operating Officer, Roger Goodell said, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5285918.html" target="_blank">&#8221;This 
  thing is not just about money. We&#8217;re selecting a partner, and that&#8217;s a very 
  important decision for an owner,&#8221;</a></strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5285918.html"> 
  </a> We are sure the reader can see why this reminds us of the Sidney Pottier/Katherine 
  Hepburn/Spencer Tracy movie, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767821483/qid=1110973156/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-8743801-4651101?v=glance&s=dvd" target="_blank">&#8220;Guess 
  Who&#8217;s Coming to Dinner?</a></strong>&#8221;, when the daughter informs 
  her liberal parents that her fianc&eacute;e, who is coming over dinner that 
  night, is Black. Though liberal in speech they had a hard time accepting their 
  own words of integration and acceptance when they had to practice them. </p>
<p>
  So we ask, Why is the dinner invitation offered to Reggie Fowler by Red McCombs 
  being questioned by the NFL? Does this mean the NFL is trying to hang on as 
  a White only Plantation of owners with their teams of Black workers in the field 
  as long as possible? From our perspective it looks like the NFL is getting cold 
  feet and is changing the rules of the game after the game began. Its gone from &#8220;no money no buy&#8221; to &#8220;its not about money&#8221; but about &#8220;acceptance&#8221; 
  in a club of &#8220;partners&#8221;. All of a sudden its not a business but a 
  &#8220;family&#8221;? </p>
<p>
  The NFL has now changed the focus from money to the personal. But the courts 
  in recent years have made it abundantly clear that the NFL is a not a closed 
  club, that the owners own their property, and the NFL cannot command them as 
  if the NFL owns all the teams. We raised this issue in or February 28, 20005 
  section of this Solutions Paper #25. We stated then and we state again: <strong>&#8220;Reggie 
  Fowler is a qualified bidder for the Vikings.&#8221;</strong> End of story. The 
  sale should be proforma.</p>
<p align="left">The Vikings are Red McCombs private property. Reggie made a fair 
  market bid. Red accepted it. All the NFL has to do is verify financial capability. 
  Fair enough. Anything else is a smokescreen, as if rich grown men can&#8217;t get 
  along with another rich grown man. Commissioner Tagliabue needs to clarify Goodell&#8217;s 
  statement, especially in light of his own &#8220;no bench&#8221; comments at 
  the Super Bowl (see 2005 Blog entry #9). </p>
<p>
  To make sure they can get away with this, the NFL makes all bidders sign an 
  agreement that they won&#8217;t speak about it or sue the NFL if they don&#8217;t 
  get their bid. <strong>That is like legalizing blackballing, legalizing discrimination, 
  legalizing prejudice</strong>. <strong>We really question that this document 
  has any real legal standing.</strong></p>
<p>
  As the 3-9-05 article notes, Reggie and his partners held preliminary discussions 
  with league officials before the agreement. So all was on the table. Nothing 
  is new. And in hopes of getting Reggie to withdraw so they don&#8217;t have 
  to be caught in their Augusta Country Club exclusivity discrimination posture, 
  are they, as the articles seem to suggest, attempting to sow dissention between 
  Reggie and his partners hoping their partnership will fall apart. What about 
  that, NFL? What&#8217;s up with that?</p>
<p>
  And how serious is the NFL when we read in the 3-10-05 article that on the first 
  day of meeting, the finance committee only met for 45 minutes. Worse, two of 
  its members didn&#8217;t show up. This has all the signs of a process that is 
  being drawn out so the NFL can have time to figure out how to get out of approving 
  Reggie, time to &#8220;find something.&#8221; To set up the killer blow the next 
  day, Goodell says in the 3-10-05 article, when asked about Reggie&#8217;s finances, 
  &#8220;That&#8217;s the process we&#8217;re going through.&#8221; Then in the 
  3-11-05 piece he lets the cat out of the bag, exposing the horseshoe that seems 
  to be in the NFL glove: (and there has been nothing but silence since): <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5285918.html" target="_blank">&#8220;This 
  thing is not just about money. We&#8217;re selecting a partner, and that&#8217;s 
  a very important decision for an owner.&#8221;</a></strong> </p>
<p>
  How should those of us who have been waging the battle for equal access and 
  equal opportunity for over 40 years (not to mention an unbroken line of such 
  battling for 400 years) interpret this in any other way? Was this stated with 
  a wink, to let the White owners feel OK, that the Goodell statement raised the 
  bar to a kind of Augusta Country Club &#8220;blackball&#8221; process, and thus, &#8220;not to worry,&#8221; the Black guy won&#8217;t be let in, so that all will remain 
  White like us? Tell us it aint so, Paul. Tell us it ain&#8217;t so.</p>
<p>
  The NFL has special privileges granted by Congress. But discrimination on the 
  basis of color is not one of them. The NFL makes its money on tax payers, either 
  through taxes, tax subsidiized stadiums, games ordered on TV, or buying tickets 
  for the game at the stadium (not to mention apparel and a host of other memorabilia). 
  The NFL is not an OPEC cartel. Each owner&#8217;s team is his private property. The 
  NFL is not a partnership. Financial ability to buy a team is one requirement 
  that, although questionable (borrowers are not welcome), the NFL crosses the 
  line if it thinks it can deny Red the right to sell his property when selling 
  it to Reggie is OK with him and Reggie has the money. If the NFL does that it 
  will find out that the nation will then realize that &#8220;the emperor wears 
  no clothes.&#8221; &#8220;Not just about the money&#8221; changes the rules and 
  is clearly reads like the discrimination of a private country club. We are hoping 
  the NFL will prove us wrong, that Red&#8217;s deal is about money and money only, 
  as it should be.</p>
<p>
  Right now it looks as if the NFL is trying to see if can close the door on Reggie 
  without anyone noticing. Is the NFL signaling to its owners that it will be 
  OK to say no even though Reggie has the money? Tell us it ain&#8217;t so, Paul. We 
  are here to state, uncategorically, that it is not all right. If Reggie doesn&#8217;t 
  have the money, that is a different story. But everything we read in the papers 
  so far says he does. Therefore, approving the sale should merely be proforma.</p>
<p>
  Let&#8217;s re-look at the stark truth: for nearly 3 years, no one has offered Red 
  his fair market value. No one from the Forbes 400 richest list. None of the 
  worlds&#8217;s<strong> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/worldsrichest/" target="_blank">691 
  billionaires nor our nation&#8217;s 341 billionaires</a> </strong>made an offer. Nor 
  did any of America&#8217;s richest, whether billionaires or millionaires on the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/400richest/" target="_blank">Forbes 
  richest 400 list</a>. Nor did any of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/400richest/" target="_blank">Minnesotans 
  listed on the Forbes richest 400 list,</a> people like Dwight Opperman, Richard 
  Schulze, Glen Taylor, Carl Pohlad, James R. Cargill, Barbara Carlson Gage and 
  family, Marilyn Carlson Nelson and family, Whitney MacMillan, Stanley Stub Hubbard, 
  Cargill MacMillan, Jr., W. Duncan MacMillan, John Hugh MacMillan III (living 
  in Florida). Nor did any of the lesser wealthy (but wealthy enough to form a 
  Minnesota buying group) step up, such as Harvey McKay, John Cowles, Jr., or 
  old Vikings hands like Jaye Dyer, Skip Maas, Jim Junt, James Binger, or Elizabeth 
  MacMillan, who said they wanted to be partners in ownership with Red but then 
  Red changed his mind and froze them out (p. 190 of his book, The Red Zone: Cars, 
  Cows, and Coaches). When he put the team up for sale why didn&#8217;t they step up 
  during the past three years? None of these has come forward. This is why we 
  maintained for a long time that until recently that the plan was for the Vikings 
  leave Minnesota <a href="24rollcall.htm" target="_blank">(See our Solutions 
  Paper #24).</a> </p>
<p>
  Not one of them came forward to offer Red a fair market value (athough Glen 
  Taylor has always had an insulting bargain basement price on the table). Then 
  a Black man comes forth and the game is changed. All of a sudden its not about 
  money. Its about a club of white rich boys that want to keep it that way.<br>
  We are here to announce that in a world where the breeze of freedom is blowing 
  around the world and the chains of the oppressed are being broken in places 
  not dreamed of by many but always hoped for by us, the NFL is on the wrong side 
  of history if it takes the &#8220;Augusta country club subjective discrimination 
  prejudice&#8221; route. Augusta is a private club. </p>
<p align="left">The NFL, no matter how much it wants us to believe that it is 
  a single, strutting peacock with 32 feathers, has to understand that we all 
  understand the peacock is all for show, that it is really, legally, institutionally, 
  32 separate peacocks competing for one Super Bowl feather. Recent court decisions 
  have so decreed. It is 32 owners of individual private property who get together 
  to agree how to schedule games, what rules to follow, how to divide the shared 
  pies, etc. The NFL is not about a king with 32 Lords of their castle. It is 
  about a business where the medium of exchange is money, whether for tickets, 
  pay for view, TV packages, or purchasing a team, and the 32 teams are sovereign 
  entities of private property that can be sold at their discretion to anyone 
  who qualifies financially. Period.</p>
<p>
  If the owners turn down a Black man who has the money, we will all see the NFL 
  for what it is, an overt, in your face, country club racism fostering discrimination. 
  And by &#8220;we&#8221; I mean fans, players, tax payers, and legislators. We 
  are all watching. Let us know you are playing by your own rules, NFL, take away 
  our doubt. Tell us, show us, that you are not saying that the super rich in 
  your club can tell the lesser rich what they can and cannot own and that they, 
  especially if they are Black, must learn to stay in their place, outside the 
  country club (unless, of course, they are janitors, maids or waiters). Pollster 
  John Zogby reports that <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/2005_03.php#009838" target="_blank">46% 
  of this country identify themselves as owners of some kind of investment</a>. 
  That is a lot of people who believe in some form of property rights. This rapidly-growing 
  category, Zogby writes, &#8220;is a far greater determinant of how they will 
  vote and how they see their world than income, religion, race, marital status, 
  or size of individual portfolio.&#8221; When a &#8220;tectonic shift&#8221; to 
  46% of those polled considering themselves part o the investor class, somethng 
  significant is happening. Whatever it is, the NFL ignores this at its peril.</p>
<p align="left">We have sounded a bit negative. We don&#8217;t mean to. We mean to be 
  assess as realistically as possible. It has always been our aim to enable people 
  with extreme views to to find the common ground where all can work together. 
  To not write what we have written above would mean we would have to have no 
  doubts. Our 40 year history in this effort has taught us that until breakthroughs 
  occur we dare not take our eye off the prize and we dare not relax until the 
  prize is won. We believe we are at a crucial historic moment. We believe the 
  NFL is capable of making an historic breakthrough. We are here to encourage 
  them to do so. We are here to hold the NFL up to its own high standards. We 
  are here to encourage the NFL to listen to its better angels, to do the right 
  thing, and that if Reggie has the money, not step inbetween Red&#8217;s private property 
  rights to sell and Reggie&#8217;s to buy. Anything else would not be American. We 
  believe in the entrepreneurial American way. It creates jobs, enables wealth 
  creation. We believe in it for everyone, not just White folks. Reggie Fowler 
  has achieved greatly. If he has the money, he has earned his place at the NFL 
  table. We wait to be able to congratulate the NFL for, in the end, doing the 
  right thing: standing aside as one one owner sells his team to someone who has 
  bid and can pay. We perfectly understand the need of Reggie to first proove 
  he can pay. He can. The deal must now be consummated, sooner than later, so 
  that the new owner has time to gear up to be competitive.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Thus, we repeat our bottom line:</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Based on the </strong> <strong>media evidence</strong> 
  discussed in this Solutions Paper #25, and on 40 years of community activist 
  work and experience interacting with the mahstus and wannabe mahstus, we have 
  seen all the &#8220;put them in their place&#8221; tactics this country can throw 
  at a worthy Brother. You don&#8217;t have to meet Reggie Fowler (and I have not) to 
  know that, given his record, he is a positive force who will work well with 
  Minnesotans and infuse a sense of vision that is so needed (that I talk about 
  in my book, pp. 262-263) . We have our cautious eye on the NFL and will continue 
  to fight for what is right. But in terms of Reggie Fowler, unless something 
  happens not now envisioned, Reggie Fowler can make the application because he 
  is qualified to be the Vikings owner, as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">(1) he meets the <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5239946.html" target="_blank">financial 
    strength</a></strong> required by the NFL. <br>
    (2) one of his <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5238724.html">partners</a> 
    </strong>has professional (NBA) team ownership experience and all have plenty 
    of money. <br>
    (3) two of his closest aides, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5240948.html" target="_blank">Kevin 
    Warren</a> and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/5250622.html" target="_blank">John 
    Misler</a>, are old NFL hands as former players or executives in the NFL. 
    <br>
    (4). He is <strong><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=knight-fowlerknowshowtoputadealt&prov=knight&type=lgns" target="_blank">an 
    experienced businessman who knows how to put a deal together,</a></strong> 
    having begun businesses in packaging, aviation, construction, broadcasting, 
    banking, real estate and a Disney theme park, and his Spiral, Inc. is ranked 
    11th among the top 100 black businesses specializing in industrial/services 
    in 2004, according to <a href="http://www.blackenterprise.com/BE100sItem.asp?Id=is20041011&txtSearchFor=Spiral%2BInc%2E&MaxResults=0&YearBegin=0&YearEnd=7&onLineInfo=Yes" target="_blank">Black 
    Enterprise magazin</a>e, and as also reported <strong> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/vikings/2005-02-14-fowler-sale_x.htm" target="_blank">in 
    USA Today</a></strong> Thus he&#8217;ll be able to put this one together.<br>
    (5) he has a process for solving the stadium question. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I rest my case. </p>
<p>The NFL has come to the same conclusion. </p>
<p>The question now is whether or not they will do what is best for the team and 
  the league, and not get in the way of Red selling the Vikings to Reggie Fowler.</p>
