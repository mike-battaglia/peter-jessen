  <p>Without change, projections indicate that by 2025, there will be no African Americans in either the police or fire departments.

<p><strong>Congratulations to the Rev. Jerry McAfee,</strong> newly elected president of the Minneapolis branch of the NAACP, and to the new board members. This is an auspicious time.
  </p>
</p>
<p><strong>We just celebrated the life of Nelson Mandela,</strong> <strong>a man who proved a Black man can be a success as president of a country with both Blacks and Whites. </strong>Along with Archbishop Tutu&rsquo;s &ldquo;ubuntu,&rdquo; he demonstrated that &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; are more than slogans: they are action paths to unity.</p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis needs unity and reconciliation within the Black community and between White and Black people and institutions</strong>. Eyes are to be kept on the prize of <strong>equitable education, jobs, and housing.</strong></p>
<p>Our hope and prayer is that the branch will move to carry out the <strong>NAACP mission:</strong> &ldquo;to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination,&rdquo; helping to reverse the shattering of the African American political juggernaut from the outside and its implosion from the inside.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>We look to Rev. McAfee and the local branch to make this New Years&rsquo; resolution:</strong> provide the spark needed by a beleaguered and under siege African American community enduring well-calculated outrageous and dangerous attacks that are forces of nullification and reversal of the African American community, in:</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Education:</strong> reactionary forces, left and right, saying mis-education of African Americans is a mental health problem.</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Jobs in the police and fire departments</strong> diminishing: lowest number of African American applicants for police officers (first class in 25 years without an African American) and fire fighters (the lowest recruiting class number in 40 years).</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Jobs in general:</strong> diversity in hiring purposefully denied. Examples: transportation (road and light rail), Vikings Stadium (the largest public works project in Minnesota history, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Justice:</strong> white washing police action. Example: T.T. Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Housing.</strong> Example: substandard government housing, the American Heritage/Hollman project.</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Politics:</strong> no Black representation in City Hall and only two Black state senators.</p>
<p><strong>Without change, projections indicate that by 2025, there will be no African Americans in either the police or fire departments. </strong></p>
<p>In the city of Minneapolis, as in Detroit and Baltimore,<strong> liberals and Democrats have used their majorities to turn back the clock, while Republicans and conservatives approvingly watch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That is the wrong kind of unity. </strong>Our great need is to reconcile and unite within our community and, as in South Africa, with Whites. African American school youth, especially Black males, are being suspended in record numbers, with &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; being used as a procedural justification.</p>
<p><strong>We also need New Year&rsquo;s resolutions from the incoming mayor and other liberals on the city counci</strong>l (who claim once again that they are working on a racial equity plan): to provide equity action results, not more plans. The African American community is not a part of the planning: &ldquo;plantation&rdquo; all over again.</p>
<p><strong>Circumstances are further complicated by the absence of an African American presence in City Hall</strong>. These are desperate times, and desperate circumstances calling for precise plans and precise strategies. Abundant outlines for finding answers exist (UM, HHH School of Public Affairs, archives of NAACP, Urban League, past Civil Rights commissions, my web site, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The re-emergence of NAACP branch</strong> to move with dispatch and effectiveness to recapture lost opportunities and prevent future losses would be a godsend<strong> to help reverse the demise of the African American community as a viable group of citizens. </strong>We urge the branch to <strong>hold hearings on issues that foster a house divided</strong> (see list above), and <strong>add hearings about the purposeful reversal of historic achievements</strong> of success in government and private sectors.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1351d1218" id="c1351d1218"></a>December 18, 2012 Column #51: A great injustice: the death of T.T. Franklin.</strong> <strong>Why another farce of a police report?</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Pull quote:</strong> The family and the African American community are owed more than the sham that was the Grand Jury investigation under the current county attorney, Mike Freeman.</p>
<p>When the <strong>police version of the circumstances</strong> surrounding their May 10, 2013 basement <strong>shooting death of Terrance Terrill Franklin</strong> was published September 26, 2013, <strong>so-called leaders, Black and White, seemed to finally breathe a sigh of relief.</strong> Since writing four 2013 columns on Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s death (May 22 and 29, June 12 and June 19), I have waited to see how protesters and defenders alike would express their opinions. <strong>Were opinions expressed truly passionate or just merit badges of protest or defense to wear in public and do nothing else?</strong></p>
<p><strong>These protest and defense rituals have been too long the routines in this city and cities across the country.</strong> Rallies and statements of either outrage or reports white washing the suspicious death of yet another African American, are followed by the silence of protestors and defenders alike. <strong>Why do print, broadcast and digital media continue to avoid relevant questions</strong> about that May 10th police shooting death of Terrance Franklin?</p>
<p><strong>The 228-page police report of September 26, 2013, is a cover up, </strong>pure and simple. It became more ridiculous and suspicious the longer it took to be released, reinforced by the so-called Grand Jury &ldquo;findings.&rdquo; It is rumored that the family is considering filing a civil law suit in January, in state or federal court. We would hope so. In the spirit of the pursuit of justice, Terrance Franklin&rsquo;s family and the Black community is owed that examination, an examination that should include:</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>That officers involved</strong> in Franklin&rsquo;s death<strong> be required to testify under oath in open court</strong> about the circumstances and conditions of police actions on the afternoon of his death.<br>
  &bull; That f<strong>orensic evidence be examined under oath.</strong><br>
  &bull; That Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s side of the aisle be allowed to <strong>cross-examine those testifying.</strong><br>
  &bull; That Mr. Frankliin&rsquo;s side be allowed to <strong>put their own experts on the stand.</strong><br>
  &bull; That <strong>investigators</strong> of those three days, May 10-12, be required to <strong>testify under oath</strong> and be examined by Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s attorneys.<br>
  &bull; That <strong>those who prepared the police version</strong> of Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s basement death<strong> be required to give testimony under oath.</strong></p>
<p>The family and the African American community are owed more than the <strong>sham that was the Grand Jury investigation</strong> under the current county attorney, Mike Freeman. <strong>Justice calls out that this clear and concise examination process be initiated and made the order of the day</strong> within the public arena of the court system. From discussions and conversations in our community, I know <strong>our community has not accepted as credible the sham report </strong>of the so-called circumstances that led to the death of T.T. Franklin on May 10, 2012.</p>
<p>It is only fitting that <strong>as we reach the close of 2013 and as we witness the crushing of the African American community&rsquo;s political base</strong>, that we at least attempt to have one last great hurrah in 2013, in the search for justice in the name of justice.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong> <br>
  <strong>This is written on December 10, the day of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s Memorial Service</strong> broadcast around the world. We pause to say prayers for his family and for his nation of South Africa. We remember him by the words used to describe him and wonder when Minneapolis leaders, Black and White, will earn these words also: <strong>truth and reconciliation, forgiveness and compromise, Constitution and Bill of Rights, comfort and consolation, freedom and justice, liberty and democracy.</strong> A humanitarian supporter of human rights, Nelson Mandela had the same dignity, grace and humility of such great warriors for peace and justice as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr, and Mother Teresa. Farewell and God bless you.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>

  <p>Giant trucks with White workers rolled onto Metrodome property celebration morning, December 2nd. No people of color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hallelujah! The great occasion of the <strong>beginning</strong> of construction preparedness and building of the <strong>Peoples&rsquo; Stadium</strong> arrived:<strong> December</strong> <strong>2, 2013.</strong> &ldquo;Mission accomplished&rdquo; or another December day in infamy?</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Success&rdquo; is to be measured by the language of promises and guarantees in the stadium legislation</strong> and by the pronouncements of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA). Promised:  full participation of all Minnesota&rsquo;s citizens:</p>
<p>&bull;	Nothing but Minnesota workers on the stadium<br>
  <br>
  &bull;	All steel produced in the United States, preferably from Northern MN&rsquo;s Iron Range<br>
  <br>
  &bull;	No cost overruns<br>
  <br>
  &bull;	Equity Plan and Diversity Plan for Minnesota&rsquo;s minorities and communities of color.<br>
  <br>
  &bull;	MSFA Construction Services Agreement Equity Plan: targeted business goal;  20 percent (11 percent women-owned businesses; nine percent minority-owned businesses) and targeted workforce goal (32 percent minorities and six percent women) in all hours worked.<br>
  <br>
  &bull;	At the October 12, 2012, MSFA meeting, I asked <strong>Ted Mondale, MSFA CEO/Executive Directo</strong>r about those numbers. He said, &ldquo;This is not like the Target Field project. They had no numbers for compliance, nor was there a plan. You need to give us a chance, Ron.&rdquo; OK, Ted, 400-plus days have passed. Where&rsquo;s the promised plan? <br>
  <br>
  &bull;	February 8, 2013: <strong>MSFA Chairwoman,</strong> <strong>Michele Kelm-Helgen</strong>, said that serious questions had been raised about the equity plan implementation passed by the MSFA that same day. Hey, Ted, that was 296 days ago. When will we be able to shout out a halleluiah for an equity plan?</p>
<p> <strong>EDITOR&rsquo;s NOTE:</strong> See column of  October 17, 2013: <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2012/columns/12q4.htm#c1242d1017" target="_blank">Vikings stadium officials promise 32 percent diversity hiring! But no one seems to have a copy of the equity plan</a>:
<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually Ted Mondale stepped up to help reverse decades of public and private lying: &ldquo;This is not like the <strong>Target Field</strong> project. They had <strong>no numbers for compliance</strong>, nor was there a plan.&rdquo; He then stated the heartening,<strong> &ldquo;You need to give us a chance.&rdquo;</strong> Both Mondale and Kelm-Helgen, during and after the meeting, said they hoped I would work with them, help them, and advise them.&rdquo; </p>
</blockquote>
They never asked.
</p>
</p>
<p>Are choirs of angels singing<strong> &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo;</strong> as we echo &ldquo;We have overcome,&rdquo; and sing &ldquo;Free at last, free at last, God Almighty, free at last,&rdquo;<strong> or are those shouts of lamentation and the shedding of tears?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giant trucks with White workers</strong> rolled onto Metrodome property celebration morning, December 2nd. <strong>No people of color.</strong> Excluding people of color from this great historic event must not be allowed to stand.</p>
<p><strong>Hey, Ted Mondale,</strong> recall stadium legislative language, Section 17, Subdivision 473J.12, &ldquo;Employment,&rdquo; lines 18.33 through 19.7. <strong>Why are you again allowing the shattering of opportunity dreams of enjoying economic benefits of the Peoples&rsquo; Stadium for people of color?</strong> <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How many of both stadium law suits for failure to comply with diversity and equity legislation and for environmental concerns will have to be filed to get your attention, and at the cost of much delay costing many more millions?</strong></p>
<p>Minnesota can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;whole&rdquo; when people of color are again betrayed. <strong>Using designated programs as equity, diversity, affirmative action, minority business operations will no longer work as smokescreens hiding false promises.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do the sports authority and our own Black leadership,</strong> making out together in the back seat of the stadium convertible, <strong>think no one is watching</strong> in this day of iPhones that record audio and video?</p>
<p><strong>Do Black and White &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; not know that not all of our dreams can be bought off and corrupted?</strong> Do they not understand that with Martin Luther King, Jr. <strong>we too &ldquo;have a dream?&rdquo;</strong> Ask quickly and with dispatch: was there ever any intention to allow African Americans to participate in and enjoy working on this one billion-dollar project?</p>
<p><strong>The chilling absence of African Americans on site December 2nd bears frightening witness to the absence of a plan (or a refusal to follow one). </strong>We will remain positive and upbeat until we see the intent of the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; clearly, to be revealed by the first legislative directed<strong> report and evaluation of</strong> the overall stadium work and statistical data on <strong>minority participation</strong>.</p>
<p>The report <strong>must be submitted annually on January 15 </strong>(per stadium legislation section 14.16 under sec 13, 743J.09, &ldquo;Powers and Duties of the Authority,&rdquo; lines 14.16). Not so ironically, January 15th is Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1349d1204" id="c1349d1204"></a>December 04, 2012 Column #49: &ldquo;To the extent practical&rdquo; escape language in legislation allows steel purchase outside Iron Range.</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Pull quote</strong>: No outrage when Blacks are left out of diversity hiring, but there is outrage in this lack of White diversity in distribution of tax payer dollars.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Sports Facility Authority met November 22, 2013, to sign the contract to put the final stadium construction process and procedures into place. The local daily newspaper&rsquo;s picture of John Wood of M.A. Mortenson, shaking hands with a colleague, with a large group of people smiling and applauding in the background, <strong>shows how well steel facts were withheld</strong> as happy faces turned unhappy within 24 hours of the signing, as people <strong>realized not all the steel would come from Minnesota, as &ldquo;promised.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The legislative language: &ldquo;to the extent practical&hellip;MN steel&rdquo;</strong> (see Stadium legislation, Section 11, lines 2423-2424) is the escape hatch from &ldquo;all Minnesota&rdquo; steel. <strong>This is how the State and City continually get away with not hiring Black Americans on construction projects, using equivalencies of &ldquo;good-faith&rdquo; effort</strong>, as we&rsquo;ve long reported. <strong>Now its the Iron Range White man&rsquo;s turn</strong>, as 20 percent of stadium steel will come from steel mines of ArcelorMittal (in the Duchy of Luxembourg, Ruhr Valley, near Germany). After Mittal bought Arcelor in 2006, the Mittal family of India has owned 40 percent of ArcelorMittal.</p>
<p><strong>The issue is not where the steel comes from (you want the best so the stadium doesn&rsquo;t collapse).</strong> <strong>The issue is a few legislators deliberately misleading the rest to get their vote</strong>, needlessly creating controversy  and rage when Iron Range voters learned of the 20 percent coming from the Duchy of Luxembourg only after the contract was signed. Minnesota stadium dollars will now go overseas, to Luxembourg and India <strong>(this also reduces credibility for future discussions and negotiations).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key politicians would have taxpayers believe that in early 2012, while finalizing the legislative language, they didn&rsquo;t know that the best quality steel for part of the stadium would be found outside Minnesota (but they did, hence the escape language: &ldquo;to the extent practical.</strong>&rdquo; This column (2012, 2013) has consistently raised questions about the steel needed to erect this mammoth &ldquo;people&rsquo;s&rdquo; &ldquo;multi-use&rdquo; stadium. Their silence got the legislation passed. How many other &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; are waiting? </p>
<p>See October 17, 2012, column: <strong>Vikings stadium officials promise 32 percent diversity hiring! But no one seems to have a copy of the equity plan</strong>, and December 5, 2012, column: <strong>Still waiting for the Equity Plan for the new Vikings&rsquo; and Minnesota&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Stadium</strong>.  See also the November 22, 2011 aggregate of columns and solution papers at <strong>DISPARITY/COMPLIANCE STUDIES</strong>: <strong>Minneapolis Practices Disparity And Purposefully And Actively Avoids Compliance</strong>
(list of columns going back to 2005).</p>
<p><strong>The anger, outrage, and sense of betrayal in the Iron Range is understandable</strong>, as they had been led to believe that all steel preparation would come out of Northern Minnesota. Now if this Black journalist understands that the steel would have to come from other global locations, <strong>the legislators, key Iron Range movers and shakers, and Star Tribune knew also. They just chose to be silent until the contract was signed.</strong></p>
<p>As ArcelorMittal has two subsidiaries in the Iron Range, Essar Steel Minnesota LLC and ArcelorMittal Minorca Mine in Virginia, MN, ArcelorMittal will double dip as Minnesota tax payer money goes to Luxembourg and India.</p>
<p><strong>No outrage when Blacks are left out of diversity hiring, but there is outrage in this lack of White diversity in distribution of tax payer dollars. </strong>Even though the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority says high quality out of state steel will only cost $5 million, <strong>it is clear a forensic auditor is needed to make sure the integrity of Minnesota taxpayers is protected.</strong> That would include an examination of the production of the steel made by the ArcelorMittal company in Luxembourg and the work of their Essar and Minorca subsidiaries in the Iron Range.</p>
<p><strong>There is no mystery. The discipline to withhold information until after the contracts were signed is impressive. Again: what else has been withheld?</strong></p>
<p>Business interests with relationships with the European subsidiaries in Northern Minnesota knew about this 20 months ago, and so too did those behind the scenes working for &ldquo;escape&rdquo; language in the legislation. So, Minnesota taxpayers, dig deeper <strong>while thinking of the wonderful stadium that is supposed to be under your Christmas tree by 2016.  By 2016?  Really?</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="c1343d1023" id="c1343d"></a>November 27, 2012 Column #43: Is President Obama a &lsquo;lame duck&rsquo;? You be the judge. </strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards <br>
  </em><em>Featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder<br>
  </a></em><br>
In the last 20 days, discussion on both the left and the right has been about the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the real name of what both sides call &ldquo;Obamacare,&rdquo; long a term of pride for Democrats and one of derision for Republicans, and now one of confusion for both. <br>
With the elections of 2014 and 2016 looming, both parties are nervous, with the most scared trying to summarize it all in the term &ldquo;lame duck.&rdquo; This is another way for both sides to not address the problems they fear: health care, education, housing, immigration, foreign affairs, entitlement programs, etc. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Lame duck&rdquo; won&rsquo;t work. Obama has the courage and determination to persevere. </p>
<p>One of two things will happen to the ACA: (1) repealed and replaced, or (2) kept but greatly modified. Regardless of which, it will be resolved and be part of Obama&rsquo;s lasting and positive legacy, regardless of the election results of 2014 and 2016.</p>
<p>Those complaining about how the president is being treated didn&rsquo;t say a word when people ripped into &ldquo;W&rdquo;, including calling for his assassination. And the conservative complaint that Obama is trying to get the government to be in charge of everything also won&rsquo;t wash as a left-only goal, given what Reagan and &ldquo;W&rdquo; did, and given that the first to propose it was a Republican, Teddy Roosevelt. </p>
<p>So both sides, not the &ldquo;other&rdquo; side, are to blame. How to return power to the people is a needed debate. </p>
<p>On this 150th anniversary of Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg address, let&rsquo;s live by his rejuvenating words: &ldquo;All men are created equal&hellip;unfinished business&hellip;a new birth of freedom&hellip;government of the people, by the people, for the people.&rdquo; Lincoln recognized the need to provide freedom and full citizenship to all, especially African Americans. We must persevere until we can stop obstacles being created, even now, 50 years after the civil rights legislation. </p>
<p>Calling the president a &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; is wishful thinking, showing how silly and lazy even some serious people can be. This president will persevere. History will mark his accomplishments, including those yet to come during the remaining three years of his term as he addresses how to stabilize quality of life, security, and the economy.</p>
<p>The president won&rsquo;t fold. As he said in an address to the nation, none of us is perfect. But neither were the Founding Fathers perfect, and neither was the implementation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights perfect (slavery being the most serious imperfection). </p>
<p>One of the problems in the discussion of President Obama&rsquo;s performance is the inability for some and outright refusal by others to discuss racism. No race, no people, and no nation are perfect. But we can step aside from what is clearly imperfect and take corrective action that brings respect, protects the rights of others in shared community, and rises above the difficulties of racist biases and prejudices, individually and as a society.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; is literally impossible, so let&rsquo;s concentrate on the possible: the promises of opportunity and hope for all in education, jobs, housing and public safety. President Obama will not believe the &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; propaganda. He will continue his commitment, love and respect for the nation he leads. </p>
<p>Let us not think &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; but instead think about our future, our children and our children&rsquo;s children, because that is what is at stake. We need the kind of leadership that made Barack Obama so attractive to the American voters, not once but twice. We pray that, with God&rsquo;s help, he will continue to persevere in serving the people of this nation, and do so successfully.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1347d1120" id="c1347d1120"></a>November 20, 2012 Column #47: Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau is doing a good job. No need to replace her</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Pull quote:</strong> For the first time in three decades there is no African American on the Council.</p>
<p>Minneapolis celebrates the election of its second female in the history of City Government, Betsy Hodges, bringing discussion about her representing diversity balance. Really? How, when for the next four years there will neither be an African American nor Native American on the City Council (and not in St. Paul either)?</p>
<p>This is another reason why it is surprising that less than a week after her announced victory the first rumors about change to emerge from City Hall was consideration being given to replacing Police Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau with an assistant police chief from Seattle, Washington. Why are she and her advisors so politically tone deaf?</p>
<p>This is not good stewardship of our politics. Chief Harteau has been on the job barely a year. After some missteps (typical of all new chiefs of anything, just as it is for any new mayor and will be for our new mayor), Chief Harteau has begun to work herself into the job and into her responsibility. She has been building bridges both within the department and between the department and the community.</p>
<p>In light of that, I do not understand the thinking of the mayor-elect and her advisors to create friction between Native American and other communities, even in light of the fact that the rumored desired replacement in Seattle is an African American. Why would mayor-elect Hodges want to drive a wedge between Native Americans and others, especially African Americans, when such a change has no discernible merit?</p>
<p>For the first time in three decades there is no African American on the Council. So let us repeat: for the next four years we will have a Council with no African American and no Native American. The rumored &ldquo;safe&rdquo; way to make the change &mdash; pay the chief a one-year severance in January and demote her back into the ranks &mdash; is any thing but, especially in light of the center-stage, high-profile, police-misconduct cases in Apple Valley and, specifically, Green Bay.</p>
<p>This does not bode well for the future given the delicate circumstances requiring delicate resolution by both the mayor and the chief. The chief has been working tirelessly to make sure everything is done to properly resolve these cases.</p>
<p>If the decision of the mayor to remove Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau is simply because she can, then the Hodges administration would be getting off on the wrong foot, causing injury in this city across the board (racially, politically, socially). Chief Harteau has done nothing to cause consideration of being removed and be so greatly disrespected.</p>
<p>The new incoming mayor has said she is sensitive to the concerns and thinking of all communities of this city. Really? We call upon her to show needed sensitivity, due diligence and, dare we say, wisdom, by maintaining the tenure of Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau.</p>
<p>How did this issue top the list when so many other important development and service issues need to be dealt with to get the city back on track? </p>
<p>Development issues: Vikings stadium, peoples plaza, light rail, Nicollet Mall, rehabilitation of Target Center, rehabilitation of E block, etc. </p>
<p>City services issues: improving education, job growth, housing policies, interacting with other government agencies and bodies (federal, state, county, other cities), diversity in hiring with the Vikings stadium, and reducing law suits against the city.</p>
<p>These issues place a tremendous weight on the new administration. The idea of starting out with steps whose goal seems to be pitting one community against another will not bring stability in race relations nor harmony in general to the city, regardless of such demographic distinctions.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable. Tell us it isn&rsquo;t so, Madam Mayor. </p>
<p>Chief Jane&eacute; Harteau must stay.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1346d1113" id="c1346d1113"></a>November 13, 2012 Column #46: Violence Grips Downtown. One dead, three wounded, in night of terror.</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>When shots rang out around 11:53 pm, Saturday night, November 2, 2013, at the Epic nightclub in downtown Minneapolis (or 1 am; reports vary as this is written just two days after the shooting) the crowd of over 2,500 partygoers disbursed in panic. See Star Tribune, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/230591691.html" target="_blank">Epic nightclub faces pressure after fatal shooting at rap concert</a>, November 3, 2013). <br>
  <br>
<strong>The concert featured Yo Gotti,</strong> a prominent and legendary rapper. Because of violence associated with his concertgoers, the Minneapolis Police Department prepared for violence outside Epic with pepper spray and riot equipment, but not <strong>inside, where there were 40 well-trained security personnel along with six off-duty Minneapolis police officers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The assassin was able to approach the VIP section, gun down and kill 27-year-old Tyrone Washington with precision and dispatch</strong>, and then leave, unnoticed and unapprehended. Clearly this was <strong>not a shooting of random victims</strong> (as at schools, theaters and workplaces). This was a <strong>well-planned, well-coordinated, purposeful </strong>murder by assassination of a gang world individual.  The precision <strong>suggests this had nothing to do with the concert or African Americans, just the victim.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A chilling question:</strong> Why was Mr. Washington picked up and removed to the sidewalk outside the club, where he expired, instead of being given first aid medical attention? The attacker&rsquo;s precision raises questions about complicity and conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>How the city will address this is not yet clear.</strong> Politically, since Mr. Washington&rsquo;s death, the question has been raised whether Black entertainment groups should be allowed to perform in the City of Minneapolis (See Star Tribune, November 3, 2013, Epic nightclub faces pressure after fatal shooting at rap concert.  Too many of these statements are painting the entire Black community with a broad brush of recrimination and lawlessness. <strong>Why aren&rsquo;t Whites painted the same way for their behavior at heavy metal concerts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The city goes to great lengths to maintain</strong> that when a peace officer is out of control &mdash; be it Apple Valley or Green Bay or in the death of TT Franklin &mdash; <strong>that the department should not be painted with a similar broad brush.</strong> It is vastly unfair to incriminate many for the actions of a single individual. I&rsquo;m told the downtown Council and others in the business leadership are <strong>pressuring the city to stop allowing entertainment engagements that will attract large numbers of African Americans.</strong> Shame on Don Samuels for saying the same thing, sacrificing our community in an attempt to obtain White votes.</p>
<p><strong>The lack of leadership in the White and Black communities</strong> and the lack of adequate debate about the issue of racial, economic, and entertainment profiling, is drawing attention away from all events that took place prior to and leading up to the death, as this death is not considered relevant to the bigger picture: a safe downtown for White citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Needed is a commitment to end racial, economic and entertainment apartheid by Whites</strong>. Needed is the admitting of the fact that there are <strong>a lot of problems brought to town by White, heavy metal and other kinds of entertainment groups.</strong> The popular and effective attack on the character of our Black community and <strong>fear of a Black presence in downtown and the city as a whole must stop.</strong></p>
<p>It would be unfair for the new mayor and new council to strip the license of the club and close the property down. As it is <strong>a very economically attractive property across from the Twins ball park, whites will be able to do all kinds of things with it once it is racially cleansed.</strong></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this agenda continues. Sadly, it is questionable whether the assassin of the African American will be apprehended. We can only hope that racial, economic, and entertainment profiling will be ended.<br>

<p><strong><a name="c1345d1106" id="c1345d1106"></a>November 06, 2012 Column #45: Mr. Bellecourt is right! &ldquo;Redskins&rdquo; Controversy Heats Up Again.</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>November 6, 2013</p>
<p><strong>This column identifies with, respects and supports Clyde Bellecourt&rsquo;s request to NFL,</strong> Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority,<strong> don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;Redskins,&rdquo;</strong> even if the NFL does.  We stand in <strong>unity against racism,</strong> for far too long a part of the American and Minnesota landscapes. </p>
<p>The <strong>Jewish owner of the Washington Redskins</strong> NFL team, Dan Snyder, is doing one of three things:<strong> (1) carrying on the racist legacy </strong>of George Preston Marshall&rsquo;s ghost,<strong> (2) being tone deaf to fans</strong> who understand how racist it is,<strong> or (3) at first didn&rsquo;t know but now knows and doesn&rsquo;t care, </strong>an example of both #1 and #2.  This is a wake up call to racism deniers:  foul racism still exists. </p>
<p><strong>George Preston Marshall, </strong>the owner who gave the team its name in 1932,was <strong>a leader in the NFL movement that officially banned Blacks, league wide, in 1933, a ban not lifted until 1947</strong>.   Before the Washington team integrated in 1962, Jim Brown, as one sport writer wrote, regularly integrated the Washington end zone.  Marshall had &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; played before &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo; <strong>Marshall died in 1969</strong>, leaving most of his <strong>money to the creation of the Redskins Foundation, stipulating that none of its money be directed to &ldquo;any purpose which supports or employs the principle of racial integration in any form.&rdquo;</strong> [See <strong><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/10/racist-redskins/">The Racist Redskins, </a></strong>a New York Review of Books book review of <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807000744?ie=UTF8&tag=thneyoreofbo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0807000744"><em>Showdown: JFK and the Integration of the Washington Redskins</em></a></strong>, both by Thomas G. Smith] </p>
<p><strong>For half a century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Bellecourt" target="_blank">Clyde Bellecourt</a> has been in the forefront of championing human rights, civil rights, and respect for all Americans</strong>, going beyond Native American rights to the wars in Vietnam, Black civil rights, and police misconduct and brutality.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Bellecourt, co-founder and Director of the <a href="http://www.aimovement.org/">American Indian Movement</a></strong>, directs Peacemaker Center for Indian youth, organized the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media, and is founder and Chairman of the Board of American <strong>Indian OIC, an innovative jobs program that has moved over 14,000 people from welfare to full-time employment. </strong></p>
<p>At the 1991 World Series between our beloved Minnesota Twins and the Atlanta Braves, Mr. Bellecourt challenged the disrespect Atlanta&rsquo;s mascot showed to Native Americans. </p>
<p>The long standing battle over the disrespect and continued use of &ldquo;Redskins&rdquo; has come to a head once again.<strong> &ldquo;Redskin&rdquo; is not a term of endearment but a term of disrespect and justification to use violence against Native Americans</strong>.  The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines &ldquo;redskin&rdquo; as a term that is &ldquo;usually offensive,&rdquo; as other terms like &ldquo;darky,&rdquo; &ldquo;kike,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sambo,&rdquo; &ldquo;dago,&rdquo; and &ldquo;N..ger.&rdquo;  Would current Jewish owner of the Washington franchise change the name to the Washington Kikes? </p>
<p>The Federal Government is now looking into<strong> <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2013/08/us_looks_at_overhauling_how_it.html#incart_river" target="_blank">&quot;overhauling how it recognizes Indian tribes</a></strong><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2013/08/us_looks_at_overhauling_how_it.html#incart_river">.&quot;</a> New rules were proposed in June for dealing with contemporary conflicts between communities and the <a href="http://500nations.com/tribes/Tribes_State-by-State.asp"><strong><u>&nbsp;566 American tribes</u></strong></a> recognized by the Federal government<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>After the NFL integrated, Marshall said he would &ldquo;start signing Negroes when the Harlem Globetrotters start signing whites.&rdquo;  Current owner Snyder said he would &ldquo;never&rdquo; change the name.</p>
<p><strong>All people have feelings and sensitivity about how they are referred to. </strong>Mr. Bellecourt and the Native American nation has indicated it is <strong>never acceptable to disrespect by name or inference</strong> the rich, proud history of America&rsquo;s first nation. </p>
<p>So I say once again:<strong> Mr Bellecourt is right.</strong> Americans of conscience and good will should stand <strong>with</strong> <strong>America&rsquo;s first nation</strong> to bring respect to all who are part of this great nation (Canada doesn&rsquo;t use the term &ldquo;Indian.&rdquo;  Canadians use &ldquo;First Nation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indigenous People&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>I invite Washington team owner, Daniel Snyder and Vikings Black executive Kevin Warren to join by phone on my radio program to talk with Clyde Bellecourt </strong>and answer two questions for him:  (1) isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;never&rdquo; change the name continuing George Preston Marshall&rsquo;s racist legacy?&rdquo;  And (2) how does the policy match what the <strong>great <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/chiefjosep280229.html"><strong>Chief Joseph</strong></a> said:   &ldquo;I only ask of the government to be treated as all other men are treated.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong><a name="c1343d1023" id="c1343d1023"></a>October 23, 2012 Column #43: Minnesota Lynx: We thank you!</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>October 23, 2013
  <blockquote>Pull quote:  &hellip;we have never seen such perfection and dominance as we have when watching these last three seasons of the Minnesota Lynx&hellip;.  </blockquote>
  <p>It is quite clear that the most successful and winningest professional sports team in Minnesota history is now the two-time champion and three-time finalist, The Minnesota Lynx. Our profound congratulations and our deepest appreciation for a quality franchise and a quality team with quality players and a quality owner.</p>
<p>Minnesota has long been desperate for a dynasty. The young ladies of the Minnesota Lynx have created that dynasty. Their march through the WNBA playoffs, 7-0, has only been done one other time in the history of the league.</p>
<p>Much appreciation and congratulations must go to team owner Glenn Taylor. A year ago, October 2012, Minnesotans thanked Glenn Taylor for committing his resources, including his money, to put a winner on the court at Target Center. Think of how impressive The Lynx have been: three final appearances, two championships. The Lynx is one of the most dominant teams in the history of Minnesota professional sports. It is a continuous joy to watch the unselfishness, the togetherness, and the commitment to perfection that will forever be the legacy of the Minnesota Lynx.</p>
<p>During the celebration last Monday, October 14, I saw a lot of tears from a lot of young ladies, as well as tears from those of my age group in appreciation of their accomplishment. Minnesotans supported this dynasty by filling the stands in each and every game, a tribute and show of respect for the success the team brought to Minnesota, as well as their appreciation for an owner who did not turn his back on the goal of winning.</p>
<p>We know it can be done here in Minnesota, and over the last 50 years, we have seen different franchises &mdash; basketball, football, hockey, and baseball &mdash; obtain the success of winning. But we have never seen such perfection and dominance as we have when watching these last three seasons of the Minnesota Lynx, and thus we say, thank you Minnesota Lynx for reminding us of the joy of winning a championship, and, most importantly, reminding us that &ldquo;class&rdquo; is the order of the day in competition.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Lynx are all class: the players and the organization, with a franchise owner who is among the classiest owners to ever grace the Minnesota sports scene. This is not to take anything away from our other franchises. But it is what it is. We look forward to Minnesota men&rsquo;s professional teams to take a page out of the success playbook of the Minnesota Lynx and work to set up their own dynasties.</p>
<p>The future of this franchise is solid. Ownership is committed and players have very productive years in front of them. We hope their success is contagious and provides a lot of inspiration to others.</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems to be difficult for the Minnesota Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press to keep from displaying negative bias in their coverage of these young ladies, as they have not only been less than enthusiastic in their coverage of the success of these young women, but they have not given them the same level of coverage as they do to the male professional sports teams, as the latter fall flat on their faces and continue not to excel.</p>
<p>Discrimination knows no gender or racial boundaries. There are still those who find it difficult to except others as successful and as winners. Nonetheless, after three successful championship seasons, be it the league finals or conference finals, we tip our caps to the success of this dynasty and its owner.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>The Vikings and Sports Authority signed their new stadium agreement on October 3rd, resulting in Vikings ownership prevailing on their stated goals regarding the Lease Agreement, Licensing, Naming Rights, Concession Ownership, and Development Package.</p>
<p>The day before the Vikings-Sports Authority deal was signed, Minnesota Spokesman Recorder ran my column (written 8 days earlier), repeated 18 months of warning:  &ldquo;the Vikings will have to be given everything they want in order to stay.&rdquo;  At signing the next day, Governor Dayton admitted &ldquo;yes:&rdquo;  failure to satisfy Vikings ownership demands would guarantee losing the team: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/video/226376091.html#/226376091/video/1/" target="_blank">&ldquo;we had to make a deal&rdquo;</a>: </p>
<blockquote>...the economics of professional sports are highly questionable all over this country.  .....  We wouldn&rsquo;t have an agreement here and we wouldn&rsquo;t have a team staying here if we hadn&rsquo;t been willing to accede to demand[s] on the team&rsquo;s part from the very beginning of the process.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Experts estimate Vikings can generate at least $100 million more a year.  Will they put it in their pockets or use it to sign /hold better players?  Minnesota ticket holders and taxpayers alike:  is it all worth 10 games a year that most can&rsquo;t attend but can watch only from TV?  Yes, there will be temporary jobs during construction (but many to workers from outside Minnesota).  Ten games/year won&rsquo;t create year-round stadium jobs.  Tickets will cost more and season tickets will require first purchasing a license to make them eligible to purchase a season ticket.  The Vikings had the best of all hands:  five aces, no reshuffle, and no redeal.</p>
<p>Now the Vikings await the successful completion of construction by M. A. Mortenson, with the Sports Facilities Authority, with both shouldering the obligation to pay any cost overruns.  The Vikings out of state ownership juggernaut is in place.  Minnesota gave away its leverage.  Time will tell if this will really be a &ldquo;peoples&rdquo; stadium? <br>
  <br>
When will the Star Tribune, a key component of the people&rsquo;s plaza development, give us a better understanding regarding how this affects Minnesota taxpayers?  When will Star Tribune do a three part series on who won and who lost?  As I have long maintained:  the guys from the East Coast had the best plan going in and the best plan going out, all the way to the bank.  And Minnesota had none.</p>
<p>History has been made.  The Wilfs have their stadium.   They await the 2016 opening.  Then their beloved Vikings will reap profits for the Wilfs Sports Empire.  Empire building is about knowing the terrain, knowing the weaknesses and strengths of whom you deal with, and having a Plan to implement all aspects of the creation of a Great Empire.  Minnesota never replaced its &ldquo;Leave Plan&rdquo; with &ldquo;Stay Plan.&rdquo;  Wilfs did.</p>
<p>Maybe the University of MN and other colleges can develop business courses on &ldquo;How to Create a Sports Empire in the Mid-West by those from the East Coast.&rdquo;  What a historical journey as we watched the creation of the Wilf Sports Empire.  It ranks with the development and planning of the Continental Railroad from the East to the West, with a new 30-year stopover in Minnesota.  Not blinded by vanity, Wilfs knew how to get the job done.  Blinded by vanity, Minnesota gave it away.</p>
<p>I write this because I care about our community and the failure of not only our Black leaders but also white non-profit do-gooder leaders who all failed to stand up for stadium hiring diversity compliance.  Failure in hiring Blacks will now strike the Vikings Stadium as it did the Gophers and Twins stadiums and other large construction projects.  When will any leadership stand up against &ldquo;blacks need not apply&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1341d1009" id="c1341d1009"></a>October 09, 2012 Column #41: </strong><strong>Attack on the Teachers Federation. Why have friends become foes?</strong></p>
<p>Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;
<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards<br>
Featured in the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</p>
<p>October 9, 2013</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The whole world opened to me when I learned to read.&rdquo;</strong><br>
--- Mary McLeod Bethune</p>
<p>For decades, a workable relationship between organized labor and African American leadership existed in Minnesota.  They do not necessarily speak with one voice, but, regarding financial consideration, they do.   But for the last decade, <strong>this relationship has frayed,</strong> not in terms of financial considerations but <strong>in terms of standing up for real education for African American children.</strong></p>
<p>Legendary civil rights activist Nellie Stone Johnson clearly stated:<strong> no education, no job, no housing.</strong> Martin Luther King, Jr. said that although many Blacks were not qualified (lacking education and training), <strong>we are qualifiable through education and training. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bussing was a misguided policy of racism in education:</strong> that Black children could only learn when with White children.  We expect that from Whites but not Blacks.   And so <strong>we were quite shocked to hear the recent attacks on Lynn Norgren, White President of the Teachers Federation by powerful Black leaders and their Black organizations.</strong></p>
<p>For a number of recent months, the Teachers Federation, the Minneapolis Board of Education, and the Superintendent, have met at least 19 times, in extremely intense negotiations. </p>
<p>These negotiation sessions, by law, can be made open to the general public.  It s only when negotiations break down and mediation is asked for that such negotiations can be legally closed, according to legal sources familiar with Minnesota law.</p>
<p>After Federation President Norgren revealed discussions about others in the meeting, especially by <strong>Twin City foundations who talked of the incompetency of African American children &ndash; not because of poor education but because the are incapable of benefiting from a good education -</strong>- she became an enemy of the state.   She became a target of those who embraced statements by African American leadership against the Teachers Federation and organized labor. </p>
<p><strong>For them, only the &ldquo;adult who&rsquo;s&rdquo; on all sides and their organizations matter, and not the &ldquo;student who&rsquo;s&rdquo;</strong> (the children, whether American or immigrant, whether Black or White).  This is rather stunning in light of the Federation&rsquo;s ten point proposal, offered in negotiations, that would improve educational access, opportunities, operations and options for African American children and other children of color, not just whites.</p>
<p><strong>We are hearing that deals have been cut</strong> within different racial communities, including the African American community, but for adults, not children.  This questions the presence and effectiveness of pubic education.</p>
<p>Community leadership conspiring to help themselves <strong>will hurt the educational opportunity of our children by  denying them many opportunities to move forward with the general masses.</strong> Efforts must be made to assure African American parents and their African American children, that they are still valued and important , that their future is important to all who seriously support the African American child.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.minnpost.com/sites/default/files/attachments/moving-beyond-the-status-quo-5-13-13.pdf" target="_blank">As the Federation has stated, </a>&ldquo;the opportunity gap [for Black children] is a problem that has its roots in the racism, classism and white privilege of our city. We know that we must accompany social and economic reforms with education change in order to solve it.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not about building a wall.  It is about tearing down walls.  <strong>This is about supporting the need for excellence in education, employment and housing on behalf of African American children and their parents.</strong> Expect nothing less from those who say they stand in defense of the African American child and their communities.<br>

<p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>October 2, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Pull quote:  </strong>Will the Wilfs stay or look toward the golden West?</p>
<p>On Monday, Sept 23, Minnesota media reported, almost breathlessly, New Jersey Judge Wilson&rsquo;s verdict, using headlines with a different slant than coverage in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Newark Star Ledger: <strong><a href="mailto:http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/224960792.html%3Fpage=all%26prepage=1%26c=y%23continue">Judge announces damages of $84.5 million against Wilfs in long-running lawsuit</a></strong>.<br>
  Minneapolis Star Tribune: <strong><a href="mailto:http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/224960792.html%3Fpage=all%26prepage=1%26c=y%23continue">Wilfs fined $84.5 million in New Jersey real estate fraud case</a></strong>.<br>
  Attorney fees of $16 million <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/224960792.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y#continue" target="_blank">could push it over $100 million.</a></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis reporting leaves out three key points. </strong><br>
  (1) The Wilf position: <strong>How little, if anything, those suing the Wilfs contributed to their joint enterprise</strong> (hence Wilf actions and subsequent lawsuit). <br>
  (2) The bogus concern: Can the Wilf&rsquo;s pay? <strong>Bogus because the legislation allows stadium, team, and NFL revenue sources to pay the Vikings share, not the Wilfs personally</strong><br>
  (3) Number two is because of <strong>Minnesota arrogance</strong>, as seen in Ted Mondale&rsquo;s 2011 statement that is the essence of how the governor, legislature, and sports authority have acted.  Mondale said that <strong>&ldquo;a stadium deal is not complicated.&rdquo; The Wilfs not only recognize the complexity of the deal, they actually understand contracts and finances and are better negotiators.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve written on this for a decade.</strong> But those in both government and at the Vikings have not listened, which is why they are at this cross roads, with the Wilfs in the stadium driver&rsquo;s seat. <strong>Don&rsquo;t force them into an either/or decision: get the parking space they want or park in L.A.</strong></p>
<p>Within a half hour of the decision in New Jersey, the Wilfs&rsquo; attorney conducted a conference call with Minnesota press. Was the attorney correct when he said they are prepared to &ldquo;move forward,&rdquo; are &ldquo;committed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;look forward&rdquo; to a new stadium for kick off 2016? Or are these &ldquo;must say&rdquo; Madison Avenue-type PR clich&eacute;s, saying all the right things but maybe for all the wrong reasons as they study <strong>the road map options: stay, sell or drive to L.A.?</strong></p>
<p>According to the stadium schedule, by the time this column is printed (we submit eight days prior to publication), the Wilfs will have signed a lease agreement, the state will have found purchasers for the $348 million in bonds it issues <strong>(we have no idea what the city will do regarding its $150 million obligation</strong>), and the Vikings will be back on track for their Fall 2016 opening.  We are not convinced it will have happened. If it does, the state has already caved.<strong> [Editor's question, 9-4-13:</strong> as Star Tribune, October 3, 2013, reports the  deal signed October 3, 2013:, <strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/226373341.html?page=all&prepage=2&c=y#continue" target="_blank">allowing the state to issue $498 million in bonds to finance the public portion of the project</a></strong>,<strong> does this mean the State is covering the City's portion? And if so, what was in the deal?</strong>]</p>
<p>To make the sale of these bonds attractive, purchasers need a permanent tenant, which is needed to negotiate seat licenses and other revenue generation considerations that will pay the Vikings stadium half. So, is this a back-door strategy, as believed by NFL insiders, to humiliate the Wilfs to the point where they will sell to a local buyer,<strong> or is this an exercise to explain why the Vikings will have to be given everything they want in order to stay?</strong></p>
<p>Will the Wilfs stay or look toward the golden West? Nothing suggests the Wilfs want out of pro football. Nothing suggests that the gods/owners of the NFL would force the Wilfs to sell.</p>
<p>Will the Minnesota Vikings faithful enjoy their beloved Vikings for another 50 years in the people&rsquo;s stadium, or will Minnesota foolishness, arrogance and pettiness result in<strong> the &ldquo;move&rdquo; scenario or give them what they want scenario?</strong></p>
<p>We wrote in an earlier column of an under current of anti-semitism directed toward the Wilf family. The Wilf family survived the Holocaust. I&rsquo;m sure Zigi Wilf does not want to feel anti-semitism is widely in place in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Minneapolis media needs to do a better job of reporting actual facts and issues in the Wilf&rsquo;s New Jersey lawsuit. The Wilfs may very well be able to demonstrate to the appeals court in New Jersey who had a personal bias against the Wilf family, given their <a href="given their complex web of holdings" target="_blank"><strong>complex web of holdings</strong></a>.</p>
