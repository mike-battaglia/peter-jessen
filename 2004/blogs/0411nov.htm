<p><strong>11-28-04,#8. NAACP Saga Continues: Kweisi Mfume Ousted. Will hope return?</strong> 
<p>Rumors continue to swirl about the NAACP Headquarters offices in Baltimore, 
  MD at the sudden departure of Kweisi Mfume as President of the NAACP. The generalized 
  statement of plausibility is that it is because Kweisi Mfume has not been an 
  effective executive, in that he has not generated an increase in membership 
  (which we can attest to as he presided over our being expelled, so that is one 
  that was dropped from the rolls) and because he did not increase the revenues 
  (and certainly expending monies on projects like our expulsion takes money away 
  from real issues). The vote to terminate was 4-2 by vote of the Executive Committee. 
  As the By-Laws of the NAACP allow for the National Executive Board to terminate 
  for cause, and as this was done swiftly last Wednesday, with the staff being 
  told Friday, we suspect that there is more to this than just a lack of increase 
  in membership and revenue. Had there been accounting irregularities as in Minneapolis, 
  we would have expected a unanimous vote. As it was 4-2 we suspect it was personal 
  behaviors not in keeping with the values and practices of this potentially great 
  civil rights organization. We have tried to maintain a positive tone with the 
  NAACP. But when a national civil rights organization&#8217;s President allows 
  a civil rights activist be expelled for what was written in his book, things 
  are amiss, other things are distracting, and it is a sign that the organization 
  is off kilter, off track. We have drawn attention to our concerns in our paper 
  on the NAACP (<a href="../../solutionpapers/12eyeoffprize.htm">NAACP 
  Takes Eye of Prize</a>posted July 21, 2003), and columns on our Minneapolis.com 
  web page. We believe as Isaiah, that &#8220;the beginning of wisdom is to call 
  things by their right name.&#8221; This we have done. We are emboldened to hope 
  that the NAACP will now do so as well and will now return to its civil right 
  purpose and concentrate not on executive&#8217;s personal things and junkets 
  to African plantations run by Black dictators, but pay attention to the plantations 
  of our inner cities in which Whites continue to act as if we are different and 
  can&#8217;t make it by ourselves, as they do all they can to make that a self 
  fulfilling prophecy. We pray that the NAACP will now return to its roots and 
  once again lead the way in dealing effectively with the problems still to be 
  solved for the ancestors of African slaves in America in terms of education, 
  jobs, housing, health care, public safety, and the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a>, posted August 16,2003. We commend 
  to the NAACP our <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> and recommend that the NAACP consider 
  using them to implement our proposed <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Key Solutions</a> nation wide, which would rekindle in us the hope 
  that the NAACP will actually be on the way to being restored and that it will 
  no longer have its eyes diverted from our deserved and earned Prize of Freedom 
  so we can finish our <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm">Unfinished 
  Dream</a>.

<p><strong>11-27-04/#7: NAACP: no annual dinner for first time in 70 years. Do 
  elections mean recycle, reform, or dissolve?</strong> 
<p>For the first time in 70 years, the NAACP held no annual Freedom Day Banquet. 
  In November of 2000, two thousand turned out to hear Nelson Mandela. Local corporations 
  gave him $100,000 for his museum on Robbins Island where he was incarcerated 
  for 28 years. Our local branch took in $87,000. Fast forward to November 2000: 
  “The Minneaolis Story, through My eyes” was published warning of trouble ahead, 
  of the decline and demise, in Chapter 14. For that act of truth telling our 
  supporters were disenfranchised and I was expelled. Now fast forward again to 
  November 2004: no annual banquet. No money in the treasury. Branch in receivership.

<p>What does the local branch have to show for itself in 
  November 2004? New elections were held. But will the branch recycle the 
  old style with new people, reform the old for the prizes of progress in 
  access and opportunity for African Americans in Minneapolis in the 21st 
  century, or be dissolved by national due to being irrelevant? </p>
<p>With 62 voting in the elections of November 20th out of 
  a membership of 267, are the results valid? And with a membership of 267 
  out of a Black population of 80,000, is the NAACP relevant to the Black 
  people of the community or just to those participating in a defacto patronage 
  system? Will they seek to have those improperly expelled reinstated or 
  pursue old business of getting paid to collect monies for activities that 
  essentially stay within the offices and not in the community? Will the 
  new leadership be bold reformers or solid supporters of the status quo? 
  Will the new leadership go boldly where the NAACP has not gone for a long 
  time, or be dissolved with a whimper? Will it seek to achieve genuine 
  self-supporting independence or sit around waiting for some government 
  agency or corporation to give it funds to keep a gloss on the nameplate 
  to assuage their consciences, but which essentially achieves nothing for 
  the community? posted 12:05 p.m.
