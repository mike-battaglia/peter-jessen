<p align="left"><strong>1/29/Blog2005/#7 Hail Purple: Finding the Common Ground 
  Between &#8220;Reds&#8221; and &#8220;Blues&#8221; to work against the common 
  denominator of opposition to Jack Johnson, Joe Louis, Nellie Stone Johnson, 
  &amp; Condoleezza Rice: racism against &#8220;bad Blacks&#8221; (Rs or Ds). 
  Unintended consequence: making her job easier and more effective.</strong> 
<p>We have been treated to tremendous programs on TV dealing with racism these 
  past two weeks on <strong>three great Blacks: Jack Johnson Joe Louis on PBS, 
  and Condoleezza Rice everywhere.</strong> 
<p>We prefer the color Purple to the colors Red state. Blue state. How about Purple 
  state? We in Minnesota understand purple, the color of our beloved Vikings and 
  the color you get when you mix red and blue. In our book and on this web site, 
  we continue to advocate finding common ground (Chapters 5 and 17). Even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/nyregion/25clinton.html?hp&ex=1106715600&en=de487ff96cb3843b&ei=5094&partner=homepage" target="_blank">Hilary 
  Clinton</a> urged it last week in terms of abortion. Why? Because, 
  first of all, we are all Americans and we have areas we agree on: life, liberty 
  and the pursuit of happiness, and the education, jobs and housing needed to 
  achieve those in general and the civil rights and human rights in particular 
  that should surround them. Where we disagree is how to achieve good education, 
  good jobs, and good housing. One of the big road blocks is racism. It drips 
  from every page in my book. It is acknowledged but, like weather, becomes something 
  people talk about but do little about. There are several people discussed in 
  this post, all Black, who did/have done/are doing things to combat racism in 
  order to open up equal access and equal opportunit for all: <strong>Jack Johnson, 
  Joe Louis, and Condoleeza Rice.</strong> 
<p>This is important to remember as we approach February as Black History Month, 
  urging everyone, Black and White, to stop the racism, and to remember Dr. King&#8217;s 
  counsel to go on &#8220;character&#8221; not &#8220;color&#8221;. And if color 
  must enter in, &#8220;Go Purple!&#8221;, not red or blue. My book is about the 
  racism in education, jobs, housing, government, etc. Now we see <strong>blatant 
  racism in the treatment of Dr. Rice. I may not agree with everything she stands 
  for but I don&#8217;t agree that anyone should receive the racist treatment 
  she has been subjected to, </strong>although, given the racism towards Blacks 
  in education, jobs, and housing in Minneapolis, it is not a surprise. But why 
  do they think we are so dumb we Blacks can&#8217;t see it? 
<p>In 1908, Jack Johnson became the first Black Heavyweight Champion. Whites were 
  furious, turned violent, and went on destructive rampages, and then relentlessly 
  pursued a &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; strategy to find a White fighter to 
  beat Johnson. The finally achieved their goal in 1914. <br>
  Then came the between the war years. Hitler. Fascist socialism. Fascist socialistic 
  totalitarianism. A threat to Western Civilization. White supremacy. German supremacy. 
  <strong>The West needed a champion. A Great Democratic Hope</strong>. In one 
  of the more ironic twists of history, <strong>the new hope was a Black man, 
  Joe Louis.</strong> The hopes of the White West rested on the shoulders of ths 
  24 year old Black man. Recall that the German Max Schmeling had knocked out 
  Louis in the 12th round of a fight in 1936. In 1937, Louis won the heavyweight 
  championship. Schmelilng wanted it. Early in &#8216;38, as the world teetered on the 
  brink of World War II, <strong>the Louis-Schmeling rematch had become a metaphor 
  of that coming war. When Louis met with FDR prior to the fight, FDR gripped 
  Louis&#8217;s arm and said, &quot;Joe, we&#8217;re depending on those muscles for America.&quot;</strong> 
<p>Now Western Civilization is depending on another black, Dr. Condoleeza Rice. 
  This assumes the new democracies will be true &quot;majority rule, minority 
  protected&quot; democracies and not some perverted form such as &#8220;tyranny 
  of the majority.&#8221; And as Western Civilization is at stake, it is all the 
  more important that the &quot;majority rules, minorities are protected&quot; 
  be the case. For those who don&#8217;t think Western Civilization is at stake, read 
  <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/009366.php">this</a> 
  at Minneapolis based, Time Magazine Blog of the year. 
<p>Jesse Owens, another great Black athlete, knocked the wind out of Hitler&#8217;s 
  racial supremacy myth by winning four Olympic Gold Medals, in Berlin, with Hitler 
  watching. Now, on June 22, 1938, the crowd expected a long fight. All the world 
  was listening. But unlike the white delerium for a Black man&#8217;s loss, with 
  Jack Johnson, their sense of safety and freedom was on the line. Hitler&#8217;s 
  Arayan Master fighter was in the ring. <strong>What American David could stand 
  up to this German Goliath? A Black man: Joe Louis.</strong> And now the Whites 
  cheered for this Black man&#8217;s victory for it would be their vitory too. 
  Joe had learned from his first meeting with Schmeling. He knew how important 
  this was. The fight was the largest radio audience of any programming before 
  and not again until the war. 
<p>Louis TKOed Schmeling in the first round. The Great Black Hope triumphed. 
<p>America went crazy. Everyone was a Joe Louis fan that night. But when Joe joined 
  the Army for World War II, he was put into a segregated unit. And then later 
  Civil rights critized him. Racism works everywhere: he wasn&#8217;t &quot;the right 
  kind&quot; of Negro. for them. Dr. Rice gets that now. And many wonder why Blacks 
  have lost the civil rights momentum. It is because too many have put party over 
  people. 
<p>And now we see the geopolitical version of Jack Johnson and Joe Louis in Condoleezza 
  Rice. We are again at war, a Global War Agaisnt Terrorism, and again need champions 
  of democracy to free enslaved peoples. Instead of Hitler&#8217;s Nazi White 
  supremacy we have radical Islam&#8217;s doctrine of Islamic supremacy and its 
  drive to turn the world into an Islamic theocracy. 
<p>In the 19th century there was a popular phrase, &#8220;the only good injun 
  is a dead injun.&#8221; The Democrats seem to have a 21st century version of 
  that: the only good Black is a Democrat. Condoleezza Rice was a little girl 
  in Birmingham when four other little girls were killed in the infamous bomb 
  blast. Condi went on to better herself. She learned languages, including Russian. 
  She became an accomplished concert pianist. She served as the Provost of Stanford 
  University, the &#8220;Harvard of the West Coast.&#8221; And now she is the 
  first Black woman to become Secretary of State. How does the &#8220;Black party&#8221; 
  of Democrats celebrate? By playing the role of mosquitoes swarming her with 
  the stings of many false charges, projecting their own role as liars on her, 
  as they approachedher with of context, ideologically distorted, using her to 
  launch empirically groundless attacks on what they think are attacks on the 
  President and the Republicans. In reality they are attacks on the United States. 
<p>Sixty years ago, <strong>the Nazi Death Camps</strong> of Auschwitz and Dachau 
  were liberated. The world vowed to never forget. <strong>The world vowed &#8220;Never 
  again!&#8221;</strong> In Iraq many mass graves have been found, bearing witness 
  to the fact that Iraq was a place where it was happening again. Are these not 
  the equivalent of Auschwitz and Dachau? Have we forgotten? Can the bitterness 
  of electoral defeat be so strong that Democrats wish Saddam was still filling 
  mass graves rather than admit freeing 20 million people is a good thing? The 
  relatives of the hundreds of thousands killed by Saddam already know that the 
  main weapon of mass destruction was caught hiding in a hole. Do we no longer 
  care about the modern Auschwitzes and Dachaus of Saddam, the Sudan and Dufur 
  and the sub-Sahara genocide going on as we debate? How did we get to this point? 
<p>Democrats used to fight for the Voting Rights Act. How is it that that has 
  now become a &#8220;sacred&#8221; relic of the Democratic Party for Blacks to 
  vote for them but can&#8217;t stand up for either Blacks who don&#8217;t vote 
  for them nor for the victory enabling Iraqis to vote democratically for the 
  first time in their 5,000 year history, not to mention the voting done in Afghanitan 
  and the voting in the area of the Middle East referred to as the future country 
  of Palestine? 
<p>Is voting a universal ideal or only for those who vote for Democrats? If it 
  is for Democrats then, by all means, bring the troops home and let the rest 
  of the world that lives in chains continue, so that we put off worrying about 
  it until later when Iran takes over the Middle Easter oil fields or North Korea 
  sends us its nuclear messages. 
<p>So how was Condoleeza Rice treated? The Democrats wanted a great White hope, 
  not a Black woman who wasn&#8217;t a Democrat. Ted Kennedy, whose treatment 
  of women makes Bill Clinton look like a choir boy, uttered his proposterousnesses, 
  backed by our own so-called liberal scaredycat, Democrat Senator Mark Dayton, 
  and, of course, backed by former Ku Klux Klansman Democratic Senator Byrd from 
  West Virginia, who couldn&#8217;t hurl his false charges at her fast enough. 
  As one <a href="http://www.steynonline.com" target="_blank">commentator</a> 
  put it &#8220;the sight of an old Klansman blocking a little colored girl from 
  Birmingham from getting into her office contributed to the general retro vibe 
  that hangs around the Democratic Party these days.&#8221; 
<p>They subjected her to the most questions asked any nominee in history. They 
  say it wasn&#8217;t racist. I say it was. I don&#8217;t agree with all Dr. Rice 
  says. But I also don&#8217;t agree on the continued practice of the Democratic 
  party&#8217;s racism (as inner city Blacks are continually &#8220;kept in their 
  place&#8221; in terms of education, jobs, and housing, all controlled in the 
  inner cities by Democrats, with as special concern for the emergency regarding 
  young Black inner city males. 
<p>Why the Democrats liberal racist response (1968 Kerner Commission Report: Blacks 
  aren&#8217;t like others and can&#8217;t make it on their own and thus must 
  be wards of the state? 
<p> And why the same racist response by conservatieves (1998 &quot;Bel Curve: 
  Blacks are too dumb to make it on their own and must be wards of the state. 
<p>Both are racist. This is why , when asked, I say I am a &quot;Nellie Stone 
  Johnson Democrat (see book, Interlude 3). 
<p>Nellie Stone Johnson, Black woman civil rights activist extraordinaire, leader 
  of the Farm Labor Party and co-founder with Hubert Humphrey of the Democrat 
  Farm Labor Party in Minnesota, would have been proud of Condaleeza Rice. She 
  may have disagreed on some issues with her (just as she did with Paul Wellstone), 
  but she would have gloried in what Condoleeza has made of herself and held her 
  up as a model to young Black women. 
<p>It is time Blacks took a closer look at the party that looks more and more 
  like a suicide cult. Nellie experienced this racism herself. For example, she 
  was forced off the Democratic National Committee by the feminists who wanted 
  half the positions filled by women, but only White women. As Nellie put it, 
  they &#8220;would push quotas for women, but not for minorities,&#8221; they 
  wanted &#8220;the high echelon of the white middle class, not for anybody with 
  a brown skin.&#8221; 
<p>Nellie learned, as did Martin Luther King, that the Mason Dixon Line was actually 
  as far north as the Canadian Border. As Nellie said, &#8220;the white women 
  there across the board-you can&#8217;t lay this all on the white Southerners&#8212;felt 
  they could lord their whiteness over everyone.&#8221; At the DNC, she said, 
  &#8220;there was so much racism in the women&#8217;s caucus. The feminists had 
  a women&#8217;s department that didn&#8217;t have any women of color.&#8221; 
  Even Paul Wellstone, who she liked, treated her this way because he did what 
  the White women wanted (as he sought support for his upcoming first senatorial 
  race that she didn&#8217;t know he was planning). Wellstone ran against her 
  in a DNC race &#8220;just to knock me off.&#8221; And later, &quot;Jackie Cherryhomes&#8230;and 
  Linda Higgins&#8221; did the same and ran Bea Underwood against Nellie. As Nellie 
  explained it, they said she was too old even as they ignored &#8220;older white 
  women with comparable jobs&#8221; (pp. 198-203 of her autobiography, &#8220;The 
  Life of an Activist.&#8221; Natalie Johnson-Lee is getting the same treatment 
  from the DFL. 
<p>So Condi, congratulations. Read my book and its followup volume coming out 
  next month and you&#8217;ll see where we have our common ground and then we 
  can work on how our different approaches might work together to help address 
  the emergency of the young Black males of our inner cities. 
<p>And in the meantime, be sure to send the Democrats a thank you note. They often 
  crippled the work of Colin Powell by constantly saying he was the only sane, 
  rational person in the Bush administration, and they continually believed at 
  some point he would resign and expose the whole &#8220;Bush house of cards,&#8221; 
  causing many foreign leaders to think we were not serious at the UN, for if 
  we were he would resign. And now that he has resigned, the left has gone after 
  him too as seen in this <a href="http://harpers.org/ColinJob.html" target="_blank">cartoon 
  of Colin Powell by Harper&#8217;s Magazine</a><strong>,</strong> posted 1-25-05, 
  headed &quot;Colin Powell re-entering the job market,&quot; carrying a sign 
  that says, &quot;Will supress all sense of moral decency and lick corporate 
  ass crack for money.&quot; Apparently they are intent on punishing him for not 
  being the turn coat they wanted him to be. 
<p>Just as the protestors caused the Vietnam war to drag on, they also gave rise 
  to the hopes of the terrorists in Iraq that we will leave. The Democrats made 
  sure, their unintended consequence, that the world knows the US, based on her 
  responses, eally does have one policy, democracy, and that delays under false 
  hopes of a Democratic White Horse are just that, false, and that all will be 
  better off getting with the freedom and liberation program.<br>

<p><strong>1/29/2005/#6: Does the President speak for the inner city too? Who 
  does the DFL speak for?</strong> 
<p>As civil rights activist/DFL founder Nellie Stone Johnson said (see our book, 
  Interlude 3), &#8220;no education, no jobs, no housing.&#8221; In other words, 
  without an education good jobs are scarce and without a job good housing is 
  scarce. In our book, and on this web site, we talk about seeking common ground 
  to work together to close the gaps in the &#8220;Big 3&#8221; of Education (Chapters 
  7 &amp; 10), Jobs (Chapter 9), and Housing (Chapter 8), and we have urged working 
  together applying the Golden Rule (Chapter 5). We talk about the goal of equal 
  access and equal opportunity, and we talk about the political and social leadership 
  (Democrat/Republican/Independent and Liberal/Conservative/Radical/Libertarian) 
  that, as we outline in chapter after chapter of our book, have either worked 
  to keep Blacks &#8220;in their place,&#8221; sighed with despair and accepted 
  the status quo, or talked the walk of civil rights (especially the DFL, NAACP 
  and the Urban League) but instead walked the talk of status quo, leading to 
  the unjust, unfair, and immoral gaps in the inner cities between Blacks and 
  Whites in the areas of education, jobs, housing, and, most especially, as these 
  relate to helping cause the emergency of young Black inner city males. 
<p>These are under the control of the DFL. And the Rs have stood by and let them. 
<p>Now that President Bush has been re-elected will he be the President of us 
  all? 
<p>As a web site and book, we havee not shied away from either the bad news about 
  race (Book Interludes 2 and 10) or the good news on race (Book Interludes 5 
  and 7). In his press conference of January 26, President Bush said &#8220;civil 
  rights is education and ownership&#8221; of homes. We want to know who is for 
  us. New Senate Minority Leader, Democrat Harry Reid said we are in danger of 
  a depression with &#8220;soup lines&#8221; and Senator Hilary Clinton said our 
  economy is on the verge of &#8220;collapse.&#8221; Is this the Democrats way 
  of again ignoring the plight of the inner city and echoing the Republican Herbert 
  Hoover who told FDR on the way to FDR inauguration, &#8220;there is nothing 
  that can be done&#8221;? 
<p>We stand for a strong two party system. But we know that the three big areas 
  causing us problems in the inner city are controlled by Democrats (education, 
  jobs in terms of city compliance, and housing). We want our readers to know 
  that the President has established some common ground goals we agree with as 
  he expressed them in his inaugural address, and we would like to know where 
  Democrats stand on them: 
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must 
    always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon 
    all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and 
    the baggage of bigotry at the same time.&quot;<br>
    Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, 
    because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of 
    democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the 
    ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.</p>
  <p>&quot;In America&#8217;s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by 
    service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also remember and support these words of Abraham Lincoln, spoken in Cleveland, 
  Ohio on February 15, 1861: <br>
  &quot;As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses 
  my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, 
  is no democracy.&quot; 
<p>How can anyone, Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or Independent, liberal, 
  conservative or green, not celebrate and rejoice not only that more people are 
  moving towards governing themselves in freedom, but that in the regions of Afghanitistan 
  and in the Middle East, they are beginning to recognize that the U.S. is making 
  sacrifices to help Muslims govern themselves in freedom. In 1775, there were 
  no democracies in the word. After 1776, there was one. Today there are 117, 
  61% of the world&#8217;s governments, which is twice what it was 30 years ago. 
  How can any protest this? 
<p>All we ask at this web site is that the concept of freedom be extended to the 
  inner cities of America in terms of education, jobs, and houosing. We know how 
  to achieve these noble ideals. We continue to wonder why so many leaders of 
  the Minneapolis government, educational, civil rights, and journalism communities, 
  both White and Black, continue to ignore these unjust and unfair gaps in education, 
  jobs and housing that are the result of their political party of choice, and 
  why they accept this because &#8220;nothing can be done,&#8221; which they can 
  only say by ignoring the &#8220;what can be done&#8221; solutions we have placed 
  before them in our book (Chapters 5 and 17) and on this web site as we advocate 
  that they, together, use <strong>The Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</strong> 
  to implement <strong>The Seven Key Solutions</strong>, using The Golden Rule 
  (Chapter 5) to guide the process.<br>

<p><strong><a name="0505b0129"></a>1/29/2005#5: Open Letter to the Strib to follow the lead of the LA 
  Times: have an &#8220;Outside the Tent&#8221; column (or: Other tents and sub-tents) 
  to discuss a diverse range of ideas for solving the problems left unsolved by 
  keeping the status quo. </strong> 
<p>Because of the artful &quot;cut and thrust&quot; of the duel between the Minneapolis 
  Star Tribune and us, and because of our belief that such give and take will 
  benefit all, why not experiment with the &quot;Outside the Tent&quot; column 
  being tried by the L.A. times (started in January)? The L.A. Times uses the 
  term &#8220;Outside the Tent.&#8221; We find that dismissive, as if there is 
  THE way, the tent&#8217;s way, and that those outside the tent must, by definition, 
  have their heads in the sand. 
<p>Reality is multiple. So why not use &quot;Other tents and sub-tents&quot; to 
  acknowledge not only other realities but different ways to get to the same desired 
  reality within each one?<br>
  Such a column would give others a chance to express what they believe and why, 
  regardless of whether their interpretations are based on the secular, the transcendent, 
  or both, and bear witness to the fact that there is ore common ground thn not. 
  We know there will be social change. Society is dynamic, not static. Yet most 
  of the problems stem from those trying to freeze the status quo rather than 
  let the status quo breathe and expand, contract, and transform as needed. And 
  we know we all have our social roles as does each organization, agency, and 
  elected official. 
<p>Most of us want the same things (as we express in chapters 5 and 17 of our 
  book). Where we differ is how to achieve them. My bet is that we don&#8217;t 
  really have separate tents or just one tent surrounded by sand. My belief is 
  that we have one tent, the United States of America, and that inside this tent 
  are many sub-tents, some trying to become the only tent and others trying to 
  create paths to the other tents in order to work on ways to work together, even 
  if separately, under the same national tent. I urge the Star Tribune to try 
  this. 
<p>We would further urge an approach that makes more sense to us than the traditional 
  left-right or liberal-conservative divide. Borrowing from the work of sociologist 
  Peter Berger, we advocated in our book&#8217;s conclusion, p. 322, that such 
  label confusion be done away with and instead recognize that too many on both 
  &#8220;sides&#8221; want their way to be THE way, and attempt to thus MAKE it 
  so. Thus we opted against the <strong>historically <em>specific</em> conservative 
  approach</strong> (far left and far right, who want to either create a utopian 
  future that can&#8217;t exist or resurrect a golden past than never existed, and conserve 
  it, i.e., FREEZE it in place. This has resulted in a freeze of poor eduation, 
  poor jobs, and poor housing for inner city residents. 
<p>This is why we opted for the more dynamic <strong>historically <em>non-specific</em> 
  conservative</strong> approach, as we see this as <strong>a</strong> &quot;way 
  out&quot; of the often so-confused-they-mean-nothing-splits of right/left and 
  liberal/conservative divide. As change happens, and as we all have our place 
  in that change, doesn&#8217;t it make more sense to &#8220;make haste slowly&#8221; 
  with social policy as social change is the only constant? Social roles rule, 
  and there needs to be a willingness to change course depending on whether the 
  unintended consequence(s) that accompany any policy are found to help achieve 
  or prevent a policy&#8217;s goal. It is this lack of a willingness to change 
  that keeps our inner cities mired in poverty and its residents on the short 
  end of the stick in terms of education, jobs, and housing. 
<p>We urge the Star Tribune to invite those outside their tent to comment and 
  to stir up a positive conversation to bring more ideas and solutions to the 
  table. Or is the Star Tribune only for the status quo, as their &#8220;side&#8221; 
  is in charge in city government, or, if change must be made, does favor only 
  the changes that favor the ideologies favored by their editorial board and which 
  make sure that Blacks are kept &quot;in their place?<br>

<p><strong>1/29/2005,#4 Spike Moss: Though dismissed, honored. We need more, not 
  fewer of the likes of Moss. We can do no less for our youth or we will have 
  no future.</strong> 
<p>Allthough it still remains unclear why City, Inc. terminated the position Spike 
  Moss has held for 20 years, in light of the needs in our community, it was made 
  clear at the January 21, 2005 Roast of Spike that even as one more Black organzation 
  lets down the community, those in attendance individuals still showed that they 
  know what needs to be done: have more men like Spike Moss at work in our community. 
  Read more details in the <a href="http://www.mplsobserver.com/pages/moss.htm" target="_blank"> 
  Minneapolis Observer</a>. 
<p>Spike Moss was and is <strong>as well-known for </strong><strong>&#8220;demanding 
  accountability from black people as he is for railing against white racism.&#8221;</strong> 
  Minneapolis and its institutions, both White and Black, are found wanting. Whites 
  have once again succeeded in putting another Black Man in his place with the 
  backing of Blacks. We hope that better minds and calmer heads find a place for 
  where Spike can work to better our community. Let&#8217;s listen to what others 
  said and then hear Spike&#8217;s clarion call: 
<p> <strong>Don Shelby:</strong> &#8220;Don&#8217;t let Spike Moss&#8217;s voice 
  fall silent.&#8221; 
<p><strong>Mahmoud El-Kati: </strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to roast Spike 
  but to toast him.&#8221; &#8220;To hail and salute him for living a committed 
  life.&#8221; &#8220;he committed himself to the question of social justice, 
  the question of freedom, equality, and dignity for African people in America. 
  That&#8217;s how I see Spike. That&#8217;s what I call the definition of a person: 
  when you can compare what they say [to] what they do. And as far as I can tell, 
  he&#8217;s doing what he said he would do. That&#8217;s a rare thing for most 
  of us.&#8221; &#8220;He is a positive byproduct of the civil rights struggle, 
  a good example of what it means to love one&#8217;s people-hood. In this case 
  we&#8217;re talking about the peculiar and beautiful humanity of black people.&#8221; 
<p><strong>Clyde Bellecourt,</strong> speaking by phone from Canada: &#8220;a 
  great warrior.&#8221; 
<p><strong>Minneapolis Observer:</strong> &#8220;Moss long has been the worst 
  nightmare of mayors and police chiefs in Minneapolis, all of whom knew that 
  when they caught hell from him, they indeed were catching hell from black Minneapolis.&#8221; 
<p><strong>Natalie Johnson-Lee:</strong> &#8220;&#8220;Spike Moss has sought out 
  and called out injustice wherever he sees it, and in many cases, wherever it 
  attempts to hide. He continues to publicly respond to issues of concern to the 
  African American community. While some would have his voice silenced, there 
  are many who are grateful for his compelling, provocative, and sometimes controversial 
  advocacy on our behalf. We may not always heed the call, but we can say that 
  he is a strong vanguard who has made it his personal agenda to make us aware, 
  keep us informed, and urge us into action, and for this we are appreciative 
  and grateful.&#8221; 
<p><strong>Spike Moss:</strong> &#8220;I hate to leave at a time when our kids 
  are so disrespectful, when they talk to their parents any kind of way. I can&#8217;t 
  imagine, when I was young, calling my mother a bitch or a &#8216;ho&#8217;.&#8221; 
  Our kids today have more drugs than they do college degrees. They have more 
  guns than they do pencils. Murder has become common. And it has to stop. This 
  is our community. And we have to save it.&#8221; 
<p>And so once again Spike notes the work to be done and laments he has to leave 
  his job during what the Minneapolis Observer called &#8220;a time of unprecedented 
  crisis in the community.&#8221; And once again the White community turns its 
  back and yet once more a so-called Black organization fails in its task. As 
  long as our Black organizations don&#8217;t raise a ruckus and get rid of those 
  who do, why would the good White Democrats do anything? 
<p>Our future is our youth. This is why this web site, our weekly columns, 
  and our book continue to urge addressing <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">the 
  emergency state of youth</a><strong> </strong>of our community. We still need 
  to create equal access and equal opportunity by closing the gaps in education, 
  jobs, and housing, and address them by following The Golden Rule (Chapter 5), 
  using <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The Minneapolis

<p><strong>1/17/2005 #3, Honoring Dr. King, Preparing for Black History Month 
  in February.</strong> 
<p> These are the three key words on the Stanford University’s Martin Luther King, 
  Jr. Papers Project web site: 
<ul>
  <strong>Social Justice&#8212;Transformation&#8212;Reconcililation</strong> 
</ul>
<p> The project’s web site is at <a href=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King target="_blank">http://www.stanford.edu/group/King</a> 
  where you can hear his voice, read his papers, learn and understand the history 
  of the struggle for social justice, transformation, and reconciliation. As Dr. 
  King said on April 4, 1967: 
<ul>
  "If we make the right choice, we will be able to transform the jangling discords 
  of our world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. If we make the right 
  choice, will be able to speed up the day, all over America and all over the 
  world, when justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty 
  stream." 
</ul>
<p> We have made the choice to maintain this web site in order to <strong> (1) </strong> 
  tell the continuing story of how Minneapolis like the last outpost of the great 
  experiment to show other cities how to master the harmful political and economic 
  machinery for keeping minorities “in their place” in terms of education, jobs, 
  housing, and the war on young Black men, and to <strong> (2) </strong> provide practical 
  suggestions/outlines/recipes for how to achieve these goals of social justice, 
  transformation, and reconciliation. 
<p> We have our suggestions/outlines/recipies in our book, <strong> The Minneapolis 
  Story, Through My Eyes</strong> (order on our web site at www.TheMinneapolisStory.com) 
  and through our materials on this web site. Our “second volume” will be ready 
  for purchase in February. It will be called “Leave No Minorities Behind: Fulfilling 
  the Inner City Dream: The Experience of Bringing Alternatives to Stop the White 
  and Black Forces of Reversal and Nullification.” We have summarized our approach 
  of how to bring about social justice, transformation and reconciliation in education, 
  jobs, housing, and public safety in our papers on the State of Emergency for 
  Black Youth as we urged the following of The Golden Rule (Chapter 5), using 
  The Minneapolis Table Building Blocks to implement The Seven Key Solutions.<br>

<p><strong>1/17/2005/#2. Watch PBS Bio of Jack Johnson, Mon & Tues nights, Jan 
  17 & 18, 2005</strong> 
<p><strong>PBS: <i> Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,</i></strong> 
  by documentary filmmaker Ken Burns (did documentaries on the Civil War, baseball, 
  and jazz). 
<p><strong> Jack Johnson: Heavyweight Champion, 1908-1914.</strong> Considered by many as 
  the best, along with Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali. He fought in an era when the 
  status of boxing was far greater than it is today and when the status of being 
  black was far worse than it is today. 
<p> In our book <strong><i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes,</i></strong> useful for 
  studies/reading/thinking for February’s Black History month, are individual 
  Blacks who are singled out for their contributions (see especially Interludes 
  3-4, 9, 11, and 15. There are stories featuring Black communities who have overcome 
  great adversities (Interludes 5-8, 10, 13-15). The web site reference about 
  Martin Luther King, Jr. below in BTL#2, outlines his life using three themes: 
  social justice, transformation, and reconciliation. Jack Johnson is an excellent 
  example of how to and how to achieve these. Booker T. Washington advised young 
  Black men to get ahead through industriousness and self control, as a way of 
  working for social justice. Jack Johnson was certainly a man of industriousness. 
  But he lacked self-control. W.E.B. DuBois argued for economic justice and urged 
  advancement of Blacks on all levels, in all pursuits. At this Jack Johnson also 
  excelled. His problem, however, as this documentary shows, which we see a lot 
  today, was that he put another personal creed ahead of these: “I’m getting’ 
  mind.” 
<p> Johnson was a complete fighter: big, powerful, speed, smooth, a shrewd defensive 
  fighter who feinted, blocked, and counterpunched and rarely “brawled.” Think 
  of it: a charismatic Black man, self made, in the ring, smiling, trash-talking, 
  chatting easily with the crowd all the while demolishing his opponents and receiving 
  torrents of racial slurs. It was for him that the phrase was coined, “The Great 
  White Hope,” anyone who could be him. 
<p> Burns describes him using Jack London’s 1908 description of him as a “man 
  of sunshine temperament,” despite this dark time called the “low point of African 
  American life after Emancipation” (words of Geoffrey C. Ward as quoted by Marty 
  Hughley). 
<p> As Burns shows, Johnson was a renaissance man who was “an avid reader, a history 
  buff, a musician, a night club owner, and even an inventor who held a patent 
  for a wrench.” Burns uses the title “Unforgivable Blackness” in his title to 
  suggest, in his view, that Johnson’s “original sin” was that he was Black. James 
  Earl Jones, on the other hand, suggests that Johnson’s story is a “story of 
  hubris [pride] more than race or anything else.” Martin Luther King said the 
  key was to judge a person by “the content of their character not the color of 
  their skin.” Johnson was a free spirit who felt he didn’t have to live by others’ 
  rules, and whose behavior to others was so “brazen, careless and sometimes despicable 
  unquestionably contributed to his troubles.” In other words, having offered 
  both sides, it comes down to what we Blacks know: it was the color of his skin 
  that made him a target. 
<p> When Johnson knocked out Jim Jeffries, “the Great White Hope” (that phrase 
  alone settles the debate) Blacks celebrated while Whites responded with rage 
  and violence (“setting fire to a Black tenement and then trying to block the 
  doors and windows so that no one could get out….” Some attempted to murder Johnson. 
  His downfall was “his predilection for white lovers.” 
<p> For Johnson, James Earl Jones tells us, “the issue of him being black was 
  not that relevant. But the issue of him being free and a total person was very 
  relevant to him.” 
<p> A key statement of Jones is “So what happened to him was he walked out into 
  a world that was not read to accept a Black man as a total person. And he didn’t 
  know how to function otherwise.” 
<p> This is the message of <a href=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/billcosbypoundcakespeech.htm>Bill 
  Cosby</a> when he addresses the behavior of young Blacks of the inner city who 
  don’t have Jack Johnson’s discipline to read, become a knowledge buff of some 
  kind (Johnson’s was history), master being a musician, a businessman, and inventor 
  as Johnson did. It is what we meant when we posted in November 2003 our <a href="../../solutionpapers/19higherhopes.htm">High 
  Hopes For Young Black Men</a>, as we maintain our concern about the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a>. We encourage everyone to watch this series 
  on PBS on Jack Johnson and then read our “solution papers” ( <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm"> 
  The Blocks to Construct a Minneapolis Table for All to Sit at Together </a> 
  and <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">Seven Solution areas</a>), 
  and talk about how we can implement them such that we can raise up a generation 
  of Jack Johnsons who are men of “sunshine temperament” who “know how to function” 
  in what can be a wonderful world of theirs with everyone else.<br>

<p><strong>1/17/2005#1, Questions from the past about the past: The James Sackett 
  case reopens.</strong> 
<p>The Star Tribune reported Sunday that Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner 
  announced the reopening of the 1970 shooting death of St. Paul Police Officer. 
  <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/467/5188885.html> James Sackett, 
  </a> and that two have been indicted and arrested, Ronald L. Reed, 54, and 
  Larry L. Clark, 53. We were glad to read that Gaertner said that "I expect at 
  the trial there will be some discussion of what motivated this horrific crime," 
  and we were also glad to read that Former Police Chief William Finney said "Like 
  many people, he was an activist, probably on the militant end," Finney said. 
  "Those were radical times. White kids, blacks kids, all kids were antiwar or 
  antipolice. That was the times." 
<p> We have several questions: how will the times be interpreted in terms of Blacks 
  and Whites, police and non-police? Why, of all the “cold cases,” was this the 
  one that St. Paul police Sgt. Tom Dunaski kept “warm?“ Was this was done with 
  a “local-federal task force” so they could seek the death penalty?” What pressure 
  has or will be brought to bear on the Black communities of St. Paul and Minneapolis? 
  Finally, in terms of this tragedy from 35 years ago, is this “payback” time 
  or will the system use this case in the spirit of Martin Luther King and use 
  it to bring about the three pillars of: <strong>Social Justice&#8212;Transformation&#8212;Reconciliation?</strong><br>
