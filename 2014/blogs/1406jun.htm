<p><strong>Gary Cunningham leaves position at NWAF  (</strong>Nortwest Area Foundation<strong>) to take position with MEDA (</strong>The Metropolitan Economic Development Association<strong>); Gary Cunningham is the Minneapolis Mayor&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>June  12, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Question  #1: </strong>&nbsp;What  happened to cause Gary Cunningham to be downgraded from his VP/Executive  position with &nbsp;the Northwest Area Foundation (NWAF, in top 100 foundations  in the USA) to The Metropolitan Economic Development Association (Meda), a  county organization?<br>
  <strong>Question  #2: </strong>Why did  only whites know about it before the deed was done?&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Question  #3: </strong>Thus,  when was he first approached and told he was leaving the NWAF for Meda?&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Question  #4: &nbsp;</strong>Did  the NWAF not meet its vision under Cunningham's watch (&quot;Thriving  communities through equal economic participation&quot;) nor achieve its mission  (&quot;Help entrepreneurs of color succeed!&quot;)?<br>
  <strong>Question  #5:</strong> &nbsp;Why is it Cunningham only stays 3 years in any job?&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Question  #6: &nbsp;</strong>why  do the white power brokers who establish boards and councils and advisories and  then appoint who will serve on them, install those who will maintain the status  quo by &ldquo;talking and walking in circles&rdquo; in order to ensure maintaining  no-change containment, so problems remain unsolved and thus their jobs for  dealing with them are not eliminated).<br>
  <strong>Question  #7: </strong>do  so-called &quot;black leaders&quot; serve in the House to contain the field  hands, the status quo and, therefore, their jobs?<br>
  <strong>Question  #8: </strong>is the  status quo maintained by the so-called non-profit do-gooders (churches,  foundations, charities, government safety net agencies), the not so hidden  &quot;job profit&quot; they get by keeping their non-profit jobs by spending  time on planning but not solving so that problems remain and, thus, their jobs  remain?</p>
