<p><strong>&#8212; B R E A K I N G &nbsp;&nbsp;N E W S &#8212; AGAIN</strong></p>
<p><strong>STAR TRIBUNE: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/104747594.html?elr=KArksUUUycaEacyU" target="_blank">NORTH HIGH TO CLOSE</a></strong><br />
  To be announced on October 19th.<br />
  People are dismayed. I called it in 2008, and suggested a solution. No one would listen. Now North will close. <strong>See</strong> <strong>my June 11, 2008 Column #21:</strong> <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/2008/columns/08q2.htm#0821c0611">How can we save North High School? Its end looks near, a sacrifice to Northside gentrification</a></p>
