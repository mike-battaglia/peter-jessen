<p><strong><a name="1001b0107" id="0830b9"></a>01-07-10 #1: Alert: Police: aiding and abetting, just  incompetent, or ran out of cover ups? Different standards for white citizens  than Black citizens?</strong></p>
<p>It is   all over the TV today, January 7: Minneapolis Police Officer Tim Carson, a 3   year veteran and Iraq vet, was arrested for robbing a dozen stores and banks,   raising the obvious questions,&nbsp;<strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;how   many other police officers are taking advantage of their positions?&nbsp;<strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;will there be yet another aiding and abetting cover up   by the Mayor and his Police Chief?&nbsp;<strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;As   the Mayor and his Chief claims to know all and do all, they are either aiding   and abetting or just plain incompetent, or their laxity regarding letting white   officers do what they want has gotten so bad that even this could not be covered   up as so much else in the past has been covered been.</p>
<p>These   are not questions I take lightly. Nor am I surprised as I raised these issues   with the MPD while serving on the PCRC (Police Community Relations Council); &nbsp;we   especially asked about background checks and rumors of white police officers out   of control, being involved in drug dealings and thefts. The MPD would not   answer; would not cooperate. Our concern was that questionable white candidates   were passed while qualified Blacks were not, raising another question regarding   whether the tests were rigged toward whites or just scored that way. Certainly   we ask, "How did Officer Carson pass his profile tests?" &nbsp;And, we suggest, the   city must lean to the best candidates, regardless of their color, and recognize   the value to the city of having qualified Black officers rather than unqualified   white ones. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And   how is it that when things happen to whites, nothing is said to the white   "community" about "coming forth", but when it happens to people of color, they   are asked to cooperate and come forward with information. This is currently   going on regarding the 3 Somalis gunned down (some say executed). How can the   community come forward when it doesn&rsquo;t feel safe? The MPD terror investigation   last year in the Somali community regarding killings that are essentially not   street crimes as defined but political killings, have left Somalis feeling   unsafe and unprotected.</p>
<p>The   mayor, broadcasters, and others follow the cue of the FBI and make the community   the problem, not the public safety system. Many young Somalis are survivors of   the Civil War in Somalia, and are here seeking a peaceful chance at life,   something made more difficult with police like Tim Carson, whose precinct locker   revealed guns and money. &nbsp;Carson reflects a department still out of control,   which is what led to the establishment of the PCRC in the first place. The MPD   continues to cover up the Metro Gang Squad, recently disbanded for their own law   breaking. &nbsp;Public safety is more important than any Governor's   race.</p>
<p>We   want to know how many others are like Tim Carson there are but who are more   clever in avoiding getting caught, and why, if the MPD leaders claim to know all   that's going on, why they let it ride and don&rsquo;t act on it? &nbsp;Some have said it is   because they are in on it. Others have said it is because they would rather have   poor white recruits that excellent Black ones and thus have to admit more   candidates of color to a department they'd prefer was all white.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay   tuned.</p>
