<p><strong><a name="0905b0606" id="0830b"></a>06-06-09, Blog #5: Welcome </strong><strong>NNPA (National Convention of the National Newspaper Publishers Association)</strong></p>
<p>When we attended the <strong>National Conference on Media Reform</strong> last June, in Minneapolis, we were struck by <strong>(1)</strong> how few Blacks were included in the NCMR program, <strong>(2)</strong> how helpless Blacks from other cities felt in their struggle to get the word out, to use the words of John B. Smith, &quot;to give voice for issues of concern that affect the ongoing development and success within the African American community,&quot; and <strong>(3)</strong> how very impressed they were by the channels that get the word out in Minneapolis (Black) newspapers' news and columns, TV show, web pages and blogs. </p>

<p>Return here throughout the weekend for our comments live and archive, on providing how Minneapolis provides &quot;journalistic leadership and devotion to efficiently promote community progress&#8230;to empower minorities through the Black Press.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to Tracey L. Williams</strong>, beloved publisher of our Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder and Co-Host for the NNPA, and to her Co-Host,<strong> Al McFarlane</strong>, publisher of the Insight News. To quote John Smith again, may they continue their &quot;impressive records as advocates to empower the minority community.&quot;</p>

</p>
<p>Michael Jackson, 12:21 p.m. PDT, call to 911<br>
  3:15 p.m., PDT: Michael Jackson rests in peace.<br />
  <br />
Our condolences to Michael's family, friends, and fans. He was more than the King of Pop, more than one of greatest artists and entertainers on the planet. He was a pioneer in the movement to achieve African American acceptability in America (over 700 millions albums sold bears witness to this), before Tiger, before Oprah, before Obama. Michael Jackson led the way for African Americans in the hearts of American and people world wide. From the Appollo to Neverland to London to Asia, he will be missed but not forgotten.</p>
