<p><strong>11-8-03 Introduction: </strong> We have become two types of American: 
  the 9/10 American and the 9/11 American, two different ways to view and ponder 
  9-11, whether this is really a world-wide terrorist war or not. The 9-10 view 
  literally white washes (pun intended) the seriousness of the event and acts 
  like it won't happen again. The 9-11 view sees it as an event in a wider world 
  war few understand. As of this writing, the 9-10 view says it was a mistake 
  to invade Iraq, that we are doing poorly, that it is becoming another Vietnam 
  style quagmire. The 9-11 view says this is a war to bring liberation and democracy 
  to people long enslaved by tyrannical dictators, and if we don't liberate/free 
  them we risk their bringing their terrorist war to our shores. Which view is 
  correct? From an inner city stand point, we pause to ponder the possibilities. 
  Whatever takes place we don't want to again be in last place, to be deferred 
  once again behind now Iraq. The US rebuilt Germany and Japan and turned them 
  into democratic and economic powerhouses. All we ask is that same effort be 
  granted America's inner cities. The problem? We believed the Germans and Japanese 
  could do it. We believe those in the Middle East can do it. The USA official 
  policy, as seen reflected in "The Kerner Commission Report" and "The Bell Curve" 
  is that we, unlike the Germans or Japanese or Middle Easterners, are different, 
  that we can't do it, and therefore little can be done. We call for the repudiation 
  of these reports by BOTH the Democratic and Republican parties and we call for 
  the same kind of post-World War II and post Iraq war rebuilding plan for the 
  people and place of our inner cities. 
<p> We take a back seat to no one in our patriotism, our defense of our country, 
  and we stand four square behind being integrated, not segregated from mainstream 
  America. Leave no war torn area behind, and that includes the inner cities of 
  America. Part IV has links to resources for achieving this goal. 
<p> <strong> Part I: 9-11-03: #131. 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Pausing to Ponder on the 
  Possibilities: American or Un-American: Part 1 of 4: Not Supporting Iraq at 
  the Expense of the U.S. but Parallel to the U.S. </strong> 
<p> <strong> 9-11-01</strong> changed the United States and world (their war protestors 
  this year represented the majority of their people whereas ours represented 
  a minority of our people). Certainly there would have been no war without 9-11, 
  when we were forced to finally give relevance to the mad men tyrannizing their 
  people and their neighbors and ourselves. But our response is at the expense 
  of our dream, to once again defer our aspirations. We may debate how and when 
  and where what we did/are doing in Iraq but there can be no debate about what 
  they did on 9-11 and what their intention continues to be. But as Paul Harvey 
  says, there is also "the rest of the story." The full story is not just that 
  because now a few men with a few thousand dollars can wreak the havoc of 9-11, 
  we live in the era of pre-emption, in which this war would be waged regardless 
  of which party occupied the White House. But the rest of the story is how we 
  got here. Both political parties have been involved in making Saddam a friend 
  of ours, even while he was invading Iran, even when he was killing his own people, 
  especially the Kurds and later the Shiites. That means there are unanswered 
  questions that make up the rest of the 9-11 story. But the answers to these 
  questions must be answered within the context of making sure there is a place 
  at the table for all Americans (see my book, "The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes," pp. 106, 297, 302, 328, and for fun, 271). 
<p> <strong> The first question is about the spending of billions of dollars to remake 
  Iraq while our inner cities are allowed to decay or funds spent are on White 
  bureaucrats and planners managing the decay. </strong> We fed and helped Europe rebuild 
  after World War I and again with the Marshall Plan in World War II. Where is 
  the Marshall Plan for our inner cities? Where is the GI Bill for education for 
  the service of those who descend from the service of slaves? Patriotic fervor 
  is fine, and we all sing "God Bless America" and "America the Beautiful" and 
  "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." But where is "We shall overcome" and "Amazing 
  Grace" and "His Eye Is On The Sparrow?" Saddam and guys like Norreiga and Pinoche 
  and others were our "friends" at the expense of their people when it suited 
  the purpose of this country. The $87 billion asked for Monday night is twice 
  what we are spending on Homeland Security and 50% more that we are spending 
  on education. We stood by and allowed brutality and genocide in Eastern Europe 
  and Africa, even as we did in the Middle East. Those are concerns but not my 
  chief concern. My chief concern is the brutality and violence in the inner city. 
  <strong> My concern is that White America still stands by and ignores the inner city 
  neighborhoods</strong> of Black Americans except when it can use it to create jobs 
  for White therapeutic and planning professionals. 
<p> Let's use a baseball term: <strong> the doubleheader. </strong> Let's address the rest 
  of the story and have a double header so that we address also the loss of jobs, 
  about which a report released Monday of this week by the Federal Reserve stated 
  that the lost jobs won't come back, &#8220;permanent changes in the economy mean new 
  economic sectors will need to be created to revitalize the labor market." In 
  1900, agriculture, that once employed 80% of Americans, enjoyed productivity 
  increases that eventually enabled 8% to do more than the 80% did before. Now 
  manufacturing is going through the same development: more and more products 
  being manufactured with fewer and fewer laborers. The world's economy squeezes 
  profits from wages rather that stopping the over production of existing goods 
  no longer needed in that quantity and finding new sectors to create jobs in 
  that won't squeeze workers. I want, dollar for dollar, the<strong> rebuilding of 
  America's inner cities</strong> as well as the American economy as a whole <strong> to 
  parallel the rebuilding of Iraq. </strong> Without that emphasis of funding our ball 
  game over here, I'm not interested in funding their ball game over there. Tomorow: 
  the second issue: Homeland Security and the Bill of Rights. 
<p><strong> Part II: 9:12-03: #133. 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Part 2 of 4: Pausing to 
  Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American: Not Giving Up our Bill 
  of Rights And Become What We Fight. </strong> 
<p> <strong> The second issue is that of Homeland Security and our Bill of Rights. 
  </strong> This is a real national defense political tightrope we must walk. We now 
  live in a time when their are "sleeper cells" in our midst. This creates threats 
  to us that if not handled correctly will create threats to our Bill of Rights. 
  These are hard, agonizing questions. Supporting each other is he American way/tradition, 
  not searching each other (the un-American way). Hence the agony and the dilemma. 
  A nation (US) and state (Minnesota) that allows the power grid to become so 
  decrepit that rural schools and the outer suburbs had to close for a day earlier 
  this month because of a "brown out" is about local and wider than local governments 
  that have forgotten its people. We must never forget that the heart and soul 
  of this country is <strong> We the People. </strong> 
<p> Just because 9-11 washed away the "we've got it made" post-cold war era of 
  1989 - 2001, doesn't mean that we can wash away what we stand for in a cold 
  bath of fear. We, as a country, still stand for the best and do so better than 
  any other. <strong> We will endure. We will prevail. But only if we do it together, 
  with everyone at the table. </strong> This is not the time to exchange sacrifice 
  for compassion, or deferment again for our progress. We can walk and chew gum 
  at the same time. We can defend our homeland and what makes our home something 
  we sing about as "this land is our land," our freedom, our liberty, our Bill 
  of Rights. This is what matters. It is what gives us the integrity of a democratic 
  society and a model to emulate to the world. We must be "always vigilant." But 
  out of good cause, not paranoia. This means we must be vigilant not to let our 
  civil liberties collapse under the understandable desire for action nor let 
  our love for our civil liberties block the authorities from being vigilant with 
  those showing cause to be investigated. 
<p> We owe a debt to our people first while at the same time protecting them against 
  those who would take the country away. <strong> As Nellie Stone Johnson said, 
  "no jobs, no education, no peace in America." </strong> That has to be our concern. 
  Not just peace for the country as a whole but for its parts as well, including 
  peace in the inner citeis. And who could help lead the way in our inner city 
  Black communities? The NAACP. But will they? More importantly, can they? Not 
  the way they are behaving today (see &#8220;July 21, 2003 NAACP Takes Eye off 
  Prize&#8221; Occasion Paper on this web site). The local branch of the NAACP 
  has also taken its eye off the prize of freedom for all. Indeed, as demonstrated 
  by the local branch of the NAACP on Saturday the 6th of this month, the White 
  power structure has the Black leadership whipped into line in this city (as 
  in the country). They no longer stand for us. <strong> When will others join 
  me in having an honest discussion about these issues? </strong> I have laid 
  it out <strong> in my book, </strong> "The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes" 
  <strong> and in</strong> the Solution Papers on this web site<strong> (<a href=22actualize.htm>Seven 
  Solution areas</a> ). </strong> The leadership, White and Black, can run but 
  they can't hide. The spotlight of justice is upon them. When will they join 
  in that honest discussion? It is one thing to say to the Justice Department, 
  after 9-11, "don't let this happen again." It is another thing to take our civil 
  liberties away without reason to protect them and then have the NAACP take them 
  away in our local elections. 
<p> We are now at the point where talk won't cut it. The Justice Department and 
  the NAACP both have to perform their way to credibility. Insincerity talks. 
  Credibility walks. We can tell the difference between these by whether or not 
  everyone is invited to the table. That is my definition. What is yours?

<p><strong> Part III: 9:12-03: #135. 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Part 3 of 4: Pausing 
  to Ponder on the Possibilities: American or Un-American: Supporting Each Other, 
  Not Segregating Each Other. </strong> 
<p><strong> Supporting each other in war with many fronts: fighting terrorism, replacing 
  permanent job loss, meeting the need for education and jobs, ending the continued 
  deferred of Black dreams. I still hold out for the positive possibilities for 
  our nation of neighborhoods. </strong> 
<p> How do we support each other in this era of fighting the war on terrorism 
  and change in economics as manufacturing joins agriculture in permanent and 
  steady loss of jobs, as we work to find the replacement for manufacturing just 
  as manufacturing replaced agriculture? <strong> Supporting each other and inviting 
  everyone to the table is the liberating ideal of The American Way although not 
  always the practice, as our miserable failure with slavery, Jim Crow, post 1968 
  Kerner Commission Report saying Blacks can't make it on their own, etc. so clearly 
  demonstrate. </strong> But we must not let go of the ideal. It is part of the 
  prize on which we have set our eyes. We can read more about our American ideal 
  of supporting each other at http://www.iscv.org/Civic_Idealism/Supporting_One_Another/supporting_one_another.html, 
  which has statements supporting this, from Alexis de Tocqueville to the Declaration 
  of Independence and the Preamble to the Constitution, Washington, Jefferson, 
  Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and Martin Luther King, Jr.). At first they applied to White 
  males, then White women, then to Black professionals. Now I fight to include 
  inner city Blacks and other minorities. An excellent resource place is the web 
  site www.iscv.org (The Institute for the Study of Civic Value), a community 
  based web site. It helps put the question regarding the war on terrorism into 
  perspective: How will the War on Terrorism shape America&#8217;s civic values? 
  Already, this new war has united us in a way that we have not experienced since 
  World War II. Will this solidarity remain? What forms will it take? 
<p>On the other hand, will the War Against Terrorism undermine many of the critical 
  civic values that we work to preserve? As an example, will the Bush administration&#8217;s 
  new Department of Homeland Security become a 21st Century version of J.Edgar 
  Hoover&#8217;s FBI? There are real risks here&#8212;but surely it ought to be 
  possible to fight a war against terrorism without becoming terrorists ourselves. 
<p>Tomorrow I will offer a pair of "pathways", with web sites, that can be followed 
  to maintain our civic liberties and security, the American Way, and do so for 
  <strong> We the People, </strong> to help us insure that in our war on terrorism 
  we don't bring terror to innocent citizens. The leadership, White and Black, 
  can run but they can't hide. The spotlight of justice is upon them. <strong> 
  When will they join in that honest discussion of our inner cities and our economy 
  and invite everyone to the table, not just the professional therapists, planners, 
  and other assorted program bureucrats serving their retirement accounts while 
  not being held accountable for denying our access to the table? </strong> Saturday, 
  September 13, 2003, 6:59 a.m. 
<p>Part IV: 10-16-03: #189. 2nd anniversary of 9-11: Pausing to Ponder on the 
  Possibilities: American or Un-American: Part 4 of 4: The "pathways" for maintaining 
  our security as well as our civic values of freedom at home and leadership for 
  peace in the world and, therefore, equal access and equal opportunity for all 
  citizens, and tools, skill, optimism and hope for doing so. 
<p><strong>There are a pair of "pathways" </strong>to start with to enable <strong> 
  We the People</strong> to still count. These are two of many. These two are 
  offered as starters for the discussion and as blueprints for action to take. 
  <strong> The first pathway</strong> is in the "Solution Papers" section of this 
  web site, my 7 Solutions paper, which covers these 7 topics: (1) education, 
  (2) jobs, (3) housing, (4) public safety, (5) safe environment, (6) governing, 
  and (7) moral/ethical stances. These are followed by my rationale and a list 
  of additional resources. <strong> The second pathway</strong> is posted on the 
  ISCV (Institute for the Study of Civic Values) web site here. It has a series 
  of rich resources, including LINKS to statements and resources for dealing with 
  these topics pertinent to our dialogue in Minneapolis as well: <a href=http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Cities/cities.html target="_blank" >CITIES</a>, 
  <a href=http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/CommDev/commdev.html target="_blank" www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/CommDev/commdev.html >HOUSING</a>, 
  <a href= http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Crime/crime.htm target="_blank" >CRIME</a>, 
  <a href= http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Jobs/jobs.html target="_blank" >JOBS</a>,

  <a href= http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Cities/cities.html target="_blank" >HEALTH</a>, 
  and <a href= http://www.neighborhoodsonline.net/Organizing/Human_Services/human_services.htm target="_blank" >POVERTY</a>
<p>These sites help provide excellent starting points for the leadership, White 
  and Black. The spotlight of justice is upon them. Rather than trying to run 
  and hide (they can run but they can't hide), I invite them to join me in an 
  honest discussion of these points.
