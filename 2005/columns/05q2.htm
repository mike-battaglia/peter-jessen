<p><strong><a name=0513c0629 id=0513c0629></a>June 29, 2005 Column #13: Can we eliminate 
  ourselves through violence in our streets?</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>There is a <strong></strong>word in Webster&#8217;s dictionary called &#8220;extinction.&#8221; 
   It refers to the end, to the disappearance of a species.  Given 
  the increased violence in our city over the last twenty days, and with the loss 
  of so many young men and women, the African American community is proportionally 
  flirting with self-genocide.  The end of a species.  The disappearance 
  of our race.  </p>
<p>Oh I know in a serious vein, this is hyperbole, as based on all the arguments, 
  it should be impossible for us to kill ourselves off.  But oh my how we 
  seem to be trying. I don&#8217;t know how many more 15 year olds can be shot 
  in the head, how many 20 year olds can be executed in the middle of the street, 
  how many girl friends can be gunned down in their homes, or how  many 
  small children just trying to get a good night&#8217;s rest can be shot in the 
  shoulder or in other parts of their little bodies by stray bullets fired by 
  young men who have lost their minds and moral compass. </p>
<p>That, my friends, is how you begin to take the dangerous first steps towards 
  extinction, the disappearance of the species.  Will we stop this madness? 
   Will we reduce the violence?  Will we save our children and protect 
  our babies?  The answer has to be yes because the alternative is our death. 
</p>
<p>The foundation of any species, any people, any race, are their young.  
  And so we are going to have to make a commitment to do a better job of planning, 
  of educating, and committing ourselves to the saving of our race.  Unfortunately, 
  we aren&#8217;t going to get it done tomorrow or even next year, but we must put in 
  place an approach and a plan for the survival of the sons and daughters of the 
  African.  God judges a people by how they protect their young.  
  Right now we are not doing a good job, and somewhere in the heavens, somebody 
  is very unhappy with our efforts or, should we say, our lack of effort.  
</p>
<p><strong>A professional who does her job. </strong> A little over a week 
  ago we were all stunned by the coldness and the viciousness of the Minneapolis 
  Board of Education and its so-called evaluation of Superindendent Dr. Thandiwe 
  Peebles.  One of the most important features and considerations of her 
  selection was the importance of increasing the test scores, bringing them up, 
  preparing children, particularly children of color, to be more enlightened and 
  to be able to compete in the arenas of competition.  The Black community 
  has suffered terribly since the departure as Superintendent, the legendary Dr. 
  Richard Green.  Dr. Green, who was a product of the Minneapolis Public 
  School system, understood the importance of and the need for success, and so 
  he dedicated himself to the mandate given to him.  </p>
<p>A little less than a year ago, we thought the same mandate had been given to 
  Dr. Peebles:  increase the test scores, reconstruct the curriculum, restore 
  the confidence of parents in the mission of education.  But lo and behold, 
  less than nine months after being selected for the position and being on the 
  job, Dr. Peebles found herself under siege.  White folks didn&#8217;t like her 
  attitude, didn&#8217;t like her style, didn&#8217;t like her hair, didn&#8217;t like how she talked, 
  and so the board has made her aware of what is expected of her on this plantation 
  called Minneapolis.  She is expected to be obedient, subservient, do a 
  little shuffling, do a little bucking and winging, and at the same time talk 
  about how happy she is to be here.  </p>
<p>Now you know that is sick, my friends, but we are dealing with small, narrow 
  minded and vicious policy makers who are more concerned to kissing up to corporate 
  Minneapolis than they are in guaranteeing the education of children of color. 
   This represents a dark chapter in what the future holds for the education 
  of the African American child.  Dr. Peebles, you have done and are doing 
  a good job.  You are doing it with compassion, with caring and with reverence 
  for your profession.  Unfortunately, the people you report to have no 
  appreciation or respect for those attributes, my strong sister.  May God 
  continue to guide you and provide you with strength to educate our children. 
</p>
<p><strong>Problem solving</strong>. Our book and web site lay out solutions for 
  consideration. We invite the City Council, the General Mills Foundation, the 
  Minneapolis Civil rights department and the Police Executive Research Forum 
  to discuss and consider them. </p>
<p>We need to reform the entrenched interests, reform the obstructionist teachers 
  union, reform the hidebound public bureaucracies and move beyond the race/class/gender 
  trifecta.  We need to reform individuals AND institutions, and commit 
  to achieving good education AND jobs.  </p>
<p>To succeed as a community and not kill ourselves off we need to work with restraint 
  and cooperation, be optimistic and hopeful, and be pragmatic and realistic. 
   Let us be measured not by caskets but by building community, educating 
  our young, and providing equal access and opportunity for everyone.  Then 
  all survive. </p>

<p><strong><strong><a name=0512c0615 id=0512c0615></a>June 15, </strong>2005 Column #12: <strong>Operation 
  CARE defends Fortress St. Paul</strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p><strong>What puzzles us is the singling out of Black gangs </strong> 
</p>
<p>How appropriate it was that on June 1, Mayor Randy Kelly announced the implementation 
  of the crime-fighting program dubbed Operation CARE (Comprehensive Area Reclamation 
  Enterprise), just five days before America&#8217;s annual recognition of the anniversary 
  of D-Day, the day our troops stormed ashore at Normandy and triggered the beginning 
  of the end of Nazi Germany. 
<p>We can just imagine the warm and fuzzy feelings tonight in St. Paul&#8212;no, 
  make that all across Minnesota&#8212;now that 225 blocks of &#8220;terrorist 
  hotspots&#8221; have been identified, blocked off, and made secure. Now all 
  that is necessary are the sweeps, the roundups, the detentions, and, thus, an 
  end to crime and terror as we know it. 
<p>Eisenhower would have been proud, had this been Omaha Beach at Normandy. But 
  this is St. Paul. Nonetheless, Randy and his administration, in the spirit of 
  those troops coming ashore at Normandy and MacArthur coming ashore in the Philippines, 
  join the significant military hosts of history. 
<p>The June 4 Pioneer Press reports on the &#8220;hot spots,&#8221; but not, strangely, on 
  actual crimes. But hey, we don&#8217;t need any other intelligence but the fact that 
  they are Black blocks. 
<p>But there is a problem in paradise: The St. Paul Fire Department union is not 
  too hot about their deployment to these &#8220;hot spots,&#8221; but Mayor Randy says, &#8220;Shut 
  up and follow orders.&#8221; Nathaniel Khaliq, head of the St. Paul NAACP, has done 
  the right thing, taking to the barricades and raising tough questions about 
  the designation of 225 blocks of crime, insurgency, and just general disorder. 
<p>The only thing we lack tonight are the appropriate target names&#8212;Omaha, Juno, 
  Sword&#8212;for clearly there is a threat to the safety of the fortress state, 
  of the fortress city-state of St. Paul. As pointed out in the policy document 
  of PERF (Police Executive Research Form, at http://policeforum.mn-8.net), entitled, &#8220;Protecting Your Community from Terrorism: Strategies for Local Law Enforcement,&#8221; 
  that is now the order of the day. 
<p>And so, hallelujah, we now know that within a matter of weeks the eradication 
  of drugs and the halting of gun running will have been accomplished. 
<p>What puzzles us is the singling out of Black gangs. Eisenhower would not have 
  allowed the equivalent of this to happen, to ignore his rear. What about the 
  other gangs, such as the Hispanic, Asian, and certainly White skinhead gangs? 
  This is puzzling because, working off of the PERF plan, all communities of terrorism 
  are supposed to be dealt with. 
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you feel safer in the announcing of Operation CARE if Mayor Randy 
  and his command staff would have talked about these other enterprises of crime? 
  Certainly General Eisenhower and General MacArthur would have never allowed 
  such terrorist gangs to threaten their rear. 
<p>And so, as we move into Operation CARE in St. Paul, &#8220;Project Take Back the 
  Streets&#8221; in Cincinnati, Ohio, and &#8220;Operation STOP&#8221; in Minneapolis, we can all 
  rest just a little more comfortably, can&#8217;t we, knowing that the Plan is in effect 
  and that the roundup has begun? 
<p>By this time next year, we will be able to talk about and make reference to 
  our own D-Day. Let us hope it means Decisive and not Disaster. Do you get my 
  drift? 
<p><strong> Stadium groundhog still seeks shadow </strong>
<p>We haven&#8217;t heard anything about the stadium. We have been waiting to 
  hear from our civil rights institutions (the civil and human rights departments 
  of the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, NAACP, 
  Urban League), to hear of their strategies to guarantee that we would be able 
  to reduce the number of Black terrorists by making sure they have a shot&#8212;oh, 
  sorry, had &#8220;an opportunity&#8221;&#8212;at some of the lucrative jobs 
  developing across the metropolitan area (see our Spokesman-Recorder column of 
  April 20, &#8220;Black share of $5 billion construction: Zero&#8221;). 
<p>But we haven&#8217;t heard anything. Sorry. Bad statement. Haven&#8217;t seen anything. 
  You know that when it comes to opportunities for Black citizens, we hear a lot 
  of lip service but see very few concrete plans unless it is for the purpose 
  of putting Black citizens away, as in incarceration, as in jail (they are the 
  same). 
<p>So to be sure that our reading audience understands, we will, every couple 
  of weeks, be like the groundhog: We&#8217;ll keep poking our head up and asking in 
  every column, &#8220;Where&#8217;s the plan?&#8221; until we can see the shadow made by a plan. 
<p>Zygi has his plan. What about the others? We just want to know, as Black folk, 
  that we can come along also. Because not all of us can play football. We are 
  waiting at the construction site bus stop. Will the White construction bus stop 
  for us? 
<p>Jobs are important, no matter who you are or what you look like. You want crime 
  fighting? What could be better than to make drugs and guns less attractive with 
  paying jobs? That is how you preserve the life of the children. God bless America.

  Column #11: Reggie who? A dream has faded; May It Rise Again</span> </strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>In the May 26 edition of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, there were eight stories 
  and one poll on the sale of the Minnesota Vikings (the Pioneer Press ran five 
  stories and one poll question). After a short period of deliberation and investigation, 
  the NFL owners, in a unanimous vote, approved the transfer of the Minnesota 
  Vikings&#8217; ownership from Red McCombs of Texas to Zygi Wilf of New Jersey. 
<p>But in the hearts and minds of Black America, the question has to be: What 
  the heck happened to Reggie Fowler and the dream so many of us shared of his 
  being the first Black NFL owner, a breakthrough in the tradition of Jackie Robinson 
  or of Paul Brown&#8217;s 1946 Cleveland Browns? 
<p>There was so much expectation that the NFL would join the NBA in allowing equal 
  access and equal opportunity in the owner&#8217;s box, as on the field of play. One 
  sensed, with the anticipated breakthrough that baseball would not be far behind. 
  But oh, how dreams shatter, the sense of achievement disappears, and the reality 
  of the American sports scene sets in. 
<p>The only thing that history will show is that the Jewish ownership has returned 
  to reclaim the Minnesota Vikings. And, Reggie engineered something no one else 
  could do for three years. So, in that respect, success has been achieved. 
<p>After the euphoria of Valentine&#8217;s Day, it seemed that Reggie&#8217;s color set the 
  forces of obstruction to work. It appears that some of those who say they were 
  on the inside misread totally what was happening in New York, and they sure 
  missed what was happening at Winter Park. You have to stay on top of your game 
  if you are a journalist, Black or White. In this corner, we like to think we 
  raised the right questions in the right spirit with the right suspicions in 
  mind. 
<p>Congratulations, Red. You drove your price up while scaring some folks. We 
  don&#8217;t know who was more scared, the gang of 32 Augustans or the Oles of Minnesota. 
  But for a league that receives so much from African Americans, we hope it learned 
  from this that it can not only survive, but thrive by accepting and encouraging 
  the spirit and actuality of inclusion in the owners&#8217; suites. 
<p>America, 65 percent White, 35 percent minority, awaits NFL ownership to acknowledge 
  its diverse fans. America is indeed ready for the image of Marion Motley, Fritz 
  Pollard, Emlin Tunelle. 
<p>Although we don&#8217;t understand why the NFL loaned Red money to buy the team in 
  1998 but asked Reggie to have more liquidity than the price (to cover losses 
  and a new stadium), we were glad to read in the Strib that Reggie said he finally 
  achieved liquidity, just &#8220;too late,&#8221; and that Commissioner Tagliabue concurred 
  that it was not a matter of Fowler&#8217;s net worth, but of his &#8220;liquidity.&#8221; 
<p>Race, my friends, no longer needs to be the order of the day. Congratulations, 
  Red and Zygi. Thanks for the ride, Reggie. We were also glad to read in several 
  of the stories that now the league really does want to see a minority as a majority 
  owner. 
<p>The NFL got to know you, Reggie. In three years, you were the only man in America 
  to step up with an acceptable offer. Let your dream rise again. The NFL didn&#8217;t 
  die or turn to stone in your presence. You brought them millions of dollars 
  in free publicity. 
<p>We are glad to hear the NFL state its desire to right the ship of equal access 
  and opportunity to an African American. You have the desire. You now have the 
  liquidity. Why not you for the NFL team in L.A.? 
<p><strong>Wexler&#8217;s plan</strong> As you read this column, Charles &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Wexler will be 
  in town, putting the final pieces of his initiative in place. Forums are being 
  created, like in Chicago. Leaders are being paid. Many in our Black community 
  are being unfairly and unjustly labeled &#8220;terrorists.&#8221; The silence about this 
  is deafening. 
<p>A new era is emerging. A new doctrine is being put in place. The sins of the 
  child are being said to be the crimes of the family, which thus must also be 
  punished. Obedience is expected, as Alfred Flowers and Booker T. Hodges found 
  out. Don Samuels has said if Blacks don&#8217;t do what he and others in power want, 
  they&#8217;ll get no help from him. So much for &#8220;we the people.&#8221; 
<p>Who will have the courage and good citizenship sense to ask questions about 
  and inquire into Wexler&#8217;s Plan? Silence is more and more becoming the order 
  of the day unless you have been anointed by the Forum, who also, more and more, 
  do not represent &#8220;we the people&#8221;. 
<p>And so another piece of the Constitution is going to be shredded, and with 
  the help of too many of our Black &#8220;leaders.&#8221; And God help us all if crime doesn&#8217;t 
  disappear.

<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>Tyrone Terrill, Director of St. Paul&#8217;s Department of Human Rights, circulated 
  his infamous open letter to the communities of color April 28, 2005, calling 
  for drastic action against gangs and those related to them. We responded with 
  our open letter to Tyrone on our web page (5/8/05/#51). We asked Tyrone why 
  he was stabbing his own people in the back, making us the problem instead of 
  part of the solution, and letting Whites off the hook. 
<p>Then Don Samuels emailed Tyrone saying &#8220;I am all for this,&#8221; and 
  called for everyone to get on board, including &#8220;the black papers&#8230;KMOJ&#8230;black 
  cable show hosts.&#8221; In the Will Smith movie &#8220;Enemy of the State,&#8221; 
  Will&#8217;s character is chased by rogue agents who oppose the introduction 
  of legislation that would limit their powers. It would appear that Tyrone Terrill 
  and Don Samuels are eager to not only increase police power but to have it used 
  against Blacks, even if innocent, guilty by association. This we cannot abide. 
  This we cannot agree to. This we will fight. 
<p>75 years ago, Adolph Hitler prepared for his &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; for Jews in Germany 
  (finally established all nice and legal in what historians call the Wannsee 
  Protocol of January 20, 1942, that called for rounding up all Jews). Hitler 
  wanted the social and legal fiber of the nation adjusted. A new doctrine, a 
  new philosophy emerged for those who were declared enemies of the state, the 
  crimes of the fathers also became the sins of the children. 
<p>In Minnesota, the same scenario seems to be a foot in 2005, but with a twist. 
  The crimes of the children are now being called sins of the entire family. And 
  so a whole host of appointed and paid so-called civil rights protectors and 
  elected public officials are calling for rounding up not only gang members but 
  their families (see our column of May 4 and our web log entries #44-48. We have 
  received no disclaimers). 
<p>General Mills is applauding. Charles &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Wexler (paid by General Mills 
  and keeping the details of the plan secret), is the architect of Minnesota&#8217;s 
  new Nuremberg Laws, that the alleged crime seems to be seen as the crime of 
  all, as defined by race. It is somewhat frightening when those who are asked 
  to be shepherds of democracy, guardians of justice, and facilitators of what 
  is right, become so poisoned by their views that they embrace the dark shadow 
  of death, maintain that there are no rights that a Black person may enjoy, that 
  the system is not required to respect and honor Blacks. And this is being done 
  to us by fellow Blacks. 
<p>Most would agree that we should not accept money for services not rendered. 
  How is it that a Black public official of the City of St. Paul and a Black Councilman 
  of Minneapolis can indicate that Black police commanders cannot be trusted, 
  that some kind of band aid, response, or program be initiated to make it appear 
  that there is a caring for those who will be rounded up and dispensed with if 
  the gangs don&#8217;t all quit by Tyrone&#8217;s June 1st deadline? This is neither new 
  nor innovative (recall Nazi Germany&#8217;s &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; program of concentration 
  camps, our own Native American round ups, and our 1940s detention camps of Japanese). 
<p>We said in this column two weeks ago that Council members Johnson-Lee and Samuels 
  needed to &#8220;convene a forum to answer these questions and to lay out the plan, 
  and to give guarantees and assurances that constitutional rights will remain 
  in place to protect African Americans.&#8221; We as Black people deserve at least 
  that consideration, if for no other reason, out of respect for those African 
  Americans who have lost their lives in the great struggles for freedom defending 
  this nation. 
<p>Never, never, never should we declare that the value of our people and the 
  crime of the father or the son shall render a punishment against the entire 
  Black nation. That is neither Christian, nor Jewish, nor Islamic. It is frightening. 
  Why do Tyrone and Don continue to ignore our web site&#8217;s &#8220;Solutions&#8221; section 
  (including our comments regarding education, jobs, housing, public safety, environmental 
  safety, governing and ethics)? 
<p>The terrorist act of 9/11 happened. The Patriot Act was passed to deal with 
  such terrorists. No such terrorism exists within our community. Labeling our 
  young people terrorists and enemies of the state and calling wrath down upon 
  them only encourages the existing bias that resonates against the Black community 
  within the American judiciary system. Thurgood Marshall is gone. Do we have 
  attorneys prepared to defend the Black nation, and particularly our young of 
  the allegation that they are carrying out terrorist acts and are acting as enemies 
  of the state? We appeal to all who say they care about the future and the franchise 
  of the African American to take a moment, give sober reflection, and refrain 
  from self-genocide.

  Column </span></strong><strong>#9: The King Wexler Plan: The Round Up Has Begun 
  </strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>
  Rumors are circulating about pending Twin cities crime fighting plans. But the 
  devil is in the details. Facts remain facts. The PCRC (Police Community Relations 
  Council) was created by federal order to help. But we are shunned and left out. 
  Why?
<p> One of the most dangerous plans for communities of color is the King Wexler 
  Plan (the General Mills funded plan of Charlie Wexler). Rumor has it that it 
  is a successor to Hennepin County District Court Judge Lindsay Arthur&#8217;s 
  Plan of 1971 and 1972, which reads like the King Alfred Plan. The King Alfred 
  Plan was first revealed in 1965, in the book generally considered to be &#8220;one 
  of the most important novels of the tumultuous 1960s,&#8221; entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585675806/qid=1115187427/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-7106094-1818316" target="_blank">The 
  Man Who Cried I Am</a></em>, a novelized view of the harsh segregation 
  of the 1940s (protagonist Max Reddick is the author, John a. Williams; Harry 
  Ames represents Richard Wright; Marion Dawes represents James Baldwin, Minister 
  Q represents Malcolm X). The &#8220;totalitarian King Alfred Plan [is] the &#8216;final 
  solution&#8217; for Afro-Americans&#8221; who must act to avoid &#8220;the snap 
  of the white bear trap&#8221; (pp. 1-2). 
<p> This is why we call the General Mills funded plan &#8220;The King Wexler Plan.&#8221; 
  We fear this plan does not provide for our constitutional protection. This is 
  another reason why Wexler/General Mills needs to work with the PCRC. Why are 
  &#8220;we he people&#8221; told that the King Wexler Plan is a private document/private 
  plan, and that the public has no right or entitlement to see the plan? General 
  Mills is enjoying a comfortable reputation for having a &#8220;final solution&#8221; 
  answer to the colored problem. It has committed significant dollars to implement 
  its King Wexler Plan. The April 15 Star Tribune wrote of how members of the 
  PCRC attempted to call attention to the dangerous and diabolical aspects of 
  the King Wexler Plan.
<p> It is not General Mills but &#8220;We the People&#8230;form a more perfect 
  Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity&#8230;establish this 
  Constitution.&#8221; Our &#8220;government&#8230;deriving [its] just powers 
  from the consent of the governed,&#8221; not from General Mills&#8217;s consent. 
  The newly elected Black chairman of the city&#8217;s civil rights commission 
  says that he helped shape the King Wexler Plan. And Minneapolis&#8217; self-touted 
  &#8220;Black leadership&#8221; group claims they met with General Mills and 
  have also helped shape it.
<p>
  It allegedly contains detentions, quarantines, and other significant &#8220;crime 
  fighting&#8221; tools. The intent of the 1971 King Arthur Plan was to incarcerate 
  African American families it would certify as incorrigible and un-rehabilitatable. 
  The King Arthur Plan called for the creation of detention facilities at Glenn 
  Lake, Mn. In February 2003, remembering the tragedy of 9/11, the Minnesota Legislature 
  passed legislation creating holding facilities and quarantine zones in Minnesota 
  state parks. Understandable for terrorists. Not for Black American citizens. 
  In October of 2003, this columnist asked the Minneapolis City Council to withdraw 
  their participation. They refused.<p>
  One of the authors of that King Arthur legislation was then State Representative 
  Rick Stanek, later to be Public Safety Director Rick Stanek, and, after returning 
  to his previous job, Captain Rick Stanek of the Minneapolis Police Department 
  in charge of CID (criminal investigation/intelligence division). <p>
  And so today we again ask: why all the secrecy surrounding the King Wexler Plan? 
  What would cause a major American corporation to commit millions of dollars 
  to its implementation? And why will no one talk about the current features of 
  the plan that includes large payments to selected Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; 
  to keep the peace in the neighborhoods? Payments to who? Keep the peace how? 
  Based on what information and what intelligence gathering? Are they making &#8220;detention 
  lists&#8221;? <p>
  We call upon City Council members Johnson-Lee and Samuels to convene a forum 
  to answer these questions and to lay out the plan, and to give guarantees and 
  assurances that constitutional rights will remain in place to protect African 
  Americans. <p>
  Secrecy undermines democracy. The government withheld important and relevant 
  information from the Supreme Court and destroyed and altered evidence to justify 
  relocating the Japanese. Will the King Wexler Plan do the same? Former California 
  Governor and Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren endorsed relocating the 
  Japanese, later calling that the worst mistake of his life. Is this why he backed 
  &#8220;Brown vs. Education,&#8221; to try to end detention-like segregated education 
  of Blacks?<p>
  The plans for &#8220;detention&#8221; and &#8220;quarantine&#8221; are real. 
  The recent police round ups are real. Detention HAS occurred in Minnesota: Indian 
  reservations, until casinos, were essentially relocation camps. Japanese citizens 
  were relocated to internment camps in Savage, MN during World War II. <p>
  And don&#8217;t forget the quasi detention now of young Black men in America*: 
  1 in 3 in the penal system (projected to be 2 in 3 by 2020), 80% of special 
  ed classes; 35% of drug arrests but 75% of drug prisoners; 17% of drivers but 
  70% of drivers stopped; 40% illiterate; 50% of those on death row; 67% of juveniles 
  in adult court. <p>
  In 1922, after the &#8220;Red Scare&#8221; ran its course, Attorney General 
  Harlan Fiske Stone reined in J. Edgar Hoover and warned of the dangers of &#8220;secret 
  police.&#8221; Is this a danger of the King Wexler Plan&#8217;s secrecy too? 
  Why won&#8217;t they converse with us?

  Column #8: </span></strong><strong> Black share of $5 billion construction: 
  Zero. 
  What can be done to reverse &#8220;Blacks need not apply&#8221; for the coming 
  great construction boom?</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The big planning train has left the station, and even the porters 
    on this train are White.<br>
    What can tribes be offered in exchange for funding stadiums?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8220;Blacks need not apply!&#8221; signs</strong> have been posted 
  on nine major new construction projects: <strong>(1)</strong> a football stadium 
  for the University of Minnesota; <strong>(2)</strong> a baseball stadium for 
  our beloved Twins (possibly in Hennepin County behind the Target Center); <strong>(3)</strong> 
  a new casino for Mall of America Phase II; <strong>(4)</strong> major &#8220;destination&#8221; 
  development in Blaine, to include <strong>(5)</strong> a football stadium for 
  the soon-to-be-newly-purchased Minnesota Vikings, and be <strong>(6)</strong> 
  a hub to extend light rail from Minneapolis to St. Cloud, and <strong>(7)</strong> 
  a new casino in that corridor; <strong>(8)</strong> ancillary projects that 
  will be part of or next to these major projects; and <strong>(9) </strong>necessary 
  infrastructure development for them. <p>
  We learned of these projects a month ago when we attended a four-hour meeting 
  of a committee of the Minnesota House of Representatives that includes State 
  Rep. Neva Walker (one of our great champions in the Minnesota House). The committee 
  was looking at casino proposals, including Governor Pawlenty&#8217;s Native 
  American Gaming Bill. <p>
  Testimony that caught our attention was by John Williams, president of the powerful 
  trade and construction council. Williams, who is White, is also a board member 
  of the Minneapolis Urban League. He talked about the wonderful upcoming opportunities 
  for jobs in these projects. Here was opportunity once again for full inclusion.
<p> But that bright light of &#8220;opportunity gained&#8221; turned to the dark 
  night of &#8220;opportunity denied&#8221; on April 12, 2005, when the St. Paul 
  Pioneer Press reported the reality: a drastic and <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/news/11370276.htm" target="_blank">frightening 
  decline from eight percent to 1.1 percent of &#8220;minority participation&#8221; 
  in the construction set-aside programs of the City of St. Paul.</a> 
<p>Set-aside programs were developed to provide for at least minority participation 
  in projects using government funds. As a longtime, 45-year observer at court, 
  we have known that one of the greatest &#8220;access&#8221; struggles in Minnesota 
  for people of color is access to good jobs that have good salaries and good 
  benefits. Once again, we are denied.
<p>
  From various newspaper articles, my math tells me we are looking at a minimum, 
  conservatively speaking (with cost overruns), of over $5 billion in public and 
  private investment dollars. This is not about taking from one group to give 
  to another. It is about involving everyone in an ever-expanding pie. <p>
  Except we African Americans are not invited. We in this corner have already 
  been told that there is no opportunity for the African American community to 
  submit anything now, or to be considered at any point in time, because the big 
  planning train has left the station, and even the porters on this train are 
  White. Five billion dollars&#8212;do we get eight percent? No. Do we get 1.1 
  percent? No. We get zero percent.<p>
  Thus, everyone who is a mover or shaker or a player or observer following this 
  game of employment and economic development knows there are no intentions whatsoever 
  by Anoka and Hennepin Counties, or by the Cities of Minneapolis and Bloomington, 
  or by the State of Minnesota, to comply with their own compliance laws and include 
  African Americans. Four hundred years of being consistently shut out of economic 
  opportunity afforded by your tax dollar continues.<p>
  Blacks need not apply. Business as usual. Minnesota nice. Minnesota White. <p>
  Why have our Black leadership been so quiet when they had to know? Some sit 
  on the planning boards. Why did we again assume that as soon as the governor 
  began to talk about Indian gaming and the Twins and the Vikings and the University 
  of Minnesota, and talking about building stadiums for each of them, our Black 
  leaders on these boards would begin the discussion to put a plan in place to 
  include the African American community? Why have they not stood up for us? How 
  many will get their 30 pieces of silver for selling us out by being quiet?
<p> <strong>But maybe all is not lost. We hope State Rep. Neva Walker can help, 
  as well as the Native American community.</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/national/08gamble.html" target="_blank">The 
  New York Times (4-8-05) reported Native American economic game plans. </a> 
<p>The Cheyenne and Arapaho of Oklahoma have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/national/08gamble.html?pagewanted=2" target="_blank">offered 
  Colorado $1 billion to return to their ancestral home (Colorado) and build a 
  casino</a> near Denver. Tribes in Wisconsin and Oklahoma originally 
  from New York State are offering to return and build casinos in the Catskills. 
<p> Three landless tribes in California are offering casinos on San Francisco 
  Bay. In Portland, Oregon, tribes offered to pay 100 percent of a new baseball 
  stadium if they could build a casino by Portland&#8217;s convention center. 
  Turned down, they now have a deal for a casino in the Columbia Gorge 40 miles 
  East of Portland. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/national/08gamble.html?pagewanted=all&position=" target="_blank">The 
  NYT shows a map of 15 such casino offers.</a><br>
  <strong><br>
  </strong>So why not in Minnesota? Why not a stadium or two paid in exchange 
  for casinos or other project opportunities? This is a once-in-a-lifetime economic 
  opportunity our tribes should be considering. We African Americans should support 
  them in this.

  Column</span></strong> <strong>#7: Has the community abandoned Reed and Clark?</strong><strong>Why have those who benefited from their activism have fallen silent?</strong>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em>

<p>Why the silence in the Black community since the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/467/188885.html" target="_blank">January 
  16 report in the <em>Star Tribune</em></a> of the indictments handed down and 
  the arrests made of Ronnie Read and Larry Clark in the death 35 years ago, in 
  1970, of St. Paul police officer James Sackett? <em>The St. Paul Pioneer Press</em> 
  has provided a fairly balanced reporting of this. 
<p>
  Yet our African American community has been extremely quiet. Absolutely silent. 
  There was a time when there would have been ongoing discussion, including whether 
  or not to set up a legal defense committee to guarantee that these two African 
  Americans would receive the best legal representation possible in what is a 
  capital case. [See also our January 17, 2005 web log entry, #1: &#8220;Questions 
  from the past about the past: The James Sackett case reopens&#8221;]<p>
  As the federal government is involved, it is a capital case because the death 
  penalty can be requested by the feds, particularly if the government can show 
  that the planning and ultimate act were carried out with malice and forethought. 
  <p>
  Take note of what is taking place on the Red Lake reservation with respect to 
  16-year-old Louis Joudain, son of the tribal chairman: much discussion about 
  conspiracy, aiding and abetting, intent to carry out an act. Although he didn&#8217;t 
  pull the trigger, he could face the charge of murder in the first degree, a 
  capital crime punishable by death (although, in light of the recent U.S. Supreme 
  Court ruling, we can no longer execute juveniles). <p>
  We ask the emerging, burning question again: Why the silence? Why are we as 
  a community, as a Black nation, not raising the question of reasonable doubt, 
  innocent until proven guilty? And why have we not asked the question, &#8220;What 
  was the evidence and who gave the testimony that led to the reopening of this 
  35-year-old case? <p>
  Why are so many who enjoyed the glamour, the opportunities, and the prosperity 
  of that time 35 years ago remaining so silent? Because of the activism of Clark 
  and Reed confronting the racism of the day, they were instrumental in helping 
  to integrate the University of Minnesota, St. Thomas, Bethel, Hamline, etc. 
  Many retiring comfortably today benefited from the actions of those then-very-young 
  men.<p>
  Have Mr. Reed and Mr. Clark now been abandoned? And have we already determined 
  that they are guilty? Are we frightened of an examination of the conditions 
  and the environment of that period 35 years ago?<p>
  As the <em>Star Tribune</em> quoted former St. Paul Police Chief William Finney, 
  who was counseling understanding, &#8220;Those were radical times. White kids, 
  Black kids, all kids were antiwar or antipolice. That was the times.&#8221;<p>
  There is something not quite right here. As we said before, there was a time 
  when our questions and our probing as a community would have made us proud as 
  a people, as a Black Nation. How many readers have prospered and enjoyed the 
  vitality, vision, probing and aggressiveness of the young Black activists of 
  that day? <br>
  Have we lost the energy and the commitment and the sense of racial pride to 
  ask the questions and to step up to the plate? Maybe we are closer to becoming 
  an endangered species than even we in this corner would like to recognize and 
  admit to. <br>
  <strong><br>
  The Vikings purchase&#8212;how&#8217;s it going?</strong><br>
  We are most interested when the NFL will hand down its decision to allow or 
  not allow Reggie Fowler to purchase our beloved Minnesota Vikings (even though 
  we still maintain this is a private property affair solely between Red and Reggie, 
  and it would be a violation of monopoly law if the NFL turns down what Red and 
  Reggie have already agreed to). 
<p> It appears that our local media have had difficulty obtaining information. 
  We still have questions.<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5321133.html" target="_blank">The 
  3-31-05 Star Tribune piece on the new bond of $37.5 million</a> to launch the 
  Northstar Corridor lightrail makes us wonder if the Blaine anchoring will include both the Vikings 
  and a casino, or just a casino. We still wonder why the NFL is requiring Reggie 
  to lay up another $300 million in liquidity to cover &#8220;losses&#8221; in 
  the future when the new TV contract should more than compensate. 
<p> And when we read that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/142/5315140.html" target="_blank">Commissioner 
  Tagliabue will meet in Blaine with the folks there regarding a stadium at a 
  luncheon on April 6</a>, we ask if he is meeting on behalf of Reggie or Glen 
  Taylor? And does this mean the NFL will help finance a new Vikings stadium, 
  as they will do for Los Angeles (and as we keep asking and insisting that they 
  should do)? 
<p>
  <strong>How&#8217;s the NAACP doing?</strong><br>
  I understand there are a lot of tape recordings in existence of meetings held. 
  Why do we not have them transcribed and passed out to the membership? Is there 
  something to hide? Again?
