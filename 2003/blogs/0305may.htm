<p><strong>Blog #1. May 14, 2003: Scuttlebutt says Minneapolis elections to be scuttled. 
</strong></p>
<p>Reliable sources tell me that the Minnesota legislature will attempt to mandate 
  to the City of Minneapolis to either hold an election this fall, in which all 
  would run at-large or wait a year and hold an election in 2004 using the ward 
  boundaries for 2005. This would pit Samuels against Johnson-Lee, Zimmerman against 
  Schiff, leaving the 8th ward open, leaving Lilligren uncontested, and opening 
  it up so Jackie Cherryhomes can run again in Ward 5. Now, it would seem, we 
  know why Keith Ellison and Linda Higgens are holding a fund raiser for Jackie 
  in the next couple of weeks. So now the redistricting scam that I write about 
  in my book, Chapters 12 and 13, are back in play. And now Jackie can go from 
  council to developer and now back to council. Even Boss Tweed wasn&#8217;t that brazen. 
  So, Minneapolis, whither goest thou? </p>
