    <p><strong>March  26, 2003 Inaugural  Column: The Minneapolis Story Continues, Through My Eyes</strong></p>
    <p><em>&quot;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
    <p><strong>Freedom&#8217;s Prize: Equal Access, Equal Opportunity</strong></p>
    <p> For 40 years in Minneapolis I have fought for the Civil Rights prize of 
      equality&#146;s liberty and freedom for all. It is an honor and a pleasure 
      to greet you the readers of the Spokesman-Recorder as your newest columnist, 
      as I share with you the continued struggle to achieve equal access and equal 
      opportunity for all. I will ask the question, &#8220;how, in (fill in the 
      blank), is Minneapolis promoting or retarding equal access and equal opportunity 
      in such areas as politics (including elections and redistricting); police-community 
      relations (including mediation); jobs/wages (including contract compliance), 
      housing (including Hollman/Heritage Park), education; Black-White leadership 
      (including the Urban League, the NAACP, and the City Council); and raising 
      up young Black men. I will record the words spoken and the actions taken 
      in Minneapolis that answers that question and shows the &#8220;state of 
      the city&#8221; in terms of equal access and equal opportunity.</p>
    <p> I will write from the perspective of <strong>seven themes: (1)</strong> 
      encouraging everyone not to take their eyes off liberty&#146;s prize: freedom 
      and equality; <strong>(2)</strong> working to include everyone at the table 
      set by Minneapolis, seeking equal access and equal opportunity for everyone; 
      <strong>(3)</strong> to tell it like it is, as I see it through my eyes, 
      based on my past experience in Civil Rights activism in Minneapolis (16 
      years as Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, 
      1968-1973 and 1979-1983; 11 years as President of the Minneapolis Urban 
      League and 17 years on the Executive Committee 1971-1989; work with the 
      NAACP as Housing Chairman 1999-2002 and Executive Committee 1999-2002; and 
      Spokesperson for the Black Police Officer&#146;s Association, 1996-Present); 
      <strong>(4) </strong>recognizing that no one group has a monopoly on truth 
      although each has part of the truth, and to speak of the truths as well 
      as the falsehoods of both the political right and the political left, as 
      we seek that common ground on which we can all stand from which to work 
      together to solve common problems; <strong>(5)</strong> expose racial injustice, 
      best described in James Baldwin&#146;s phrase, that the system is geared 
      to keep the ni**er in his place; <strong>(6)</strong> update these topics 
      from my new book, &#8220;The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, which is 
      available now in local book stores and on line at www.amazon.com and www.TheMinneapolisStory.com; 
      and finally, <strong>(7)</strong> to join with Spokesman readers in the 
      common cause to make Minneapolis a better place for everyone. This column, 
      like my book, will pull the covers back and expose the Minneapolis experiments 
      in racial injustice, whether carried out by Whites or Blacks or both, just 
      as I do weekly on my &#8220;Black Focus&#8221; program on Channel 17, MTN-TV, 
      Sundays, 5-7 p.m.</p>
    <p> The Minneapolis Story is not only good for Minneapolis, it is good for 
      America. It is a story that needs to be told. There are many upset by events 
      &#8220;out there&#8221; as they cry out for peace in the world. I cry out 
      for peace in Minneapolis. But I tell you that unless there is justice there 
      and here, along with freedom, there can be no peace there and here. We must 
      promote liberty over slavery, truth over lies, and freedom over dependency, 
      in our common search for justice, fairness and freedom as well as dignity 
      and trust. That refers to state and local budgets as well.</p>
    <p> Like you, I want Minneapolis to be a city where the imperatives of the 
      human spirit can shine through. I want a city where healthy, well educated 
      children will grow up into healthy well educated adults. We need to prepare 
      our young people, especially our young Black men, for real work in real 
      places and end policies resulting in so many young Black men winding up 
      in jail, abandoning the families they have started, and not contributing 
      positively to their communities. We must all work together to end the cycle 
      of abuse, be it by us on each other or by the power structure on our community. 
      We have to clean up our own doorsteps as we complain about the doorsteps 
      of others. Do we, as a Black and White community, pay a little more now 
      to work with those we have left behind or a lot more later in those periods 
      before they get re-arrested and taken back to jail? Because I keep telling 
      my publisher to &#8220;put this up on the web,&#8221; they have created 
      a Web Log (or Blog) for me to use on <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com</a>, where 
  I will make comments between these weekly columns. And if you have things 
  you would like me to comment on, send me an <a href="mailto:edwards@beacononthehill.com">Email at Edwards@BeaconOnTheHill.com</a>. </p>
