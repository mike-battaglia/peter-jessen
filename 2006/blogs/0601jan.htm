<p><strong>1-17-06, Blog #1: An Open Letter to the Minneapolis Mayor and the Chief 
  of Police </strong></p>
<p>January 17, 2006</p>
<p>To: Mayor RT Rybak and Chief of Police William McManus</p>
<p>Gentlemen, </p>
<p>I write this open letter to you on behalf of Ms. Erline Skinner, the mother 
  of Tycel Nelson. I do so in my role as spokesperson for her family. </p>
<p>As the Minneapolis Star Tribune has reported, 15 years ago, the then Chief 
  of Police refused to approve the Medal of Valor for Sgt. Dan May for the mistaken 
  shooting of Tycel, Ms. Skinner&#8217;s 17 year old son. The paper also reports 
  that our current Chief says that if he had known of it he wouldn&#8217;t have 
  approved it either. So the first step toward healing is to admit there is a 
  grievous wound, not just to Ms. Skinner, but to the whole Black community. </p>
<p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune also reported the words of Sgt. Dan May on January 
  13 and 14. After reviewing his expressions of understanding of the pain and 
  humiliation placed upon the family of Ms. Skinner, the African American community 
  and, by extension, the City of Minneapolis, Ms. Skinner says it is clear that 
  Sgt. May understands the damage that has been done. </p>
<p>Therefore, Ms. Skinner, wanting the process of reconciliation and healing to 
  begin, makes the following request: that during the celebrations this week of 
  Martin Luther King, Jr., a time of fellowship and in the spirit of reconciliation 
  and healing, that Sgt. Dan May be allowed to return the Medal of Valor to the 
  committee, and that this act be recognized as the first step toward healing 
  and reconciliation. </p>
<p>This would be a fitting act for this week that celebrates not only Dr. King&#8217;s 
  accomplishments but also his method of non-violence. As he said hours before 
  his death, &#8220;we have to institutionalize nonviolence and take it international.&#8221; 
  Ghandi understood it would never work in the USSR. But it can work in Minneapolis 
  when we try to live, in Lincoln&#8217;s words, by our better Angels. Thus, we 
  need you gentlemen to summon the courage to lead this city to live by its better 
  angels in a campaign of non-violence against our communities of color. </p>
<p>Ms. Skinner, her family, and the African American community should expect nothing 
  less and thus her request bears repeating: that you, gentlemen, provide the 
  courage and the leadership to see that the city live by its better angels, beginning 
  with the return of the medal to the committee that awarded it. </p>
<p>Yours in the continued Struggle, and with the Blessings of God, </p>
<p>Ronald A. Edwards<br>
  Spokesperson for Ms. Erline Skinner and family <br>
