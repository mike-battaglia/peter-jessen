<p><strong><a name="0313c0924" id="0308c5"></a>September 24, 2003 Column #13: Selection of the Next  Police Chief: 
Can Minneapolis  Make History? I don&rsquo;t think so.</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>New Police Chief. Actions speak louder than words. RT  Ryback&rsquo;s actions speak clearly with his appointment of an Advisory Committee  regarding the next police chief: African Americans are of no importance in his  City Hall. The panel, to help in reviewing candidates seeking to be the next  chief, has no members of the Black Police Officers Association (no role in the  selection process for them), even though he appointed the White head of the  Police Federation. Promises? Forget them. Score? Point, set match: Rybak wins,  Blacks lose. </p>
<p>Current Chief Robert K. Olson will be gone no later than  December 31st of this year, maybe earlier. The Mayor has no shame: in  October 2001, when he was in a very close battle with then Mayor Sharon Sayles  Belton, Candidate Rybak sought out three high ranking African American Police  Officers to pick their brains about what it was that they were concerned about.  Learning or spying? They gave their points of view. Ryback used that to press  his advantage in the Mayoral debates and then dropped Blacks once elected. In  the course of his discussions with these African American high ranking Police  Officers, RT went to great lengths to promise they would not be ignored if he  won. Renegging on his promise, he now ignores them. His refusal to counsel with  the Black Police Officers Association represents what is clearly an ongoing  problem within the Rybak administration: the view that African Americans in the  governing halls of the City of Minneapolis  are really of no importance and have no place. </p>
<p>RT Rybak is doing what RT Rybak does best: whatever he feels  is best for RT Rybak, even if it is not the best for the city or its citizens. Consequently,  RT Rybak will maneuver the citizens panel to give him a favorable review of  both Deputy Chief Lucy Gerold and Deputy Chief Sharon Lubinski. The story is  well known with respect to the kind of consultation that was involved between  Candidate Rybak and the police federation and the promises that were made for  the administration. This led to the disaster that was the first three months of  the Rybak administration when he attempted to fire current Chief Robert K  Olson. Now the mayor intends to make good on his commitment to not only bring  in a new chief but to bring in one who is acceptable to the Police Federation. Lest  any forget, the Federation is a powerful political entity within City Hall. Ask  yourself this: will there be a repeat of what we saw a little over 8 years ago,  when the search for a police chief included two African Americans, one from the  St. Louis, Missouri  Police Department and one from the Houston, Texas  Police Department? Neither one made it to the final cut. This time around we  suspect there will not be any finalists of color (Black, Hispanic, Asian). But  to say would rub the Rybak administration the wrong way so we&rsquo;ll take the  posture of wait and see. But for those who envision the dream of Minneapolis  joining St. Paul, and selecting an  African American to head its Police Department, you&rsquo;ll have to wait until later  in this century. </p>
<p>Vikings:&nbsp; To be  here or not be here, that is the question. Will the Vikings be in Minnesota  for the 2004 football season? We&rsquo;re not sure. We have to assume Red McCombs has  worked with his attorneys to find a way to get out of the Metrodome lease. There  is still no doubt in our mind that Red McCombs is sticking to the plan to  leave. The University of Minnesota  has announced it is going to get its stadium by whatever means necessary. We  know the Twins will get something (and let&rsquo;s hope they achieve another American  League Central Division Championship). But not the Vikes. Monday of last week,  CCO went into great detail about how unhappy Red is. He is an unhappy camper  even though his team is 2 and 0 in the first two weeks of the season and people  are already talking Superbowl (let&rsquo;s not get carried away folks). The question  remains: how important is the loyalty of our beloved Vikings fans and does Red  McCombs give loyalty to the fans who continually pack the Metrodome? It doesn&rsquo;t  matter. The former owners sold it to him to move them so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to  take the heat. He continues to maneuver to take our beloved team, the Vikings,  somewhere else.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0312c0910" id="0308c4"></a>September 10, 2003 Column #12: Hollman low-income  housing lost: A Dream Deferred: Here  yesterday, gone today, nothing for tomorrow</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Here yesterday</strong></p>
<p><strong>On April 20, 1995,</strong> many thought the long-held <strong>dream  of affordable</strong> housing was realized in the courtroom of Federal Judge  James Rosenbaum, who presided over the consent degree settlement known as  ***Hollman vs. Cisneros***, and now referred to as ***Hollman vs. Martinez***  (Cisneros and Martinez being the secretaries of the federal Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at the time of these lawsuits). </p>
<p>On that spring day in 1995, many African Americans who had  been forced out of the public housing known as Sumner Olson in North   Minneapolis assumed that sometime during their lifetimes they  would have a right of return. </p>
<p>Well, there has since been much speculation and many rumors  on that subject; but it now appears, at long last, that the dream is terribly  deferred, judging from a series of correspondence culminating in an August 12  letter from William O. Russell, deputy assistant secretary of HUD for public  housing and voucher programs.</p>
<p><strong>Gone today</strong></p>
<p><strong>August 12, 2003:</strong> In a letter to Ms. Cora McCorvey,  executive director of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA),  Secretary Russell lays out, in very interesting language, the interpretation  leading to the federal government's decision to remove as much as $7.5 million  in low-income rental subsidy dollars. It appears that all 900 Section 8  vouchers awarded to the MPHA in 1995 as part of the consent decree are in  jeopardy. </p>
<p>Secretary Russell expresses HUD's extreme disappointment in  what, at best, can only be called very poor accounting procedures by MPHA, as  the mobility certificates have disappeared. This means that, right off the bat,  89 low-income rental units may not be built. </p>
<p>This loss is all due to the City, the developers, the MPHA,  the city attorney, those who took or destroyed documents, and the NAACP.</p>
<p><strong>August 29, 1999:</strong> In a letter and affidavit from Ron  Edwards to Judge Rosenbaum, acting as a member of the NAACP, I proposed that a  Special Master be appointed to preside over the completion of Hollman because  of the number of people whose rights had been violated by the way the consent  decree was being handled -- malfeasance and noncompliance by the NAACP, MPHA,  etc., </p>
<p>Without appointing a Special Master, a lot of time and  expense would be wasted by both sides frequently returning to the court with  appeals to settle differences, to fact-find, and to resolve disputes as both  sides attempt to hide the accounting of missing funds. A Special Master and  oversight committee could provide a neutral trust mechanism. </p>
<p>At that time, Tim Thompson and his cohorts (see below) felt  it was ridiculous for an African American to propose such an action (kind of  like the conference earlier this year in England  on Palestine and Israel  with no Israelis invited to participate). </p>
<p><strong>August 22, 2003:</strong>  A letter from Timothy Lee Thompson of the Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis  shows how the scramble has begun to find a scapegoat and point fingers. In this  letter, this White bureaucrat does something peculiar; some might call it  plagiarism, and a pessimist might say he was stealing my ideas. </p>
<p>An optimist, on the other hand, might say that the City and  the NAACP were finally, if begrudgingly, recognizing that Ron Edwards had been  right all along, for Thompson proposed what I proposed in more detail in 1999:  that a Special Master be appointed to preside over the completion of  Hollman/Heritage Park. I, of course, would add, &quot;if the completion ever  takes place.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>September   23, 2002:</strong> The above comes on the heels of the attempt on this date  by the City, public housing, and the NAACP to tamper with an order handed down  by Judge Rosenbaum in April of 2002, after which things have gone steadily down  hill. </p>
<p><strong>Nothing for tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>Next month, in mid-October, Judge Rosenbaum will hear  arguments by all the parties on the future of Hollman/Heritage Park. Why?  Because the conflict resolution regarding the requirements of the consent  decree among the various parties regarding Hollman has failed. </p>
<p>Some say it's sad, because well-intended people acted with  good intentions. Is that true? I don't think so. When they are trying to hide  the fact that they have spent all the money, that spells bad intentions to me. </p>
<p>My interpretation is this: The various parties seem to think  they can get the judge to give them what they want (showing the arrogance of  the different sides), so they won't compromise in good faith. So now they have  gotten their desired day in court. They may regret getting what they wished  for. Stay tuned. Watch and listen carefully. </p>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> There will be no money for low-income  rental programs for the project known as Hollman, because the money is <strong>gone</strong>.  The mobility certificates are <strong>gone</strong>. Low-income rental properties are <strong>gone</strong>.  And most definitely, low-income rental housing for African Americans in Minneapolis  is <strong>gone</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0311c0827" id="0308c3"></a>August 27, 2003 Column #11: The Hollman/Heritage Park Saga Continues: 
A Little Bit of Poison Is OK, Afterall these are only Black  children</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in the water at Heritage   Park and Winter    Park? </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the water&rdquo; is only funny on TV sit-coms. It&rsquo;s not  funny at Hollman/Heritage Park. In this week&rsquo;s column we explore two very  interesting letters. The first is the cover letter of Richard D. Baron,  Chairman and CEO of McCormack Baron Salazar (dated August 7, 2003) to Chuck Lutz of MCDA (Minneapolis  Community Development Agency (charged with the city&rsquo;s oversight of Heritage   Park). The &ldquo;Dear Chuck&rdquo; letter  states: &ldquo;In keeping with our commitment to provide a safe and healthy  environment for residents at Heritage   Park, enclosed please find the  sampling and analysis result from Braun Intertec Corporation.&rdquo; He attaches the  analysis letter from Jon A. Carlson, Vice President of Braun Intertec, also  dated August 7, 2003. Why  hasn&rsquo;t the city made the letter public (as of August 21)? What is the MCDA  hiding? This is one of the greatest shams in the history of environmental  investigation. </p>
<p>I question Braun Intertec&rsquo;s analysis because (1) we were  promised an independent analysis, which is standard in the industry when there  is question about work performed. As Braun Intertec was paid millions for  supposedly cleaning the site before construction and are dependent on giving  themselves a clean bill of health, they have a clear conflict of interest; and  (2) at a meeting Thursday, August 14, the McCormack Baron/Braun Intertec folks  told us the toxins were not petroleum based and didn't address the buried  asbestos. The state environmental person at the meeting said that it was  petroleum based. The MCDA person said they didn&rsquo;t spend the money on cleanup.  Clearly the fox was put in charge of the hen house. Only an independent  analysis can resolve this. </p>
<p>Clearly Braun Intertec is not an independent, impartial, or  unbiased entity in the examination of problems of toxicity and questionable  environmental conditions. This is putting the fox in charge of the hen house.  On the very first page and then sprinkled (if you will excuse the pun)  throughout the report, was the presence of arsenic in the samples of the so  called Rain Garden  and the children&rsquo;s playground. There&rsquo;s no indication at this point (despite the  taking of the samples nearly a month ago) that anyone has taken significant  action to reassure the residents of that their children will be safe, now and  in the future. </p>
<p>Arsenic does not just fall out of the sky. It&rsquo;s not manna  from heaven. How, since the very detailed reports prepared by the city of  Minneapolis in July of 2000, and the oversight of the NAACP, has the arsenic  since gotten into the ground water undetected with all the monitoring equipment  that the tax payers of this city paid for to guarantee environmental protection  (or did they spend it on something/someone else or just not use it?). One gets  the sense that if children are poisoned it is OK as long as they are Black. </p>
<p>And consider this: why the intimidation attempt last week by  McCormack Baron&rsquo;s Braun Intertec to assassinate the character of us activists  by spreading rumors that we were coming to the site packing guns? Why do they  respond with slander rather than with truth, integrity and ethics? They  continue The Minneapolis Story. We will continue to counter them with our daily  truth fest on our web log. Truth is in our water.</p>
<p><strong>Viking story suppressed; bad security risk kept on. </strong></p>
<p>Last Wednesday and Thursday (8-20 &amp;21-03), 6 &amp; 7  days after we reported it on our web log, the suppression of the news by the  papers and Clear Channel stations (owned by Vikings owner Red McCombs) about  criminal activity at Winter Park was lifted. TV, led by KSTP, reported it  Wednesday, the Star Tribune and PiPress on Thursday: that a White Eden Prairie  Police officer was involved in credit card and identity theft of Black players.  I also reported that others are involved which is not being mentioned yet. It  will. The truth will come out. I&rsquo;m tempted to say, &ldquo;hey guys, get on a horse  and catch up.&rdquo; But we didn&rsquo;t so much as &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; them as we didn&rsquo;t suppress news  as the team and the major media did. It makes me wonder what else they are  suppressing besides this, Hollman, etc? This is about how their high level  White boys are ripping off their higher paid Black players. That the Vikings  have been going down hill for 20 months is no surprise to the Black community.  What&rsquo;s in their water that makes them think we are fooled by this? NOTE: a  puzzlement: how is it that when the Black head of internal security recommended  last year that this Eden Prairie officer be terminated, the White front office  response was to give him more authority and responsibility? Does this mean they  were protecting their own or were in on this scam or is it something else? </p>

<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Minutes of meetings:</strong> This column reflects a trail of  lies and broken promises regarding Hollman/Heritage Park, based on minutes of  meetings listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Late 1999:</strong> Minneapolis  reported that the cleanup and cleansing of the area had begun in earnest. </p>
<p><strong>July 21, 2000:</strong>  City representatives discuss their commitment to the regulations and  requirements of the federal government entrusted to them in 1996, as we  previously reported. There was much discussion of the monitoring system and of  how toxic reports pertaining to the contaminated water would be dealt with. </p>
<p><strong>September 22,   2000:</strong> Additional follow-up and additional strategies  were discussed with respect to the reporting process of the toxic cleanup. </p>
<p><strong>October 20,   2000:</strong> A very extensive report was given to the Hollman  Implementation Committee chaired by then-city council member/president Jackie  Cherryhomes. There was much discussion of a $2.9 million funding request for  clean-up of areas of contamination just south of Olson    Memorial Highway. There was also much discussion  of the monitoring mechanism that was supposed to be in place for the site north  of Olson. </p>
<p><strong>October 19,   2001:</strong> 365 days later, the trail of lies and broken  promises continued at a meeting held with additional discussion of the systems  in place; the cleanup cost had by then grown to $3.8 million. The discussion  covered the existence of protective mechanisms to guarantee that cleanups had been  completed, including, but not limited to, monitoring ground water, wells, and  testing soil samples. </p>
<p>The City initiated a voluntary investigation and cleanup  program (VIC), a voluntary petroleum investigation and cleanup program (VPIC),  and a construction contingency plan and response action plan (CCP/RAP) for fuel  oil contamination at the former Sumner Heating Plant. It also initiated the  covering of asbestos-wrapped pipes buried on the site. </p>
<p>The monitoring process was reported as being in place. This  had been reflected earlier in the City's July 2000 report to the federal  government. What happened to that money? What will the federal government do  about the submitted lies? And what will the City do about the illegal buried  asbestos-wrapped pipes? Has there been a report? If so, when?</p>
<p>June 8, 2001:  A peculiar communique was sent by the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority  (MPHA) to Braun Intertec Corporation, to the attention of Mr. Chris McElligott,  their lead person for remedial environmental cleanup for Phase I of the Hollman  project. Belair is identified as the recipient of $428,057 for cleaning up the  contaminated soil and other areas immediately adjacent to the former Sumner  Heating Plant, which was located at 631 Bryant Avenue    North. </p>
<p>This letter was signed by Minneapolis  city employee Leslie A. Woyee. The letter makes mention of the arrangement and  agreement with Belair and Braun Intertec for the beginning of the cleanup of  contaminated soil and other materials. </p>
<p><strong>July 30, 2003:</strong>  A ***Minnesota Spokesman Recorder*** front-page story shows how this is but a  part of a much larger pollution problem. Their map shows the pollution sites at  Hollman/Heritage Park, as well as many more sites in the area between it and  the Mississippi River, with a North-South area three  times the size of Hollman/Heritage Park. <br>
In conclusion: We bring these dates and information to you  in light of the City's inability (refusal?) to (1) produce reports that show  that they have carried out their 1996 federally mandated responsibilities, and  (2) the inability (refusal?) of the City to encourage Braun Intertec, McCormack  Barron, and Urban Strategies to produce the results of the tests they have made  over the past five weeks. </p>
<p>Reliable sources say that many documents have been destroyed  or purged (many taken by Jackie Cherryhomes). In light of the discovery of the  first child with blood lead content and the refusal by the City to conduct a  massive examination of current residents in that facility, we have no  alternative in this column but to give significant credence to the stories that  the City, in violation of federal law, has, in fact, destroyed pertinent  information identified by the City and certified by the City in its reports to  the federal government in July 2000 and other years. </p>
<p>Minneapolis,  McCormack Barron and Braun Intertec must prove they are not hiding anything  when they use the fiction that they can't discuss tests from a public-private  partnership. The reports about these contamination issues must be released to  the public. They plunder the City treasury. They pick the taxpayers' pockets.  They gain nothing with their Trail of Lies and Broken Promises.</p>
<p>Minneapolis,  stop refusing to look in the mirror. Minneapolis,  look and learn.</p>

<p><strong><a name="0309c0730" id="0308c"></a>July 30, 2003 Column #9: Violation of a trust, betrayal of a people: 
The Hollman/Heritage Park environmental minefield chronology</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>February 11,   1994:</strong> President Clinton signed Presidential Executive  Order 12898, a federal action to address environmental justice and human health  conditions in minority and low-income populations, and directing federal  agencies to deliver, by March 24, 1995,  an environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects in  minority and poor populations.</p>
<p><strong>April 20, 1995:</strong>  The parties in the case known as Hollman vs. Cisneros reached an  agreement that included $117 million to begin the process. Despite that  document and despite Executive Order 12898, the City of Minneapolis  began its process of circumvention and retaliation. </p>
<p><strong>October 14,   1996:</strong> The Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) assigned to the City of Minneapolis  the responsibility for environmental protection and to certify same in regular  reports.</p>
<p><strong>May 17, 2000:</strong>  The City of Minneapolis submitted  to HUD a proposal for additional funding for Hollman (now called Heritage   Park), hoping to net the City $36.2  million in additional funds for the building of new housing. On page 35 of the  document, the City discusses the need for &quot;hazardous reduction&quot; on  the site, asking, on the &quot;Baseline Data Report Budget&quot; page, for  $8,695,168 &quot;clean up for soil contamination and other hazardous soil  conditions,&quot; etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>July 2000:</strong> After having contracted with SRF  Consulting Group of Minneapolis, Minnesota (1 Carlson Parkway North, Suite  150), the City prepared and certified and submitted to the federal government a  document identified as &quot;Minnesota Environmental Assessment Worksheet and  Federal Environmental Assessment for the Near Northside Redevelopment Project,  Minneapolis, MN&quot; (see pages 29, 30, 32, 32 and 60). We assume that this  document will and can be recovered by City officials. God forbid that it has  been shredded or lost. </p>
<p><strong>July 23, 2003:</strong>  I am puzzled by the article on this day by Steve Brandt in the StarTribune  newspaper. I am particularly puzzled by the lack of admission by the City of Minneapolis  of the fact that they were assigned environmental responsibility by HUD in  1996. Instead, Brandt is reporting that City officials are now saying, as of  today, that there are no environmental problems that could bring about nausea,  headaches, nose bleeds or medical indications; nor, God forbid, is there lead  poisoning. </p>
<p>This is puzzling because of the documents the City has suppressed  that show soil lead levels that are greater than 1,400 parts per million (ppm)  on the current Hollman/Heritage Park site (the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency [EPA] only allows 400 ppm), and that water testing shows unacceptable  levels of more than 23 milligrams of lead per liter of water. </p>
<p>We ask -- no, on behalf of the children, we beg -- the City  of Minneapolis to make available  immediately the tests results they indicate that they took approximately 10  days ago that reportedly were returned today. This must be done. It is a first  step to repair the public trust that has been violated and to reverse the  betrayal of African Americans and other people of color pertaining to the  requirements, demands and expectations of the Executive Order identified as  12898, signed by the President of the United    States, William Clinton, on February 11, 1994. </p>
<p>To do anything less is to aid and abet the criminal acts  being perpetrated against the children in the name of progress, developer  greed, and the city's apparent desire to maintain the status quo and keep us in  our place.</p>
<p><strong>What's next? </strong></p>
<p>How about as soon as possible the City (1) acknowledge its  responsibility, (2) announce what it will do about it, and (3) list how it will  evaluate its own progress and performance. </p>
<p>Recently, on our television program Black Focus, we  suggested an approach that can begin to reestablish the trust that has been  severely damaged: Make public the housing quality standard inspection documents  (HQS's) that specifically pertain to Hollman/Heritage Park. Lay out the  problem. Invite us to work together to resolve it. Punishment is not our goal.  Restoration is. Let's lead the charge to show how. </p>
<p> See the award-winning story in the Dallas Morning News,  &quot;Living in Fear: Residents in Projects Find Common Neighbor,  Pollution,&quot; and &quot;Toxic Traps, Living in Fear.&quot; We are in danger.  There has clearly been a violation of the rights of all. We ask the City to  move with speed, dispatch and compassion. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0308c0716" id="0308c0716"></a>July 16, 2003 Column #8: <strong>An Environmental Mine Field: Heritage  Park/Hollman</strong></strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
  A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OR NOT?</strong> Since April 20, 1995, the defendants in the case known as  Hollman vs. the United States Government have been required to submit annual reports  to the federal court (to Chief Judge James M. Rosenbaum, Federal Court for the  Federal District of Minnesota). The defendants have fudged their annual  reports, including in the area of environmental protection. </p>
<p>Why is it that a week ago we came across a manager of that  facility warning residents and children of the dangers of the oily water and  the toxicity in the area of 7th and Van White Memorial Drive? So, on  our own, using a private environmental testing agency, we had water samples  taken and tested. When we get the results back we&rsquo;ll report them in our next  column.</p>
<p>We were called there by residents concerned about threats made  against them if they speak out on the problems of the toxicity. We are shocked  by the level of toxicity, of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; bubbling up from underground, especially  at children&rsquo;s playgrounds. Most disturbing is the number of residents showing  the effects of the toxicity: diarrhea, headaches, skin rashes, nose bleeds,  etc. Indeed, each time in July that we visited Hollman, we always came away  with a headache. When will the city, especially the new administration, act  responsibly and begin to move to protect the interests of those citizens now  placed in harm&rsquo;s way? </p>
<p>This caused us to review both the minutes of meetings of the  Nearside Implementation Committee, a citizens group which had very intense  discussions about the dangerous environmental impacts taking place at Hollman,  and a map put together by Braun Intertec, a company contracted by city  officials ($1.2 million contract) to conduct a study of soil conditions and  other problems involving toxicity (they may no longer meet but we still  annually review the map that shows the &ldquo;hot zones&rdquo; in the Hollman site. They  were to remove contaminated soil as part of the cleanup. [Footnote: it is  interesting that a Braun Intertec sub-contractor, Bell Air of Minneapolis  ($426,000contract), has a direct relationship with a sitting County Commissioner.] What did  Braun Intertec do and what was their final report? </p>
<p>Key meetings include those of 2000: July 21, August 18, October  20, and 2001: February 9, May 11, September 21, and October 19. In all of these  discussions, including those about contaminated soil and contaminated water,  elected and appointed government officials were present. It was quite clear to  all that there were serious environmental problems. Why, then, do we still have  the toxicity that is there today?</p>
<p>We are saddened that City Hall and others have decided to do  nothing with this environmental minefield. We are saddened by the number of  people who have become ill. We are saddened by the threats of retaliatory  action against any citizen of color that speaks out about the serious health  problems that exist. Saddened but not surprised, as we wrote about these  environmental problems in Chapter 8 of my book, which one person suggested, is  a living witness for North Minneapolis as expressed in the old Spiritual, &ldquo;How  long, O Lawd, how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city council needs to have the intestinal fortitude (that means  guts) to conduct a public hearing, and ask that work be suspended on that  project until there is an environmental study followed by an environmental  clean up. That is the least we can ask for. When can we stop saying that what  is happening is what we can expect for children of color? Can you imagine the  swift action if it was White children?</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION IN SELECTION OF NEW POLICE CHIEF OR NOT?</strong> We were  not surprised to hear of the City embarking on seeking a new chief of police to  replace Robert K. Olson (as first reported in this column almost two months  ago). We appeal to the office of Mayor R.T. Rybak and the leadership of the  City Council to allow meaningful citizen input into the selection process. The  city got off on the wrong foot when the city coordinator announced he took the  responsibility of beginning contract negotiations with head hunters  (recruiters) to begin the selection process without any citizen input. Oops. Maybe  I&rsquo;m mistaken. Maybe there was citizen input, just not African American citizen  input. This city desperately needs citizen participation from all groups in the  selection of the next chief of the department, participation that needs to be  done in an honest and forthright manner.</p>
