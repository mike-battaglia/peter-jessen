  Subject: RE: [NIE] Digest Number 214</p>
<p><em> The NIE issue for Tuesday, 11-18-02, urges us to read the article in the 
  11-18-02 Strib, &#8220;NAACP election highlights differences in beliefs.&#8221; 
  It is good to read every side. But &#8220;buyer beware.&#8221; This article is 
  misleading at best and untruthful at worst. It seems to me that in light of 
  the recent series on the NAACP in the Spokesman-Recorder, and in light of the 
  recent book by Ron Edwards, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, the article 
  suggested for reading, http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/3438182.html needs 
  a closer look. The article obviously quotes both candidates. From the quotes, 
  it is clear that both have read the Table of Contents of Ron&#8217;s book if not the 
  whole book (as Ron wrote the book I know he, at least, has read it). That the 
  article is misleading is nothing new, and indeed that is one of Ron&#8217;s themes 
  about the mainstream press. It is interesting to note that although the Strib 
  has had a copy of the book for three weeks for review and comment, it has yet 
  to write about it. That has been left to the Spokesman Recorder (see reviews 
  and story on our Web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com and a forthcoming piece 
  in Insight). From the mainstream press: silence. For example, the article states 
  that:</em></p>
<p> Ron Edwards stands for: &#8220;a return to basics to recapture and regain respect 
  in the community&#8221;</p>
<p> Shalia Lindsey stands for: the group&#8217;s &#8220;reestablishing its community 
  presence&#8221; on issues such as affordable housing, education and federal mediation.</p>
<p> What concerns me is that the line attributed to Ron makes him sound out of 
  touch whereas the line attributed to Shaila makes her sound very much in touch. 
  And yet it is the opposite that is true. What is listed under Shaila in terms 
  of what it means is not on the record anywhere whereas these topics are dealt 
  with by Ron, with a resoundingly profound chapter on each, along with his suggestions 
  for how to deal with them, in his book (for example, he addresses housing in 
  Chapter 8, education in Chapter 7, and mediation in Chapter 16). </p>
<p> Also, Lindsey&#8217;s statement that the local branch redistricting would have &#8220;helped 
  more people of color win City Council seats&#8221; is shockingly untrue. The 
  travesty of the collusion of the NAACP to disempower, disenfranchise and impoverish 
  the Black community is clearly explained in Ron&#8217;s book, in Chapters 12 and 13, 
  with an explanation of gerrymandering in Interlude 12. And how can Lindsey claim &#8220;restoring the stability and integrity of the organization&#8221; when the 
  NAACP, according to a recent article earlier this month, is so out of touch 
  that despite the tens of thousands of Blacks in Minneapolis, its membership 
  numbers less than 200? </p>
<p> And to open up the article with &#8220;It has all the makings of an intergenerational 
  struggle,&#8221; clearly takes away the significant substantive positions where 
  Ron has courageously taken stands that should make all the readers of the NIE 
  proud. Instead, the article casts the election differences as merely trivial, 
  of a young person underdog vs. an over the hill guy, so why not give it to the 
  young underdog? This is very unfair. Age is not the issue. Substance is. Equal 
  access is. Equal opportunity is. The prize of freedom is. The only real promise 
  for progress for Blacks which I&#8217;ve seen in Minneapolis or in any other city 
  in this country is in Ron&#8217;s book. He summarizes his suggestions in Chapter 17. 
  He trumpets his positive and optimistic vision in his Conclusion. He calls for 
  all, young and old, Black and White, rich and poor, clergy and lay people, neighbor 
  and neighbor, voters and the voted for, to apply the Golden Rule to each other 
  (see Chapter 5).</p>
<p> When Ron is quoted in the article saying &#8220;&#8221;I&#8217;ve been here. I don&#8217;t 
  see an implementation of the mission statement of the NAACP or the stipulations 
  from the two lawsuits,&#8221; he speaks truth, which he backs up in his book 
  in Chapter 14, where he discusses why the NAACP is no longer a force to be reckoned 
  with. What should be done? Ron lays it out clearly and nicely in Chapters 5 
  and 17. Ron can bring the grace of age (he believes in and practices Minnesota 
  Nice but makes the understandable demand that it be made to apply to Blacks 
  as well as to Whites, to the poor as well as to the non-poor, to the young as 
  well as the old). He represents one who can bridge the generations and be a 
  catalyst to raise up a new generation of leaders, not to follow him, but to 
  be empowered by the organization to go out in the community and city itself, 
  without pausing to consider whether they have to ask permission to do so (see 
  the eloquent statements in earlier issues of the NIE to that effect by the young 
  Black candidate for governor who was told by the older Black leadership that 
  he had to get permission from them first: those words will never cross the lips 
  of Ron Edwards). </p>
<p> Beacon On The Hill Press applauds your efforts and discussions. As the publisher 
  of Ron&#8217;s book, we would be remiss if we didn&#8217;t acknowledge the significance 
  we place in his book. It is not often a publisher has an opportunity to bring 
  to the public a book that is destined to be a classic, a book that has the potential 
  to make a positive impact on the domestic issues of this country today, a book 
  that has all of the ingredients of a recipe for healing and reconciliation between 
  the races and prosperity for all races by providing first a catharsis by stating 
  the awful and sometimes terrifying truths and then closing with positive suggestions 
  for positive possibilities for everyone, a book that should be in the home of 
  everyone in every city in America. Whether you elect Ron or not is the collective 
  decision of those voters who show up and are allowed to vote. Regardless, Ron 
  has written the blue print for showing White Minneapolis why and how &#8220;to 
  let my people go&#8221; and how Black Minneapolis can work together to make that 
  happen for all. Keep your eye on the prize. Work for freedom, liberty, and prosperity 
  for all, not just a few. Our prayers and best wishes are for you in this moment 
  of decision of yours. </p>
<p> For those who want to learn more, I will take the unusual step later today 
  of placing the Table of Contents of the book on our web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com. 
  You can then easily order the book on line from our site, or purchase copies 
  at the Ruminator Book Store at 11th and Washington in downtown Minneapolis or 
  at the Spokesman-Recorder newspaper office. Over the next several weeks the 
  book will become available in other book stores as well. </p>
<p> Show you care. Regardless of how and who you vote for, vote, and show through 
  your numbers you are ready to bring the NAACP and, by extension, the Black people 
  of Minneapolis as well, back to glory.</p>
<p> Tune in, turn out, and vote.<br>
