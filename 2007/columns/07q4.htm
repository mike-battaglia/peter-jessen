<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>In this Christmas/Kwanza season of 2007, we celebrate the gifts to our community 
  by heroes of our community, and challenge the unheroic to be heroic, as we look 
  at some of the high and low marks in the social agenda of the people of America, 
  and specifically the people of Minnesota. We'd like to think that one of the 
  strengths of a society that is a democracy is that we have heroes, good people, 
  those who give us the gift of speaking out for the causes of justice and goodness, 
  those that fight for righteousness.  </p>
<p>But then sometimes we begin to have doubts. And then you pull out the Honor 
  Roll, and you realize yes, Margaret, there are still heroes in America. </p>
<p>And so we dedicate this year-end column to those quiet, anonymous heroes of 
  the day.  </p>
<p>Like <strong>Roosevelt Gaines</strong>, who for 30 years as an employee of 
  the Urban League of Minneapolis has fought the passionate and yet often thankless 
  job of finding jobs for our people, particularly in the field of construction.</p>
<p>And then you have <strong>Joe Boone</strong>,a Black general contractor who, 
  for over 30 years, has toiled in a very competitive field of construction as 
  an owner and contractor, a man who, a couple of years ago, put his business 
  career on the line by successfully suing the City of Minneapolis and others 
  for racial discrimination in the trades. </p>
<p>And then you have <strong>Lester Hall</strong>, a Black contractor who has 
  fought the City to a standstill in his attempt to open the door of inclusion 
  for all.  </p>
<p>And then you have the group of <strong>Black women </strong> who have fought 
  the University of Minnesota and the City of Minneapolis to a standstill over 
  the building of a still-questionable research center in North Minneapolis for 
  which there remain unanswered questions. </p>
<p>And then you have those <strong>Black men and women </strong> who have raised 
  questions about education and who have faced off against the Minneapolis Board 
  of Education.  </p>
<p>And then you have a group who no one saw coming and no one expected who have 
  challenged the status quo of racism and nullification: <strong>five very courageous 
  police officers </strong> who, in filing their lawsuit on December 3, 2007, 
  brought into clear focus the culture of racism and nullification that has permeated 
  the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD).  </p>
<p>The issues that they laid out, the allegations that they have made under the 
  rule of law, have sent a tidal wave across this city and state -- in fact, across 
  this nation and foreign countries, because we can tell you that the American 
  Bar Association Law Review and the Canadian Broadcasting System and other major 
  American publications are now examining the lawsuit and the allegations contained 
  therein. </p>
<p>There had been warnings prior to December 3, one by a White lieutenant of the 
  MPD whose career was dealt a blow when he was relieved of command because he 
  exposed the reverse tidal wave of nullification, reversal and racism in the 
  department. <strong>Michael Keith </strong> is his name. The Black Police Officers 
  remember him, and that's a good thing.  </p>
<p>And then there was the <strong>White female officer </strong> of the Minneapolis 
  Park Police who was reprimanded because she did not shoot a 14-year-old Black 
  student at Anderson Middle School.  </p>
<p>We also recognize our heroes serving in the <strong>military</strong>, and 
  <strong>service workers </strong> who work to make sure we get our water and 
  heat and electricity. </p>
<p>These, my friends, are the kinds of heroes who give hope that the democratic 
  institutions of our society will attempt to maintain a steady course toward 
  justice and fairness and corrective action; and so, in some respects, '07 was 
  a very good year, while in other respects, '07 was the year of uncertainty whether 
  the glass is half full or half empty.  </p>
<p><strong>We address the half-full/half-empty question in a 3,000-word essay 
  on our website (<a href="../blogs/0712dec.htm#0736b1214">see 12-14-07 blog entry #36</a>)</strong>, and that raises the question 
  of who has not been heroic. Our nominees for <strong>un-heroic</strong> <strong>non-heroes 
  </strong> (unless you want to honor <strong>heroes of nullification and reversal</strong>) are Chief <strong>Tim Dolan</strong>, Mayor <strong>R.T. </strong><strong>Rybak 
  </strong>, and City Civil Rights Department Director <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, a trifecta  of not only racism and discrimination, but also 
  of powerful men pretending to be victims while they themselves victimize others 
  with their racism and discrimination.  </p>
<p><strong>Chief Dolan: </strong> You have been with the department for 22 years. 
  You not only know its racist side, you have long been a part of it. <strong>Mayor 
  Rybak:</strong> you inaugurated your first term by trying to eliminate 
  the civilian panel established to review the work of the police. And Civil Rights 
  Director <strong>Michael Jordan:</strong>  you continue to bring shame 
  with your lying and your playing the role of Mr. Charlie, denying Blacks their 
  civil rights by pushing every so-called special interest group minority ahead 
  of Blacks. </p>
<p>These are the mini-minded-mini-men-of-Miniville. Minneapolis doesn't need leaders 
  driving while looking through the rearview mirror. </p>
<p>Only time and you will be able to make the half-full/half-empty judgment. So, 
  as we move toward 2008, the battle will continue, and in this column we will 
  continue to bring you the information and the facts. It is the right thing to 
  do. </p>
<p>Have a blessed Christmas/Kwansa season. Give your children a hug and pray for 
  the survival of Black America. In fact, pray for all of America. </p>

  The Stiffing of OIC: </strong><strong>Louis King and Steve Cramer Betrayed </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>In the early Spring of this year, Louis King, the Chief Executive Officer of 
  <a href="http://www.oicofamerica.org" target="_blank">OIC (Opportunities Industrialization 
  Centers</a>) felt that opportunity to be involved in the construction of the 
  Twins stadium.  </p>
<p>Mr. King knew, from previous history, that he was taking both a professional 
  and a political chance, but Steve Cramer, the Chairman of the Baseball Authority, 
  was equally confident that this thing, full and gainful employment for African 
  American workers on the Twins baseball stadium could be done. </p>
<p>The general contractor is M.A. Mortenson, assured Mr. Cramer and the Baseball 
  Authority and Mr. King and OIC, that they were all pulling in the right direction. 
   </p>
<p>If there was ever a misrepresentation of fact, it was the false assurances 
  by M.A. Mortenson that diversity is the order of the day.  In fact, Mr. 
  King was being treated so badly, that the Hennepin County Board, a couple of 
  weeks ago, took away $186,000 in training money from OIC's Hardhat Program. 
</p>
<p>Only after Mr. King made a personal appeal did the County Board of Commissioners 
  restore about $150,000.  In the meantime, in a very confidential report 
  to Mr. Cramer, OIC laid out a chilling set of circumstances that has led to, 
  at best, only one African American being employed on the Twins stadium site. 
</p>
<p>And guess who is the prime obstructionist besides M.A. Mortenson?  That 
  right.  The Minneapolis Civil Rights Department, that reported to the 
  Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission that the Department had just signed a lucrative 
  contract with the Baseball Authority to monitor the stadium construction.  </p>
<p>In a meeting about a week and a half ago, all of the principals came together, 
  including Michael Jordan's Civil Rights Department.  Louis King laid out 
  in detail the violations that were occurring and which were an outgrowth of 
  M.A. Mortenson's resistance to diversity and compliance.  </p>
<p>On November 21, 2007, OIC spelled out to Steve Cramer the resistance and the 
  reversal by M.A. Mortenson to diversity.  </p>
<p>Now you have to understand that this is the same M.A. Mortenson, acting as 
  the general contractor for the Gophers football stadium, that essentially made 
  it clear that Blacks need not apply for employment.  </p>
<p>The City of Minneapolis has taken the position that that is acceptable, and 
  has declined to challenge the University of Minnesota or M.A. Mortenson's continued 
  participation in the nullification and reversal of the Civil Rights Act of the 
  City of Minneapolis. </p>
<p>To the credit of Louis King of OIC, and Steve Cramer of the Minnesota Baseball 
  Authority, they have held these violations as unacceptable.  </p>
<p>But unfortunately for Mr. Cramer and the Baseball Authority, they have entered 
  into a contract with the City of Minneapolis and its Civil Rights Department 
  that apparently is only concerned with maintaining the status quo of segregation, 
  the nullification and reversal of civil rights.  </p>
<p>The City of Minneapolis is saying that you can pay to go the game when the 
  stadium is completed, but we'll be damned if we'll fight for  you to work 
  on it as it is being  built. </p>
<p>Remember what we reported a couple of months ago, that Minneapolis City officials 
  have said you can complete any project you want and not hire a single African 
  American and still meet the diversity requirements, and its OK with them.  Diversity, in other words, is becoming the new word for segregation. </p>
<p><strong>Update on MPD </strong></p>
<p>Las Vegas and the lastest MPD cover up:  even though a Black female civilian 
  employee of the MPD <a href="http://www.dailymole.com/wordpress/2007/12/06/minneapolis-police-officer-under-investigation-for-sexual-assault-in-another-city" target="_blank">reported 
  to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</a> that late on a Thursday 
  night, early on a Friday morning, she was a victim of a sexual assault by white 
  MPD officers in a hotel room in Las Vegas, the MPD has worked to silence her 
  and carry out the big cover up.  Check out Steve Perry's web site, the 
  daily mole, December 7, 2007.  He broke the story wide open, while the 
  Strib and the MPD remain silent. </p>
<p><strong>New Promotions </strong></p>
<p>Chief Dolan has promoted three new white Lieutenants.  What was interesting 
  is that none of the three were on the Lieutenant's promotion list.  We 
  wonder why.  Oh I'm sorry.  We know the anwer.  The leading 
  candidate, the number one candidate on the list, is an African American sergeant 
  with the initials of AK.  Oh yes, and what about the Asian officer whose 
  name showed up as appointed to Lieutenant and then bumped down to sergeant after 
  the Duy Ngo settlement? </p>
<p>His name wasn't <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12578176.html?page=1&c=y" target="_blank">Vang</a>, 
  was it?  They said it was a "typographical error."  </p>
<p>Is this punishment for the Asian contingent for applauding too loudly when 
  their beloved brother and comrade in arms received <a href="http://articles.citypages.com/2007-12-05/news/unfriendly-fire" target="_blank">$4.5 
  million for his injuries</a>?  We hope not.  After all, the Chief 
  and Mayor says there is no racism, no racial animus in this police dept.  What was the word they used?  Oh yes, coincidence. </p>
<p><strong>Liar liar response to law suit </strong></p>
<p>Just as the Jim Carrey character in the movie "Liar Liar" could not lie, the 
  city seems unable to tell the truth.  See our web log entry  <a href="../blogs/0712dec.htm#0736b1214">12-14-07, Blog #36:  The Twin Towers of Minneapolis' Nullification 
  and Reversal Begin to Finally Crumble as 5 Black Officers Sue the City for discrimination</a>  for more details about the City's blame game and playing "victim" and 
   how it uses "diversity" as the new segregation. </p>

  The Betrayal of Joan Johnson: A Civil Rights Tragedy </strong><strong>2. Black 
  police officers sue city and chief for discrimination</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>When <strong>Joan Johnson</strong>, the Chief Executive Officer and owner 
  of  Joan's Minority Owned Supplier, hereafter identified as J-MOS, became 
  enrolled in the Small Underutilized Business Program, referred to as SUBP, she 
  was led to believe that the City Civil Rights Department and the SUBP program 
  were there to help contractors of color. </p>
<p>In April of this year, when the City of Minneapolis' purchasing department 
  published the successful bids for the construction of sidewalks, alleys, curbs 
  and gutters, J-MOS was informed that J-MOS would be a prime  subcontractor/supplier 
  for Standard Sidewalk, Inc., operating from a post office box in Blaine, Mn, 
  but is shown to have corporate offices in Chisawgo County.  Joan's company 
  is also referred to as JMB  (Joan's Minority Business). </p>
<p>But by late May 2007, Ms. Johnson had not heard anything.  No wonder. 
   We have discovered that rather than contact J-MOS, Standard Sidewalk, 
  in the second week of May, 2007, emailed the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department 
  to announce that they had reversed their postion and would not use J-MOS, but 
  would award the $900 contract to another firm.  As the overall contract 
  was for $699,899.75, the $900 is .01% of the contract, far below the required 
  5% goal.   </p>
<p>In July of 2007, an official of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department emailed 
  Standard Sidewalk as well as officials in the City of Minneapolis' purchasing 
  department, that this created a serious problem, stating, and I quote:  "we have to discuss this issue as JMB's complaint won't go away, especially 
  after you again placed heir name legally on that bid that was approved by us 
  and the city's purchasing department.  The go signal for your company 
  on the city sidewalk project was done because of your statement."  A city 
  official then requested an immediate meeting to be held July 25, 2007, at 2 
  p.m., at the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights. </p>
<p>The only problem with that scenario was that a formal complaint had already 
  been filed by a 3 rd party, alleging a civil rights violation against Standard 
  Sidewalk.  Consequently there were serious ethical issues with respect 
  to such a meeting, which was presided over by the person who is now the Deputy 
  Director of the Civil Rights Dept.  </p>
<p>In fact, Standard Sidewalk was encouraged and guided in filing a formal complaint 
  against Joan Johnson of J-MOS, making the preposterous statement that J -MOS 
  serves "no commercially useful function."  This is an allegation that 
  has serious legal ramifications that can be a contract killer, a strategy that 
  has been used by other white contractors to eliminate sub-contractors of color 
  from the SUBP program.  </p>
<p>In their letter to Michael Jordan, the Director of the Minneapolis Civil Rights 
  Department in the first week of August 2007, Standard Sidewalk made allocations 
  that were both slanderous and unsubstantiated, and which ran very contrary to 
  correspondence the Civil Rights Department received from J-MOS in both May and 
  July of  2007. </p>
<p>In her correspondence of July, Ms. Johnson identified her suppliers, her relationship 
  with the SUBP program, her lisings and contracts with the Cities of Minneapolis 
  and St. Paul, and the Counties of Hennepin and Ramsey, and with the state of 
  Minnesota.  </p>
<p>A second letter in August, five days before Standard Sidewalk sent its letter, 
  the Civil Rights Department declared specifically that J-MOS was not a commercially 
  useful functioning enterprise.  Unknown to Ms. Johnson and her firm, individuals 
  within the Civil Rights Dept had begun a  process to remove J-MOS from 
  the list of approved companies from the city's certification list </p>
<p>In their letter of the first week of August, and I quote, "as pointed out by 
  Marvin Taylor at our meeting of July 25, 2007, Standard Sidewalk has partnered 
  with the City of Minneapolis going back many, many seasons.  We value 
  this relationship and hope to work for the City on many projects to come." </p>
<p>What is chilling about that statement was the email from the Civil Rights Department 
  on July 19, 2007, 12:32 p.m., which stated the complainent firm JMB won't go 
  away.    </p>
<p>But it appears to the naked eye that arrangements were made, and in the letter 
  of August 6, 2007, Standard Sidewalk indicated their appreciation for the problem 
  going away and of J-MOS disappearing from the American landscape. </p>
<p>Incidentally, just a week and a half ago, Standard Sidewalk was the recipient 
  of another large contract from the City of Minneapolis, with the Minneapolis 
  Civil Rights Department saying that Standard Sidewalk was a business in good 
  standing.  How interesting.  </p>
<p>On March 8, 2007, three white firms received over $2.3 million in contracts, 
  and not a single one of them met their minority and women's goals.  Joan, 
  with friends like this, you don't need any enemies.  Stay turned. </p>
<p><strong>Black Police Officers Take A Stand </strong></p>
<p>As this column hits the news stands to press, two recent stories about one 
  of Homicide's best, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/10241/story/1579845.html" target="_blank">Sgt 
  Adams</a>, and his reassignment and the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/10241/story/1582254.html" target="_blank">outcry 
  against that action of the MPD</a>, provide helpful backdrop to explain why, 
  two days ago, Monday, December 3, 2007, high-ranking members of the Black Police 
  Officers Association <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12081986.html" target="_blank">filed 
  the largest discrimination law suit in the history of the city of Minneapolis</a>, 
  "sueing the Minneapolis Police Department and its chief Monday over allegations 
  of systemic racial discrimination and a hostile working environment." Congratulations. 
  Our next column will provide more details. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0724c1121" id="0701c5"></a>November 21, 2007 Column #24: </strong><strong>Foundation 
  in place to begin 'research' genocide&#8212;again </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>Last week, preparation began at the corner of Plymouth and Penn for the construction 
  of Dr. Frankenstein's dream research center, which should be completed and up 
  and running by late summer 2008. </p>
<p>After much maneuvering, back-room politics and payoffs, the University of Minnesota 
  Board of Regents has authorized the beginning of this Great Racial Experiment. 
  Dr. Dante Cicchetti and his associates are in place. The roundup of the usual 
  suspects, Black children, will mark the program. </p>
<p>Also note that the Northside YMCA at North Commons was quietly shut down and 
  boarded up for "rehab." In the future, families with children will be referred 
  to this new incubator center at NorthPoint for processing before being moved 
  to the research center.  </p>
<p>Many do not realize that this is not the first time the University of Minnesota 
  has conducted questionable experimental research involving African Americans. 
   </p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, a very courageous Black woman, Elizabeth Samuels, sounded 
  the alert regarding a dangerous research project on sickle cell anemia conducted 
  by the University of Minnesota and the American Red Cross. Samuels was a community 
  advocate and a community specialist located at Phyllis Wheatley Community Center. 
</p>
<p>There was some Negro leadership who suggested that experimental medical research 
  directed toward the African American community should not be questioned. It 
  was questioned by the late Dr. Thomas Johnson and other prominent African American 
  physicians of Minneapolis, who mounted a significant challenge to protest this 
  sickle cell project, raising questions about its purpose.  </p>
<p>In fact, TV stations and the local newspapers reported on picketing and other 
  protests outside the American Red Cross offices in Minneapolis and outside medical 
  facilities of the University of Minnesota. They requested that data pertaining 
  to the project be released. Their request was denied.  </p>
<p>Once the American Red Cross realized that Samuels was the source of the information, 
  they initiated a retaliatory action that led to her termination and the end 
  of her career. She paid a severe price for her honesty, integrity, and commitment 
  to humanity. </p>
<p>Some aspects of the investigation were so embarrassing that the University 
  of Minnesota and the American Red Cross eventually promised, in a written agreement, 
  that they would do more due diligence on the sickle cell project.  </p>
<p>That due diligence lasted about two years. With Samuels gone, Black physicians 
  under attack, the precedent of retaliation established, and the Black community 
  moving on to deal with other issues, it was back to business as usual. </p>
<p>Now, 30 years later, the university and the medical community get another shot 
  at experimental medicine that others consider medical genocide and medical apartheid 
  against the African American community. </p>
<p>As the crews began preparing the site for the new medical Dachau last week, 
  we realized that those engaged in experimental medicine with good intentions 
  that get bad results against the interests of humanity were back in business. 
  Again using the Black population as guinea pigs, Dr. Frankenstein's disdain 
  and disrespect for the African American community resurfaces. </p>
<p>In 1980 I worked with Dick Gregory, who exposed a very dangerous project that 
  involved the then-little-known HIV virus (later reported in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Journey-Source-HIV-AIDS/dp/0316371378/ref=pd_bbs_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195200067&sr=8-6" target="_blank">1999 
  book <em>The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS</em></a>, by Edward Hooper and Bill 
  Hamilton). </p>
<p>In these polio vaccine experiments in the Congo (and later in New Jersey and 
  San Francisco), serum from infected primates was given to Congolese (in the 
  U.S. it was given either to handicapped children or newborns at prisons and 
  hospitals), in a demonstration of the casual racism of the day. A program on 
  this that Dick Gregory, Bill Cosby and I were going to host in Minneapolis was 
  killed by our local Black ministerial leadership.  </p>
<p>The <em><a href="http://www.startribune.com/484/story/1535995.html" target="_blank">Star 
  Tribune </a></em><a href="http://www.startribune.com/484/story/1535995.html" target="_blank">reported November 
  7</a> a story from Dar Es-Salaam, Tanzania, about the scientific <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2004001162_stepvaccine08m.html" target="_blank">conference 
  in Seattle </a>two weeks ago, reporting that a vaccine trial was stopped as 
  it increased the risk of AIDS in some who had been exposed, rather than preventing 
  it. Some of the trials were <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16257494" target="_blank">held 
  in South Africa.</a></p>
<p><strong>Uncalled-for punishment in MPS </strong></p>
<p>A valiant effort is underway by a dedicated group of citizens, predominantly 
  Black, who are developing a covenant to deal with the future education of the 
  African American child in a very hard-hitting approach that will be considered 
  historic and of national importance. </p>
<p>The document will thoroughly test the commitment and direction of the board 
  and administration of the Minneapolis Public Schools Special District #1. </p>
<p>The organizers will be announcing specific language over the coming weeks. 
  In light of the report by the McKinsey Group to the MPS Board of Education about 
  10 days ago, and in light of the escalation of Black students to the new disciplinary 
  program at Olson Middle School, and in light of the fact that principals are 
  being told that they are not meeting their quotas in referring African American 
  students to these disciplinary programs, we desperately need somebody to step 
  forward with a program, with a plan, that has both impact and solution. </p>
<p>We applaud this group. Stay tuned. </p>

<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>Do you recall delicate conversations with others about how it sometimes seems 
  that the life of Black children in the Minneapolis Public Schools are little 
  valued or appreciated? We have heard them too. </p>
<p>These are not rumors. These are not speculation. They are true. </p>
<p>It is difficult for many, regardless of their race, to believe that there is 
  such hatred and disdain for Black people in this city that it extends to children 
  also. But it does. When we are offered proof, it is our journalistic responsibility 
  to move the truth forward. </p>
<p>There is a 13-year-old Black student of Anderson Middle School sleeping peacefully 
  tonight because of the professionalism and objectivity of a 27-year-veteran 
  of the Minneapolis Park Police. That child owes her his life. He and his parents 
  have no clue that the Park Police Command wish he had been shot dead instead. 
</p>
<p>Less than two weeks ago, an altercation took place in the cafeteria of Anderson 
  Middle School. A young Black student in the special education program, 13 years 
  of age but weighing 250 pounds, became unruly. As it is the park police that 
  provide security for the public schools, this Park Board police officer answered 
  the call. </p>
<p>She and the assistant principal brought the young boy under control; he lightly 
  brushed the officer's neck area as she successfully defended herself. He was 
  arrested and taken into custody. </p>
<p>The child pleaded guilty to forth degree simple assault. But, it was the aftermath 
  that sent the chilling message reaffirming the danger that children of color 
  face in their relationship with the security forces hired by the Minneapolis 
  Public Schools. </p>
<p>This near-30-year Park Board officer was written up and, according to reliable 
  sources, <em>reprimanded for not using lethal force </em>. Think about that: 
  She was reprimanded for not discharging her weapon in a cafeteria filled with 
  children. This is how deep the racism runs in the Park Police. </p>
<p>Rather than receive praise for safely bringing a situation under control, the 
  officer was told that she froze, that she should have pulled her weapon and 
  blown this "Black bastard" away.   </p>
<p>This officer challenged the reprimand and the Park Police top command's logic 
  and rationale. </p>
<p>Do not try, Park Board commissioners, to pass this off as rumor. It happened. 
  We know. In fact, it took communication between the city attorney's office, 
  the female park police officer, and, apparently, the Police Federation, to effect 
  the rescinding of the reprimand and the order that the officer retake a course 
  in how to use deadly force.  </p>
<p>Understand that this means she was being reprimanded for <em>not </em> shooting 
  this 13-year-old child in a cafeteria full of children, teachers, administrators 
  and teachers' aides. The tradition of the doctrine of Justice Taney is alive 
  and well in the commander of the park police -- that an African American child 
  has no rights that Whites are duty bound, legally bound, or morally bound to 
  respect. </p>
<p>Will public officials be angry that this happened? No. They will be angry because 
  the information got out. There will be no ongoing discussion or debate against 
  the policy that says lethal force is appropriate against a Black child under 
  any and all circumstances.  </p>
<p>For you Black parents with children in the Minneapolis Public Schools, give 
  your babies a hug and a kiss and pray that they will be able to survive what 
  is supposedly an educational journey in an environment of absolute safety. </p>
<p><strong>Construction of the bridge </strong></p>
<p>"Blacks Need Not Apply For Jobs." Again. </p>
<p>That was the message last week when a major bridge-building corporation from 
  Colorado began the first stages to reconstruct the bridge that fell across the 
  Mississippi. Just like the baseball and football stadiums, the bridge joins 
  that infamous noncompliance Hall of Shame.  </p>
<p>Do it. Build it. Make shareholder profit. And don't worry: Our City has officially 
  defined minorities such that you don't have to hire Black folk. Why do federal, 
  state, county and city officials stay silent instead of fighting for the right 
  of African Americans to walk through the doors of opportunity on these projects? 
</p>
<p>Why are violence and homicides called violations when the laws, ordinances, 
  and rules used to discriminate against our opportunities are not called violations? 
   </p>
<p>This is how the agents and the designers of racism are able to legally carry 
  out their successful program of nullification and reversal. They act as if we 
  Black folk are invisible, nonentities, non-franchised, without meaningful constitutional 
  rights.   </p>
<p>Business as usual. Suffering continues. Dreams are unmet. They fill the penitentiaries 
  and graveyards with us. Our leaders continue to eat fried chicken, drink champagne, 
  and pretend that we shall overcome when they mean just themselves.  </p>
<p>My friends, you live in a metropolitan area in which the civil and human rights 
  of the African American are nullified and reversed, all under the guise that 
  Black folks just aren't that important, and that their children have no right 
  to a future -- or to even exist.  </p>
<p>May God continue to pray for Black Minnesotans. Sometimes it seems as if he 
  is the only one who does. </p>

  great warrior takes his final journey home. Go in peace, Brother Vernon, on 
  your flight to the Spirit World </strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>Vernon Bellecourt came into this life born WaBun-Inini -- Man of Dawn, in Ojibwa 
  -- on October 17, 1931, on Minnesota's White Earth reservation, where unemployment 
  was 95 percent when he was growing up. He moved to Minneapolis when he was 16. 
   </p>
<p>Read tributes <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/14/bellecourtobit/" target="_blank">[Minnesota 
  Public Radio]</a>,  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/sports/17bellecourt.html?_r=1&em&ex=1192766400&en=1082f94d88e0781f&ei=5087%0A&oref=slogin" target="_blank">[New

  Observer]</a>,  and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301613,00.html" target="_blank">[Fox 
News]</a>.  </p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.dickshovel.com/belle.html" target="_blank">1995 Interview 
  of Vernon</a>. </p>
<p>For most of his life, Vernon was a true and consummate warrior fighting not 
  only the battles of his beloved people, but sitting at the table with world 
  leaders in his role as a "diplomat for justice" (as stated in a UN piece) fighting 
  the battle for the world's disenfranchised. His funeral was October 17, 2007. 
</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of knowing Vernon for over 35 years. He co-founded AIM (American 
  Indian Movement) in 1968 and served as AIM negotiator at the 1972 occupation 
  of the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters in Washington, D.C., as part of 
  the Trail of Broken Treaties caravan. </p>
<p>He was with Jesse Jackson in Operation Push in Chicago in 1973. In 1974, under 
  United Nations auspices, Vernon helped organize an international conference 
  on the rights of native peoples. We intoned "We shall overcome" alongside the 
  American Indian's "We shall overrun." </p>
<p>The <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune </em><a href="http://www.startribune.com/466/story/1483509.html" target="_blank">paid 
  appropriate and well-deserved recognition </a>to this great man on October 15. 
</p>
<p>Some who came to his wake at All Nations Church in South Minneapolis were government 
  officials from such African countries as Ghana and Libya, paying their respects 
  to a man who has now taken flight to the Spirit World, a sign of the respect 
  and admiration for him  around the world.  </p>
<p>It was heartwarming to see former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton at his wake. Other 
  politicians were notable in their absence.  </p>
<p>As president of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media, Vernon 
  reminded everyone that Indians were people, not mascots or artifacts (protesting 
  the tens of thousands of skeletal remains of American Indians held at various 
  universities, anthropological centers and museums, and thus denied burial). 
   </p>
<p>Truly we "pass this way" but once. To come this way and do nothing for humanity 
  nor your people is to forfeit your right and claim to a legacy. Vernon Bellecourt 
  leaves a legacy rich in achievements, success and caring.  </p>
<p>It is in the context of extreme U.S. government repression of the American 
  Indian Movement that Vernon and other indigenous leaders are best appreciated. 
  He became an internationalist and was a founder of the International Indian 
  Treaty Council, a staunch advocate, supporter and speaker for indigenous peoples 
  around the world. </p>
<p>He understandably sought help wherever he could find it. Although reviled in 
  Minnesota, he sat with leaders of international importance, such as Nelson Mandela 
  and Bishop Desmond Tutu.  Vernon was loved around the world, where he 
  supported all indigenous people, including the Irish, Venezuelan, Cuban, Libyan, 
  Nicaraguan, Palestinian, etc. </p>
<p>His first trip to see a foreign leader was in 1989, to Libya, when he met with 
  Col. Qaddafi, who pledged a billion dollars for American Indians -- which the 
  U.S. government didn't allow.<br>
  <br>
  Unable to obtain free or cheap heating oil for our Indian reservations here, 
  he got it from Venezuelan President Hugo Chaves. It was partly by meeting with 
  controversial foreign figures like Libya's Col. Muammar el-Qadafi, Yasir Arafat, 
  Chavez, etc., that Vernon was able to gain international recognition for Indian 
  nations and their treaties. </p>
<p>Vernon Bellecourt, this humble son of Minnesota, sat at the table of international 
  power. His council and wisdom were sought by those who walked the international 
  stage in the fight for freedom. Vernon loved his people and was displeased with 
  anyone who had no caring for those considered to be the least of our citizens, 
  particularly the children of the world.  </p>
<p>As we have pointed out in this column, Vernon fought against the use of despicable 
  Indian names for sports teams. In this regard, not many will forget his arrest 
  in October 1997, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the discomfort he brought on Ted Turner 
  and Jane Fonda as they did the "tomahawk chop" at Atlanta Braves games.  </p>
<p>But it was his concern for the future of the world's children that brought 
  an even greater demand for his counsel and for his wisdom. </p>
<p>Some forget that not every private citizen gets asked to address the United 
  Nations, as did Vernon. At the time, Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega probably 
  said it best when he called Vernon Bellecourt the most compelling spokesman 
  for the indigenous people of the world. </p>
<p>Vernon Bellecourt will be missed on the local and world stages. You only pass 
  this way once, and to have come and seen and said nothing will guarantee a bleak 
  recollection and remembrance of your presence. But to have come, to have seen, 
  to have spoken, and to have reached out to make a difference, to make a change, 
  and to provide hope accords Vernon the right to be called forever one of the 
  great warriors on the long and unbroken civil rights trail on behalf of his 
  people. </p>
<p>Go in peace, our brother, and may you be greeted by the giants of our time, 
  yesterday and today. </p>

<p><strong><a name="0721c1010" id="0701c5"></a>October 10, 2007 Column #21: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1463394.html" target="_blank">Shame 
  on U of St. Thomas for silencing free speech</a></strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Through My Eyes, the Minneapolis Story Continues...&#8221;<br>
A weekly column by Ron Edwards featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a> </em></p>
<p>Last spring, Cris Toffolo, associate professor at St. Thomas University and 
  chair of the Peace Studies Department, supported inviting South Africa's Nobel 
  Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu to speak at St. Thomas in April of 2008. 
  Rather than respond with joy and positive reflection, St. Thomas "scuttled" 
  the visit and relieved her of being Peace chair (for supporting the visit and 
  for letting Bishop Tutu know, on Peace Studies letterhead, that there was a 
  problem due to pressure from the Jewish community).    </p>
<p>The great Jewish traditions support democracy (Deuteronomy 1), oppose the rule 
  of kings or dictators (I Samuel 8), and speak the Exodus liberation mantra, 
  "Let my people go." And, it was a Jew who gave us the Golden Rule. How shameful 
  for those claiming to represent a people historically denied free speech, and 
  whose books and people were burned, to characterize speech of a peace advocate 
  as "offensive and hurtful." </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> Bishop Tutu supports the state of Israel.  </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> He supports all people, including Palestinians, seeking 
  inclusivity rather than us/them.  </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> He succeeded in achieving the "truth and reconciliation" 
  in South Africa that helped end apartheid. </p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1463394.html" target="_blank">October 4, 2007, <em>Strib 
 </em>article</a>, Randy Furst makes it appear that the Jewish position was correct, faultless 
  and absolute. We respectfully disagree (free speech, remember?). Remember holocaust 
  denial? We also abhor apartheid denial, history denial, and opposing views denial. 
</p>
<p>Truth: In the 1970s and 1980s, with Nelson Mandela still imprisoned on Robbins 
  Island, Bishop Tutu exposed the USA and the state of Israel, its military, and 
  its intelligence services and their close working relationship with the obstructionist 
  and terroristic White apartheid regime of South Africa. </p>
<p>Truth: Bishop Tutu led the fight from a position of danger inside South Africa, 
  calling upon the world to support the <a href="http://www.horizonmag.com/8/leon-sullivan.asp" target="_blank">Sullivan 
  Principles (to train and hire Blacks)</a>. </p>
<p>Bishop Tutu revealed the sinister and evil plot of the Israeli government and 
  American corporations to sabotage the Sullivan Principles and continue supporting 
  apartheid. </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> We understand the USA supporting dictators who sided 
  with us against the USSR during the Cold War. But those days are over. Time 
  to move on.  </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> Bishop Tutu exposed the then evil and dangerous relationship 
  between South African, American and Israeli scientists in the development of 
  biological weapons to use, just in case, against the Black population of South 
  Africa and against the military operations of the ANC (African National Congress, 
  led by Nelson Mandela).  </p>
<p><strong>Truth: </strong> For those who desire to deny, we refer you to Congressional 
  testimony of both the 1980s and 1990s and their lists of South African, American 
  and Israeli corporations involved in this diabolical plan.  </p>
<p>St. Thomas attempts to silence a voice renowned worldwide for its dedication 
  and commitment to peace, truth and freedom, and instead embraces the voices 
  of reversal and nullification to silence truth, which include our silent Black 
  leadership and liberals. </p>
<p>Marv Davidov, a Jewish peace activist, represents the good in our community. 
  He speaks truth about the shame of silencing: "Stifling debate and dissent [and] 
  criticism of Israel is a disservice to all Jews, the state of Israel and the 
  American people." </p>
<p>Bishop Tutu has made a difference on the world stage, earning the Nobel Peace 
  Prize. St. Thomas has earned shame. God bless Bishop Tutu and his legacy, and 
  shame upon the Catholic University of St. Thomas, a school that needs to engage 
  truth and reconcile. </p>
<p>Bishop Tutu will speak at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul April 11-13, 
  2008. This is fitting and honors the legacy of Nellie Stone Johnson, who served 
  on the board of trustees of this university with campuses across Minnesota. 
</p>
<p><strong>We saw it coming </strong></p>
<p>Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and Minneapolis Police Dept. Chief Tim Dolan led 
  a delegation to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-08-30-violent-crimes_x.htm" target="_blank">a 
  gathering of 170 police chiefs, mayors</a>, and other government officials in 
  a suburb of Chicago to discuss how to reduce violent crime (<a href="http://www.startribune.com/crime/story/1454490.html" target="_blank"> 
  <em>Strib</em>, Sept 29</a>), including Chuck Wexler of the <a href="http://www.policeforum.org/singlenews.asp?item_ID=1633&comm=0" target="_blank">Police 
  Executive Research Forum </a>(who advises both Minneapolis and Israel on security 
  issues) was one of the prime organizers. Our mayor and chief offered "Crime 
  as a Public Health Issue." </p>
<p>The issue is not health. Let's review: Under the Patriot Act and other national 
  security provisions, lists have been prepared, roundup sites designated, and 
  special security units trained and developed. </p>
<p>Do you remember when the FBI was shamefully allowed to target Martin Luther 
  King, Jr.? Do you remember the shameful Tuskeegee experiments? Do you recall 
  our mantra about the shameful emergency regarding young Black males as a targeted 
  and endangered species? Is there a shameful new Ritalin for Black males? </p>
<p>Again, the issue is not health. The issue is whether or not to prepare young 
  men for jobs through education and whether to have families supported by community. 
   If the prime economic base, limited to a couple of thousand, is sports, 
  music, and selling drugs and rap songs, then your math reveals millions of young 
  Black men excluded from the equation for success. </p>
<p>Then you understand that some consider us Black Americans expendable. That's 
  what they really talked about in Chicago. </p>
