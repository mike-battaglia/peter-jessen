<p><STRONG>Sources tell us </STRONG><STRONG>Tracy Clayes </STRONG><STRONG>will&nbsp;be fired tomorrow, Jan 3</STRONG><BR>
<STRONG>Sources also say UM in violation of NCAA ruled for under the table negotiation with P.J. Fleck</STRONG></p>
<p>January 2, 2017, 10:18 p.m.</p>
<p>Negotiations have been going on with Western Michigan University Head Football Coach, P.J. Fleck, since early Nov or earlier, which is in violation of NCAA rules.&nbsp; It also indicates that despite Coach Clayes winning the Decembe 31, 2016 Holiday Bowl and having the best UM win-loss recordd in a decade, he was targeted some time ago for replacement because (1) UM wanted a fund raiigng coach and (2) Clayhes &nbsp;supposedly had no plan for dealing with the Negro players.</p>
<p>The cover up excuse for firing him was his comment when rape charges were made against ten of his players, all of whom claimed they were innocent.&nbsp; Coach Clayes said he supported his players.&nbsp; They were judged without due process </p>
<p>So, despite the facg that police said there were no charges to make, as the sex clearly was consensual, the UM allowed the charges anyway.&nbsp; <BR>
  Why?</p>
<p>Why did the University&rsquo;s rush to judgement after the police said there was nothing to charge?&nbsp; Because they wanted a new coach who was good at winning and fund raising.&nbsp; How did they do it?&nbsp; They had a feminist campus office write a false and&nbsp; misleading report.&nbsp; It is the equivalent of fake news.&nbsp; They knew few if any would stand up for the players (an exception being our column of December 29, 2916:</p>
<p><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG><STRONG>No due process is business as usual at U of M</STRONG><STRONG>.</STRONG><BR>
  <STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sad way to end an old year and begin a new one</STRONG><STRONG>.&nbsp; </STRONG></p>
<p>So why the University&rsquo;s rush to judgement after the police said nothing to charge?</p>
<p>Because the UM knew it would be easy to charge the 10, as &ldquo;all&rdquo; know that young Black men are &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; guilty, and because the one bringing the charge, a white woman, who would be seen as &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; innocent.</p>
<p>The shock was when the Hennepin County Attorney, Mike Freeman, again refused to press charges as the incident was consensual.</p>
<p>So what next?&nbsp; How will the NCAA deal with the under the table dealing with P.J. Fleck?<BR>
  How will the University President and others now justify firing Coach Clayes?</p>
<p>The UM is still racist, as the book <EM>Under the Golden Dome </EM>demonstrates, and as as I demonstrate in Chapter 10 of my book, <EM>The Minneapolis Story.</EM></p>
<p>So what is next:&nbsp; 10 hearings, one for each player must be held, according to the UM&rsquo;s own rules and regulations.&nbsp; How will it go for the UM holding hearings for innocent men caught in the UM&rsquo;s rush to judgement without due process in order to hire another coach of their choice.</p>
<p>Remaining question:&nbsp; will the University&rsquo;s desire to obtain P.J. Fleck as a Head Coach and chef fund raiser still happen?</p>
