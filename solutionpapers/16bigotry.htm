  </strong><br>
  <strong><strong>The False Comparison of Immigrant Africans to American Blacks</strong>  </strong> <br>
  <strong><strong>Another Example of Black - White Dialogue Gone Awry </strong></strong> 
  <strong> and an Attempt to Find Both of them Common Ground </strong> 
<p align="center">An Solution Paper by Ron Edwards and Beacon on the Hill Press, September 8-11, 2003, posted 
  November 8, 2003<br>
  Based on &#8220;The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes&#8221;<br>
  By Ron Edwards as told to Peter Jessen</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11-8-03 Introduction: </strong> A young member of The Minneapolis Forum issues 
  list (subscribe at http://e-democracy.org/mpls) asked if Ron Edwards had anything 
  to say about <strong>bigotry. </strong> The young are often brash with their elders but 
  in their eagerness offer the elders teaching moments, and that is what the generational 
  dialogue is all about. The four web log responses below address this inter-generational 
  dialogue on the sad but real remnants of <strong>bigotry</strong> in America. 
<p><strong>#125. Part I: </strong> Response 1 of 4 regarding the question [of what Ron Edwards 
  would say if he had a] chapter in his book on old fashioned bigotry." 
<p><strong>#126. Part II: </strong> Response 2 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron 
  Edwards has ... to say about bigotry and racism. 
<p><strong>#128. Part III: </strong> Response 3 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron 
  Edwards has ... to say about bigotry and racism. 
<p><strong>#130. Part IV: </strong> Response 4 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron 
  Edwards has ... to say about bigotry and racism. 
<p><strong>#125. </strong> Response 1 of 4 regarding the question [of what Ron Edwards would 
  say if he had a] chapter in his book on old fashioned bigotry." PART I 
<p>It has been called to my attention that ..., in a post to the Mpls.Forum Email 
  discussion group of E-Democracy, has asked if there is anything in my book against 
  bigotry because no comment was made by me regarding the example used suggesting 
  that as Somali's were fine upstanding people North side Blacks could be too. 
  [it was] said, about the "godsend" comment regarding the Somalis of [another 
  list reader], that Somalis "show Whites that Black people moving into a neighborhood 
  is not defacto synonymous with crime" because the Somalis "have a culture and 
  belief system that preclude anti-social behaviors" is "the most overtly bigoted 
  remarks I've seen on here " and then says "I guess Ron Edwards doesn't have 
  a chapter in his book on old fashioned bigotry." 
<p>Well, first of all, I spend my time in the community, not reading the Issues 
  Forum, as wonderful and useful as it is, and so I appreciate those who draw 
  my attention to various posts. But I can't respond to all of them. I appreciate 
  it when my publisher does to some. But [as some have] been so attentive to my 
  book lately I did want to pause to respond to this report of [this] concern. 
  I hope after [they] read my book [they] call me and we can sit down and talk 
  about his concerns. To that end, I had my publisher send him a book. Had he 
  read it he would not have made that statement. I&#8217;ll outline this in my next 
  three commentaries on [his] comments and show relevant places in my book that 
  address [this] concern. 
<p>Tomorrow, in <strong>Part II, </strong> I'll discuss the Somalis. The day after that, 
  in <strong>Part III: </strong>a discussion of the concept of ignorance and how it leads 
  to of bigotry, prejudice, and racism, which in turn lead to discrimination, 
  whether de jure (legally, as in Jim Crow) or defacto (done anyway, as in the 
  efforts after the 1968 Kerner Commission Report (see Blog entries #99 and #113) 
  said we weren't capable of making it on our own. Finally, in <strong>Part IV, </strong> 
  I'll discuss the Somalis again and what this discussion means and what we should 
  do about it.<br>

<p><strong>#126. Part II: Response 2 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron Edwards 
  has ... to say about bigotry and racism. </strong> 
<p>See Blog entry #125 For Part I. Now, Part II: about the Somalis. ... I have been 
  in the field working with the Somali community on a wide array of issues and 
  events for five years, including the recent killing of Somali cab drivers on 
  the streets of Minneapolis. I haven't seen [enough others] there. I invite any 
  and all who are concerned to join us in working with the Somalis. And yes, people 
  have attempted to drive a wedge between the Somalis and American Blacks. Three 
  weeks ago we all met together at the Urban League and then shared in a press 
  conference at the Urban League Family Day, and have continued to work to maintain 
  a tightness and to heal any wounds that may have opened. <strong>Just because the 
  Star Tribune, the Pioneer Press and the Democratic Party does not report these 
  events doesn't mean they aren't happening. </strong> We continue to work together 
  regardless of the attitudes or slights from the press or the DFL. 
<p>I've been meeting with the Somalis and the Elders in this town for the last 
  5 years on differences and am pleased with the progress. These are good people. 
  The animosity between our groups started over American brothers hitting on the 
  Somali brothers' women, which they take as an affront to their culture and their 
  religion. That is being addressed. And yes there are Somali gangs. But every 
  group, including Whites, have gangs, especially immigrant groups. That's the 
  history (check out the movie "Gangs of New York"). The mainstream of all groups 
  don't like the gangs of any color or ethnic group, including gangs of their 
  own people, and we and the Somalis are no different on that. As noted below, 
  I have an open invitation to talk to anyone concerned with community. We'd love 
  to have [all] on board. And as for how to solve all of these problems, I draw 
  your attention to my Solution Paper, &#8220;Seven Problems and their Solutions For 
  Stopping the Deferment of the Dream in order to Actualize The Dream,&#8221; on my 
  web site, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com, a paper some are already calling a Minneapolis 
  Agenda for Change. <br>

<p><strong>#128. Part III: Response 3 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron Edwards 
  has ... to say about bigotry and racism. </strong> For Part I see Blog entry #??? And 
  for Part II see Blog entry #???Apparently [some] felt the comparison of Somalis 
  with American Blacks [by another list member] was flagrantly bigoted. "Bigot" 
  and <strong> "bigotry" </strong>refer to someone who is "obstinately or intolerantly devoted 
  to his own opinions and prejudices." In that sense, both [the young questioner] 
  and the writer he complains about demonstrate bigotry. Never forget the wisdom 
  of the saying "opposite in content is the same process." <strong>Prejudiced, </strong> 
  as in preconceived judgment or opinion? Of course. But so are comments about 
  my book. <strong>Racist? </strong> Of course not, because Somalis and us are both Black. 
  <strong>Culturalist? </strong> Of course. <strong>Discriminatory? </strong> Ah, now we are getting 
  somewhere. Up till now, free speech was in play. I support free speech even 
  when I oppose the view. But I don't support discrimination, which is about actions, 
  based on bigoted/prejudiced/racist views. Now let's cut to the chase: <strong>ignorance? 
  Yes, </strong> of course, but so too [are comments] about my book [by those who haven't 
  read it]. So let's look at ignorance, which this certainly was: it is nearly 
  devoid of any historical and anthropological understanding. Ignorance is not 
  in itself bigoted or racist but it leads to them and alone or together they 
  lead to discrimination (slavery, apartheid, Jim Crow, etc.). First, the general 
  charge that I don't discuss bigotry (prejudice/discrimination/racism too?) shows, 
  hello, ignorance of my book. I discuss them throughout my book. Let me flip 
  open my book. On p. 179 I write about racism in city government. Pick your own 
  page. There it is. So once again I have to ask: <strong>why do people comment on 
  my book without reading it? </strong> This takes away any way to have an objective 
  discussion. The chapter on justice and fairness, Chapter 5, again outlines clearly 
  the existence of these White attributes in Minneapolis. Interludes 2 and 10 
  report the reports of them in the Star Tribune and Mpls.St.Paul Magazine. So 
  these attributes of bigotry/prejudice/ racism that lead to discrimination, call 
  them what you will are, per se, not news. Now we even sent [our young commentator] 
  a copy of my book. We do hope he gets a chance to read it and then instead of 
  me or instead of my publisher pointing out where topics of concern are located, 
  he can help do so too. I look forward to that. Wednesday, September 10, 2003,

<p><strong>#130. Part IV: Response 4 of 4 regarding the question [of what] Ron Edwards 
  has ... to say about bigotry and racism. </strong> For Parts I-III, see Blog entries 
  #125, #126, #128 Minneapolis now has Somalis in town. They came here to escape 
  the civil war in Somalia, where Blacks were killing Blacks, not because they 
  are Black but because they don't support "the other side." The Somalia civil 
  war is cultural (Islam against Christians) and political (over which tribe or 
  group should control). Since the 17th century, almost ALL immigrants to this 
  country were running from the prejudices and bigotry and discrimination and 
  racism of their home land (in the 19th century, <strong>the Irish were considered 
  "a different race," </strong> hence the shop window signs in Boston said "No Irish 
  Need Apply." As for the statement that the Somalis "have a belief system and 
  culture that preclude anti-social behaviors," well, what can I say? Somalis 
  are not robots. No group is. There is NO such thing as a culture or belief system 
  that precludes anti-social behaviors. Why respond to every outlandish claim? 
  There is work to do. All groups argue against anti-social behaviors (or at least 
  against the group or sub-group) but that has never stopped any group or sub-group 
  from doing so. Certainly no parent with teenagers can make the claim that their 
  culture or belief system precludes their teens from anti-social behavior. 
<p>And lets not dodge the bullet here: Radical Islam (whether by Somalis, Arabs, 
  Indonesians, Whites, Blacks) want an Islamic world. In every country, including 
  the U.S., where there are those who are of Radical Islam (as opposed to moderate 
  Islam), all have stated that they want their new country to become Islamic and 
  will work for that. But that is another topic for another day. My point here 
  is to encourage every one to learn of and leave their ignorance so they can 
  reduce their own bigotry, prejudices, and racism, and end discrimination, and 
  thus hold everyone, White or Black, native born or immigrant, Christian, Jew, 
  Muslim or nothing, to live according to the rules and laws of this nation and 
  follow the basics of upholding the rights outlined in the Constitution and especially 
  the Bill of Rights, for everyone. That is my goal. Provide it for everyone and 
  you provide it for your group and your self. This is clear in my book. If people 
  would read my book rather than act in a knee jerk kind of way to be the messenger 
  boys and water carriers for the DFL, where the messengers look silly and the 
  DFL behind the scenes puppeteers go unscathed. When will the messengers learn? 
  My goal remains the same: a seat at the table for everyone. Thursday, September
