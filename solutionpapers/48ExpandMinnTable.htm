    1.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Race-Pimping-Multi-Trillion-Business-Liberalism/dp/1619339528">Race Pimping: The Multi-Trillion Dollar Business of Liberalism</a>,&nbsp; </strong>by Kevin Black, a brother with a weekly St. Louis weekly radio show. <br />
    From Amazon blurb:&nbsp; Race pimping has cost America TRILLIONS of dollars, as the money is ... fantastic. Politicians line their pockets and those of family and friends, while delivering little to nothing to their constituents or the community at large.<br />
    From <a href="http://www.beacononthehillpress.com" target="_blank">p. 33 of my book</a>: $856.5 million for planing and building replacement units.  Number actually built:  52 <br />

    From Amazon blurb:&nbsp; Why is it that so many efforts by liberals to lift the black underclass not only fail, but often harm the intended beneficiaries?&nbsp; Riley examines how well-intentioned welfare programs are in fact holding black Americans back.&nbsp; &hellip;&nbsp; In theory these efforts are intended to help the poor&mdash;and poor minorities in particular. In practice they become massive barriers to moving forward.<br />
    <br />
    Data now shows the same for poor whites.<br />
    <br />
    3.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Losing-Race-Self-Sabotage-Black-America/dp/0060935936">Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America</a>, </strong>by John H. McWhorter.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Amazon blurb:&nbsp; Berkeley linguistics professor John McWhorter, born at the dawn of the post-Civil Rights era, spent years trying to make sense of this question. Now he dares to say the unsayable: racism's ugliest legacy is the disease of defeatism that has infected black America. <em>Losing the Race</em> explores the three main components of this cultural virus: the cults of victimology, separatism, and antiintellectualism that are making blacks their own worst enemies in the struggle for success.

Key former socialist and commounist countries to capitalism in its &quot;crony capitalism&quot; form are China andRussia. North Korea is leaning that way, as is Cuba.

  HAVE WE REACHED A TIPPING POINT? </strong>The Great Society has became the Great Non-Profit  Society, in which do-gooders in power too often do the opposite that they intend, as they:<br />
  <br />
  1.  
  Unintentionally corrupt the system top down for their own financial, career, survival purposes. <br />
  Keys<br />
  2. Demean or fight our profit system that provides the taxes, corporations / jobs, and deductable donations that enable the non-profit world to exist in the first place.</p>
<p>3. Will blacks, whites, hispanics, and Native Americans work together in community solidarity, from bottom up working with the middle and top, to foster developing a Society of Prosperity, Peace,   Independent Liberty and Social Equality for all?</p>
