<p><strong>2004#16. 12-24-04: MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY BLOGGING IN THE NEW YEAR!<br>
  A time for celebration and a time for resolve to perpetuate what is celebrated 
  into the new year.</strong> <br>
  [posted 12-27-04] 
<p>We wish all people of all faiths a joyous Christmas. To non-Christians, be 
  they of other faiths or no faith, know that you are remembered and included 
  because that is the Christmas message, one we can all celebrate: the message 
  of peace and brotherhood. The message of peace and brotherhood was taught by 
  Jesus of Nazareth (let his message be the beacon of light used to evaluate how 
  his followers use it, be they politically left, center, or right). Would that 
  all would cultivate love, peace and brotherhood and both demontrate it to others 
  and stand up for it to others, rather than either claiming it as their own, 
  excluding others, or disowning it because it is “Christian”. A friend of mine 
  points out that the Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt, in her book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226025985/qid=1103933200/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/104-3286913-7795119 target="_blank"><i>The 
  Human Condition,</i></a> calls for our <strong>keeping promises</strong> (as that 
  keeps chaos at bay) and <strong>forgiving others</strong> (to keep violence and revenge 
  at bay, as once people say or do something to us it can&#8217;t be reversed - OK there 
  are limits here, but you get the idea). She said these are not Christian-only 
  characteristics but the need of everyone&#8217;s human condition. It is just, she 
  said, that Jesus said it better than anyone else. Others have described this 
  book as “life changing.” Certainly it is a book all interested in changing the 
  inner city dynamics should read. 
<p>There are two type of promises that we follow and report on in our columns 
  and web page: those of governmental institutions (especially about education 
  results, its hiring and contracting compliance, housing and public safety) and 
  the social contract we have with each other when we step out of our private 
  spheres into the public spheres (maintaining a civil environment and celebrating 
  with others the displays of what is important to each other rather than excluding 
  the traditions of some because they would offend another: liberty and freedom 
  are about including all, even if that means being offended by your own intolerance 
  as you seek to reverse or nullify the traditions of those you oppose). 
<p>In our 2004#14, we congratulated Minneapolis&#8217; own <a href= http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank">Powerline 
  </a> as Time Magazine&#8217;s Blog of the year. For those wanting to learn more 
  about “blogs” (web logs) and the blogosphere made up of 5 million blogs and 
  growing (see the new book out this month by Hugh Hewitt entitled <a href= http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/078521187X/qid=1103900487/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-3286913-7795119?v=glance&s=books target="_blank">Blog: 
  Understanding the Information Reformation That&#8217;s Changing Your World</a> 
  Hugh has written a <a href=http://www.hughhewitt.com target="_blank">blog</a> 
  for two years. 
<p><a href= http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> Powerline </a> 
  and Hewitt both talk about the suppression as well as distortion regarding what 
  is going on in our world, especially as being done by the Star Tribune. We share 
  their concern as we have written numerous times. As we note on the back cover 
  of <i>The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes:</i> <el>This is the story of the 
  great experiment of the last outpost, Minneapolis, a city that has mastered 
  the harmful political and economic machinery for keeping minorities “in their 
  place” in terms of education, housing, jobs, and the war on young Black men.</el> 
<p>We welcome new additions to the realm of information gathering and distribution 
  and what Blogs, like 
<p><a href= http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> Powerline </a> 
  , and books, like <a href= http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/078521187X/qid=1103900487/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-3286913-7795119?v=glance&s=books target="_blank">Blog</a> 
  can do to get and reveal the truth, for it is only the truth that will set us 
  free. We would like to hear what they have to say about such racist organzations 
  as St. Paul&#8217;s Panzerfaust Records that seeks to entertain and create racists 
  (see our commentary about them in BTL #6) about which we have yet to hear from 
  the Governor, the mayors, mainstream editors and their columnists, nor the NAACP 
  or Urban League). We would also like to hear what the DFL has to say about the 
  poor education of minorities and the housing displacement of minorities, which 
  its policies control in North Minneapolis, and we would like to hear from the 
  two national visions of the Democratic party, the <strong> DNC</strong> (the Democratic 
  National Committee) and the <strong>DLC </strong> (Democratic Leadership Council), as 
  well as from the <strong>RNC</strong> (Republican National Committee). What is your stand 
  on keeping Blacks “in their place” as opposed to their participating in the 
  mainstream, including ownership and wealth building. Let us remember in this 
  Christmas season and throughout the year that here is not only faith and reason, 
  there is also hope. Our challenge to the world of blogs is to expose and comment 
  on the promises not kept in education, jobs, housing, and public safety as well 
  as society&#8217;s unforgiving approach to young Blacks (not to mention their own 
  towards themselves) that together are contributing to the creation of today&#8217;s 
  <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm"> State of Emergency 
  for Black Youth </a>. We offer the Golden Rule (Chapter 5) as a yardstick 
  and, as a framework for solutions, our book&#8217;s solutions gathered together in 
  the concluding chapter, and our post-book solution papers, especially <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to use to implement the <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Key Solutions</a>. May all of resolve to all use them to foster peace 
  on earth, good will toward all people and peoples. Will you? If not, why not?

<p><strong>2004/#15. 12-22-04: Mixing Red and Blue to Get Purple: Cosby and Obama. 
  </strong><br>
  [posted 12-27-04] 
<p>This week&#8217;s Newsweek magazine provides articles on the two names today making 
  the biggest splash in the news and in the Black Community: <a href=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6732651/site/newsweek/ target="_blank" > 
  Bill Cosby </a>and <a href=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6732724/site/newsweek target="_blank">Barack 
  Obama</a> 
<p>Barack Obama, newly elected Black senator from Illinois, first democratic male 
  senator in history. Cosby calls for the poor Blacks to hold u their end of the 
  civil rights bargain and pursue the American dream, generating success through 
  education, a love of hard work and self-reliance (something we sorely need in 
  Minneapolis). Obama wants to Get Beyond Blue vs. Red by mixing them to get purple 
  (something we surely need in Minneapolis). Both would seek public “assistance” 
  in its original sense: public education assisting learning so students can graduate 
  to good jobs with living wages that allow affordable housing. Cosby wants the 
  audacity of success for our young. Obama brings <strong>“the audacity of hope.”</strong> 
<p>We particularly like the fact that he has spent 20 years as a “community activist 
  exploring the viability of politics to make change.” We hope that his ability 
  to “set aside partisan differences and look for consensus” rubs off on the DFL 
  and GOP in Minneapolis. This fits in well with Bill Cosby&#8217;s <a href= http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/billcosbypoundcakespeech.htm target="_blank"
>speech</a>speech before he NAACP this year, when he asked <strong>“What the 
  hell good is Brown V. Board of Education if nobody wants it?” </strong> Cosby “railed 
  at black kids for choosing bling over books.” What was startling about the Cosby 
  speech was not what he said but that he said it instead of the NAACP. Had the 
  <strong>NAACP </strong>been doing its job, and the Urban League its job, instead of figuring 
  out how to get more money from the government to support their plushy jobs and 
  get to work in the community the way Obama has, Obama&#8217;s “audacity of hope&#8217; 
  would have visited our communities long ago. Cosby correctly emphasizes "decent" 
  values over "street" values. We are not talking rocket science. What both want 
  can be done if we ourselves in the community want it and can overcome the roadblocks 
  and sabotage by the education bureaucracy in education, that of the city&#8217;s 
  failure to enforce its own compliance rules re jobs, and the planning bureaucracies 
  regarding housing. How to solve this? We recommend serious consideration be 
  given to what we have outlined on our web site, where we talk about closing 
  the gaps in education, jobs, housing, and the <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth <font color="#000000">by</font></a>following 
  The Golden Rule (Chapter 5), using <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to implement <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The

<p><strong>2004/#14. 12-21-04: BLOG OF THE YEAR: <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a></strong> . Congratulations to Twin Cities Blog <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a> being named yesterday by Time Magazine as the “Blog of the 
  Year.” Weblogs are hard to maintain. We tried on this site for 9 months. We 
  have a “modified blog” in that we try to provide an entry on the average of 
  at least once in the week between our weekly column. We must admit that we 
  had not heard of this blog until we saw the news of the award. For those who 
  want to read more about blogs, read Time&#8217;s <a href=http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2004/poymoments.html target="_blank"> 
  article </a> on them. And, Time says, most blogs are written by <a href=http://blogsisters.blogspot.com target="_blank"> 
  women </a>. Because we are experienced in dueling with the Star Tribune, 
  we are intriqued by this quote on their web site from the Chicago columnist 
  Mark Steyn: 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p>"Everything that&#8217;s wrong with American newspapers is summed up by the fact 
    that these guys do it for free and their disparager, the pompous windbag editor 
    at the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, gets paid for it." </p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The three who write <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a>, make a distinction between Star Tribune news reporters, columnists, 
  and editorial board/writers. We believe this is awfully generous of them. Our 
  concern about the Strib refusing to review our book or even give it a news story 
  is not a concern that is "about us," but rather a concern for our city and its 
  various communities and neighborhoods: what other news needed by citizens of 
  our community are being purposefully filtered out by the Strib? It is significant 
  that in the Star Tribune&#8217;s <a href=http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5145431.html target="_blank"> 
  news story</a> about the award to <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a> is the fact that in their <a href=http://www.startribune.com/viewers/blogs/polblog.php target="_blank"> 
  list</a> of other web logs, they ignore and leave out this one. </p>
<p><a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> Powerline</a> 
  is written by three guys, John H. Hinderaker, a lawyer with the Minneapolis 
  law firm Faegre & Benson (lives in Apple Valley), Scott W. Johnson, an attorney 
  and senior vice president of TCF National Bank in Minneapolis (lives in St. 
  Paul), and Paul Mirengoff, who is an attorney in Washington, D.C. (lives in 
  Bethesda, Md). They are obviously writing from a “center right” perspective 
  (they are former liberals, one having worked in the office of then Senator Mondale). 
  We write from a community perspective regarding the progress being made or not 
  made and promises fulfilled or not kept in terms of civil rights and race relations 
  as they relate to equal access and equal opportunity in <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Key Areas</a> of education, jobs, housing, public safety, safe environment, 
  governing and ethics. We propose our solutions in our book (listed in the Conclusion 
  chapter) and on this web site&#8217;s two dozen "Solution Papers," especially 
  in our advocacy of our city using <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to address these 7 areas, especially 
  as they impact on <a href="../../solutionpapers/14unfinsheddream.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a> by and 
  the faulty policies and obviously poor outcomes of these faulty policies in 
  education, jobs and wages that have contributed to this emergency. I see overlap 
  and common ground that we share with <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a>. We will engage <a href=http://www.powerlineblog.com target="_blank"> 
  Powerline</a> in dialogue as we continue to cover the political and civic 
  affairs in Minneapolis from the perspective of <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Key Solutions</a>, in order to enable all to learn and be assisted 
  (including the public assistance of education, living wage jobs, and affordable 
  housing) so they can exercise the hard work and self-reliance that are key to 
  enabling people to strive for the American Dream and generate their own family 
  wealth.</p>

<p><strong>2004/#13 12-2-04: On December 1st, The Drudge Report carried the story 
  about &#8220;Netherlands hospital goes ahead with euthanasia for babies&#8230;&#8221;</strong> 
</p>
<p> This euthanasia is allowed by of their &#8220;Groningen Protocol,&#8221; (which 
  reminds me of &#8220;The Wannsee Protocol&#8221; movie of Kenneth Brannaugh 
  about the German&#8217;s meeting that determined &#8220;The Final solution,&#8221; 
  including who, babies to grownups, could be terminated for being defective (physically, 
  Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, coloreds, etc.). The Groningen Protocol in Holland 
  allows for euthanizing (killing) babies up to 12 years old for birth defects 
  or later discovered defects. This suggests three questions to us: (1) why aren&#8217;t 
  liberals outraged by this post-birth abortion (or is this an extension of partial-birth 
  abortion)? (2) Why isn&#8217;t it covered as news in the mainstream press, or 
  is it the desire to get this &#8220;medical procedure&#8221; approved in the 
  U.S. too? And (3) Given Blacks are held as inferior by both liberals (The 1968 
  Kerner Commission Report) and conservatives (the 1998 book &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;), 
  could, in the future, &#8220;colored&#8221; be considered a birth defect by 
  both liberals and conservatives? We&#8217;d like them to know. It is important. 
  We discuss Kerner and Bell in chapters 1, 11, 14, 16, and 17, and in Interludes 
  2, 4, and 10. They are that important. What say you, liberals and conservatives?

<p><strong>2004/#12. 12-2-04: Notre Dame: More Tarnish for the Golden Dome: Winning 
  Willingham Ousted</strong> 
<p>In Chapter 10 of The Minneapolis Story: Through My Eyes, is the story of our 
  own tarnished race relations story at the University Minnesota. In that chapter 
  we discuss another allegedly great university, Notre Dame. The connection is 
  athletics, especially football. We quoted from Don Yaeger&#8217;s book Under 
  the Tarnished Dome: How Notre Dame Betrayed Ideals for Football Glory.&#8221; 
  How does the old story go? The more things change the more they stay the same? 
  Well, South Bend has gone south again. This week, for the first time, despite 
  a winning record, Notre Dame has fired a coach before the end of his contract. 
  Coincidence that this only happened to a Black Head Coach? I don&#8217;t think 
  so. College and universities are supposed to be the heart of liberal, non-racist, 
  clear-eyed thinking. Are they? Read my chapter 10. They are not. Most coaches 
  played college ball. Yet, out of 117 Division 1A schools, only 2 Black Coaches 
  remain. Statistically, given most coaches played, you&#8217;d expect the percentage 
  of Black coaches to approximate the percentage of Black players (52%). The fact 
  is that Black Head Coaches now comprise only 1.7% of Division 1A college Head 
  Football coaches (and don&#8217;t get me started on the NFL). There are also 
  few Black professors in the elite schools. Blacks can play ball and pay tuition. 
  When will they equally Coach on the field and teach in the classroom? Only two 
  conclusions are possible. Either Blacks are purposefully discriminated against 
  or the myth that they aren&#8217;t as bright and thus aren&#8217;t considered 
  still holds, with those holding this view seeing it as rational, not discriminatory 
  because, going around in circles, Blacks aren&#8217;t smart enough to coach 
  (the same way they used to say Blacks were not smart enough to be quarterbacks). 
  But as there is no difference in intelligence, it means that the alumni who 
  control are bigots and the so-called liberal Presidents and faculty are closet 
  bigots, posing as liberals. To solve this the liberals must first confront and 
  admit to their racism. After all, its their Kerner commission Report of 1968 
  that says Blacks can&#8217;t make it on their own that continues this nonsense. 
  The Republicans just sit back and let the Democrats do their down field blocking 
  for them as both run over access and opportunity for inner city Blacks (see 
  my Chapters 5-13. In today&#8217;s Spokesman-Recorder, another writer, Lucky 
  Rosenbloom, headed his column, &#8220;Will the DFL block Black progress?&#8221; 
  The answer, given the record of the past 40 years, appears to be &#8220;yes, 
  of course, just like always.&#8221;

<p><strong>2004/#11. 12-2-04: Minneapolis announced Tuesday that it is closing 
  17 of our public schools. Only the Spokesman-Recorder notes the stark reality 
  that &quot;the Predominantly White neighborhoods keep all their schools.&quot; 
  </strong> 
<p>So the &#8220;clubbing of our cubs&#8221; (Chapter 7 of The Minneapolis Story) 
  continues. The DFL theory has been that if they can keep the Twin Cities they 
  can keep the state. No more. Closing 17 public schools, many of minorities, 
  reflects a dying city and expanding suburb. The suburbs are Republican country. 
  Here is my new thesis: As the suburbs and exurbs grow and the cities continue 
  to decline, the fallacy is exposed in the reasoning that if the major cities 
  in the U.S. are kept in Democratic Party hands, the suburbs and rural can be 
  ignored and democrats will win state and national elections. The election of 
  2004 really exposed the weakness of the city strategy. How do we &#8220;fix&#8221; 
  the cities in this country, reversing their decline, creating growth and development? 
  Let me answer again by again sounding our trumpet call: provide equal access 
  and equal opportunity for all by closing the gaps in education, jobs, housing, 
  and public safety, and end the State of Emergency for Black Youth, by following 
  The Golden Rule (Chapter 5) in using The Minneapolis Table Building Blocks to 
  implement The Seven Key Solutions. Next week we&#8217;ll deliver our promised 
  piece on economic development for the people of the cities.

<p><strong>2004/#10. 12-2-04: The Strib reports today that &#8220;Some see red 
  over kettle ban. Et tu Target and Macy&#8217;s?</strong> 
<p>When Caesar was stabbed by his best friend, he said &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot;, 
  meaning, &quot;You too, Brutus.?&quot; That is how I feel about Target and the 
  Macy group. In BTL #3 of November 23rd, we discussed Target kicking out the 
  Salvation Army Kettles. The Strib writes of it today. But we also learn that 
  Macy&#8217;s has kicked out the word Christmas, meaning &#8220;Christ,&#8221; 
  because they don&#8217;t want to offend anyone. Let&#8217;s see. The spirit 
  of Christmas is to give. The kettles collect money to give to the poor as Christ 
  commanded. And even though there are those who have gone to war over how to 
  interpret what Christ said, he never went to war nor urged anyone to do so. 
  He urged, nay commanded us to &#8220;love your neighbor,&#8221; &#8220;turn 
  the other cheek.&#8221; His is the inspiration for &#8220;peace and good will 
  toward men.&#8221; Now they want to scrub the name of the one guy who above 
  all others stands for peace. How is that offensive? Now we don&#8217;t buy presents 
  in the name of Macy&#8217;s bottom line but in the name of Christ&#8217;s bottom 
  line: to love, to serve, and to give. Christmas is a legal, national holiday 
  (since President Grant) in which all pause to give to others and, to demonstrate 
  their desire to give, spend their money in stores to do so. I find Macys finding 
  &#8220;Christ&#8221; and &#8220;Christmas&#8221; offensive, so offensive, iin 
  fact, that I won&#8217;t shop there. Macys and Target are essentially spitting 
  into the voices of Negro Spirituals that are our heritage. This is another form 
  of nascent racism. They spit on our heritage in order to not offend those whose 
  cultural backgrounds having nothing to do with us or the founding of this country. 
  What is the sense in obliterating the name of the guy who inspires us to heed 
  our better angels? Well, for turning away the kettle people helping the poor 
  I wont&#8217; shop at Target. For turning out the guys name that stands for 
  peace I won&#8217;t shop any of Macys group. As they are embarrassed to mention 
  the name of the one guy who has been consistent in urging that we take care 
  of the needy and the poor, the widows and the orphans, who wanted all to be 
  treated equally, I won&#8217;t mention their names except to encourage others 
  not to shop there. When companies are ashamed to mention the name of those who 
  would inspire the good in us I am ashamed that they are in business in my community. 
  And when they are ashamed of the name of the guy who inspires people to provide 
  them 40% of their annual sales at Christmas I can only wonder at how loving 
  and hateful they have become during this this season of loving and giving.

<p><strong>2004/#9. 12-1-04: As the NAACP President steps down, he says he &#8220;needs 
  a break.&#8221; Well, so do we. We need a break from the scandals, ineptness, 
  and the eyes wide shut in irrelevancy of our Black organizations (NAACP, SCLC, 
  Urban League). We need a break from self righteous posturing about &#8220;speaking 
  truth to power&#8221; while failing to speak truth to ourselves. To that I too 
  say, &#8220;Give me a break.&#8221;</strong> 
<p>The NAACP saga continues. We read in the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/5111383.html" target="_blank">Star 
  Tribune yesterday</a> that, just as we wrote in this space this past weekend, 
  Kweisi Mfume, self named &#8220;conquering son of kings,&#8221; has &#8220;stepped 
  down&#8221; as President of the NAACP. As the Star Tribune reported, when Mfume 
  became its President, the NAACP was tarnished by scandal and burdened by a $3.2 
  million debt. He added to the list of scandals as he reduced the debt. He says 
  he &#8220;helped revive and restore&#8221; the NAACP but now needs a break. 
  And yet he says, with a straight face, &#8220;`In my heart of hearts, I know 
  the job has been done, and I step aside willingly&#8230;to find another challenge 
  and another chance to make a real difference.&#8221; Really? The press conference 
  didn&#8217;t mention the 32 page law suit filed in Federal Court that led to 
  his stepping down. 
<p>Having been a congressman and head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mfume 
  seemed like a good choice. But where is the difference he has made other than 
  perpetuating irrelevancy and keeping his back turned against our inner cities? 
  What is in the 32 page law suit? Why does the NAACP continue to flack failing 
  inner city schools and refuse to advocate accountability from them? Where is 
  the NAACP when it comes to discrimination in jobs and housing, public safety 
  in our inner cities? Why is the NAACP ignoring the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a>? 
<p>Why is the NAACP (and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference) <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">concentrating 
  on Africa rather than our inner cities</a>, on Africa&#8217;s economic 
  development rather than that of our inner cities? From what are the NAACP and 
  the SCLC running and hiding from as they run off to Africa? Why the diversion? 
<p>Yes, Mfume has brought some organizational stability and reduced the debt, 
  but at the cost of laying off employees. How can the NAACP criticize corporations 
  when it won&#8217;t seek a &#8220;3rd way&#8221; between status quo debt increasing 
  and debt reducing through layoffs of its own people, refusing to be the example 
  it calls others to follow? He wanted to increase the 500,000 membership. He 
  didn&#8217;t. He wanted to end scandal. Instead he and his son contributed their 
  own. Why must terms like &#8220;sexual and financial improprieties&#8221; dog 
  the NAACP, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Urban League? 
<p>How is it that out of 30,000,000 Blacks in America, only 500,000 are on the 
  membership rolls of the NAACP? That is 1.6%. How can an organization with 1.6% 
  of the American Black population claim to be representative of Blacks? How can 
  our local branch, with 267 members out of 80,000 Blacks in Minneapolis, which 
  is .3%, which means one-third of 1%, be considered representative of Minneapolis 
  Blacks? This is the sham played by both White DFL politicians and their Black 
  DFL flacks. The NAACP gives cover to the DFL lie that they are concerned and 
  doing something about civil rights for the poor and minorities of the inner 
  city, and in return for the cover the NAACP doesn&#8217;t rattle the cage of 
  our city governments, all run by the DFL, for not offering programs, legislation, 
  or critiques to provide quality education, jobs, housing, public safety, and 
  something about the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a> besides jail. These &#8220;Black representative&#8221; 
  organizations seem to exist only to collect monies for Black staffers in return 
  for cover to White politicians, just as the city&#8217;s White staffers collect 
  moneys for themselves for &#8220;doing good&#8221; (recall the McKinsey Report 
  in 2002 that $1 billion was spent by Minneapolis planning agencies to yield 
  52 housing units (story appears in the June 21, 2002 issue of Skyway News). 
  So lets stop fooling ourselves that organizations like the City&#8217;s bureaus 
  or organizations like the NAACP/Urban League/SCLC are anything more, now, than 
  special interest job pools for DFL cheerleaders. This sounds harsh. So be it. 
  We need to speak truth to both power and to ourselves. We need to stop the slide 
  of the NAACP, Urban League, and Southern Christian Leadership Conference into 
  continued national and local irrelevance. All three are both badly in need of 
  reform. There is a &#8220;3rd way&#8221; for both Black organizations (national 
  and local) and government agencies (national, state, city). It is an easy way 
  to find. It sits atop this column: to close the gaps in education, jobs, housing, 
  and public safety, and address the <a href="../../solutionpapers/13emergency.htm">State 
  of Emergency for Black Youth</a>, follow The Golden Rule (Chapter 5), 
  using <a href="../../solutionpapers/23tableblocks.htm">The 
  Minneapolis Table Building Blocks</a> to implement <a href="../../solutionpapers/22actualize.htm">The 
  Seven Key Solutions</a> areas of education, jobs, housing, public safety, 
  safe environment, governing, and ethics.
