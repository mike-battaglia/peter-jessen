<p><strong>Police working quickly to capture white terrorists</strong></strong>. <strong>One caught November 24, two more November 25.</strong></p>
<p>November 25, 2015</p>
<p>We commend the police and other law enforcement officers for their diligent focus and speed to capture the four white Neo-Nazi terrorists who came to the demonstration led by Black Lives Matter and the NAACP, in the words of the Star Tribune, &ldquo;locked and loaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Mini-Paris Comes to Minneapolis, as &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; and NAACP replace &ldquo;make love not war&rdquo; with &ldquo;make war not love,&rdquo; turning the 1960&rsquo;s upside down.</strong></p>
<p>November 19, 2015</p>
<p>Outside demonstrators  have been brought in by &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; and the NAACP to understandaby demonstrate and protest regarding the shooting of a young African American by police. </p>
<p>But closing the Interstate and gathering outside the 4th Precint and throw rocks and other objects at it tarnishes the Golden Rule (all religions have a version of it), the Rule of Law (which is to suppress reigns of terror), and the goal of Civil Rights (to not take the eye off the prize of freedom for everyone).&nbsp; What is ironic is that the group they will be doing battle with are white anarchists, a new low for both groups. </p>
<p>Investors in the 1960s stayed away from riot torn areas in fear it could happen again. </p>
<p>Ever since the Great Society of the 1960s, the &ldquo;accepted wisdom&rdquo; has been that government programs with their power and funding can manage local communities by funding creative government and non-government outreach programs that will save them.&nbsp; We all know that that has not yet worked out, as conditions continue to falter because of misdirected government programs in education, jobs and housing that work against our communities.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter and the NAACP, by their actions to bring Mini-Paris to Minneapolis, betray every known formula for peace, as they carry out their acts to destroy and enslave, not free and liberate.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>What matters?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>These 5 matter:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>education/training</strong> (instead of sacrificing the lives of young people to disqualifying ignorance), <strong>jobs</strong> (requiring education and training), <strong>housing</strong> (a place for families with children after getting educated/trained and a job), <strong>health care</strong> (include all in the programs available instead of denying on account of age or color), and <strong>public safety</strong>, which includes the cleans &ndash; water, air, soil &ndash; and agents of governance: &nbsp;electeds who pass legislation to facilitate these <strong>&ldquo;5 that matter&rdquo;</strong> along with police that protect and serve.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; See my <strong><a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com/tocsolutions.htm">47 Solutions, </a></strong>&nbsp;especially &nbsp;#s 18 &ndash; 19, &nbsp;22 &ndash; 23, &nbsp;29 &ndash; 47.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Minneapolis NAACP President has invited the National NAACP President to come to Minneapolis.&nbsp; Here is the Big Question for him:&nbsp; Is he going to denounce the actions of the <strong>military wing</strong> of the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, or will he embrace their actions and contribute even more to their continued fall from grace into even more irrelevance?</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter and NAACP have taken their eyes off the prize and tarnished the hopes and future of our young people.&nbsp; To have young people cry out &ldquo;shoot a pig&rdquo; as they hurl objects at the 4th Precinct behind cover, overlooks the fact that they are also taking action against Black lives inside, showing how this kind of so-called leadership is killing our communities across the country, choking off the future of young people they have sucked into their fantasy world that there are no consequences for such acts, as if they were in a college campus bubble where cowed administrators give in at the slightest whimper and action, and hurts the credibility of the Civil Rights Movement. </p>
<p>As the President of the Minneapolis NAACP is also a professor at St. Thomas College, I have just one question for St Thomas College:&nbsp; why do you support a domestic terrorist group that are anarchists who put tearing down and destroying ahead of bringing peace and buildin up?</p>
<p>For the local NAACP and Black Lives Matter to call in fellow anarchists to infiltrate our safety and the lives of our impressionable young people, it is as if they don&rsquo;t care about all Black lives, only those who agree with them.&nbsp; Not upholding the basic rule of law and the Golden Rule, reflects how they have become intolerant and discriminatory against those they oppose who they claim are intolerant and discriminatory of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>As our mothers used to say, two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right.</p>
