<p><strong><a name="c1919d0923" id="c1919d0923"></a>September, 23, 2019 #19: Denial of service leads to Black infant's death</strong></p>
<p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>Six weeks ago, a young  mother raced her nine-month-old child to Children's Hospital in South  Minneapolis. Three weeks later, with her child showing symptoms of pneumonia,  the mother returned her baby to Children's Hospital. X-rays were taken. Staff  confirmed the child had advanced pneumonia.</p>
<p>But according to the  evidence that has been gathered, the child was turned away  and, having received none of the required medical examination protocols to  attempt to preserve its life, died shortly thereafter. Let's hope the baby's  family's eventual lawsuit fares better with the justice system than did the  Jamar Clark family.</p>
<p>What is a "protocol"? Most companies, agencies, and especially hospitals  and clinics must follow federal and state codes or protocols regarding medical  procedures ("compliance," "rules of conduct," "regulations," etc.). When not  followed, a protocol can become, to borrow a novel's title, a "Protocol of a  Damnation."</p>
<p>Our question is simple, based on evidence and discussions: Why weren't  the healing protocols followed? The baby needed medicine, but confusion at the  hospital regarding insurance resulted in the hospital not filling the  prescription. So the young mother went to Walgreens, where confusion over  eligibility to receive medication again resulted in another denial of  lifesaving medicine for her baby. Within two hours of returning home without  the medicine, the baby died.</p>
<p>The funeral was held. The baby was cremated. If not for the efforts of  Brooks Funeral Home, the child could not have had the funeral due to the cost  being beyond the reach of the mother and her family. I talked about this on my  worldwide radio program.</p>
<p>How will the legal system respond? Already attorneys are in place  seeking justice. But studying Minnesota law and reflecting on hospital legal  documents can still leave the result in question. If you are assigned to the  general wing of the hospital, the chances are that you will not be afforded  medical care &mdash; sad news for children of color in Minneapolis and America.</p>
<p>We all realize that America's healthcare system is broken and needs  fixing. And, we know that part of the fracturing of the healthcare system is  driven by forces denying equal care due to various reasons, including race and  poverty. Denial of service is harmful and thus does not meet the Hypocritic  Oath of "Do no harm."</p>
<p>The debate is over who pays and how. The eligibility question is about  when race and poverty will be taken out of the equation. </p>
<p>Over the past 16 years of this column, I have often written about how  medical care becomes selective, which is an abandonment of the goal of  providing medical care for all. So, when I received a request to again write of  this in terms of the nine-month-old baby, I saw an opportunity to again examine  the systematic medical malpractice against the interests and safety of persons  of color.</p>
<p>The tragic death of this nine-month-old reminds us of how prevalent  medical malfeasance can become. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled  that The ACA (Affordable Care Act, or "Obama Care") is constitutional. That is  now being challenged in a court that says part of ACA is "unconstitutional and  inseverable," which therefore invalidates the whole Act.</p>
<p>So now, it's not "if" but "when" health care is fixed, including  coverage of catastrophic medical expenses for all. Since 1912, seven presidents  (Republican/Progressive Teddy Roosevelt was the first) have tried to pass  healthcare legislation (three Republicans and four Democrats). </p>
<p>Nixon proposed it, but the Democrats said no. Carter proposed it, but  Ted Kennedy said "Hold it" until he was president. So far we only have  Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.</p>
<p>Will Minnesota back efforts to provide medical care for all rather than  only for selected citizens? Let us all pray for a better future.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1918d0822" id="c1918d0822"></a>August, 22, 2019 #18: In the matter of Jamar Clark.
Once again: what is just and fair?
</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>Federal  Judge Michael Davis' order for a fair-negotiation between the City of  Minneapolis and the family of the late Jamar Clark, stunned the city council  and the legal community as he requested a re-examination of all circumstances  involving Jamar Clark's November 2015, death by officer involved shooting, of  how the Clark family was delayed decisions for a year, and then offered nothing,  while Justine Damond's white family was given $20 million to the black Clark  family offer of only $200,000?</p>
<p>Council  member Cunningham asked why the compensation offer to the Clarks was only $200,000  for the death of their son when the offer to the Damonds was $20 million for  the death of their daughter. Why such obviously unjust, unfair, and unequal  decisions? To deal with this, Judge Davis summoned City officials to appear  before him, to explain on the record, about their prior actions of withdrawing  the offer to the Clark family, and then finally offering a far lower figure.</p>
<p>The  unfairness was compounded by the City's General Counsel, Susan Siegal, who  intentionally mislead the Clark family during the discussions that were drawn  out for over a year. In addition to this, was the questionable conduct by the  county attorney regarding Jerome Copeland, one of the most important  eyewitnesses to the Clark death. They made Copeland disappear on trumped up  charges trying to discredit him.</p>
<p>It was  clearly this pattern of mis-conduct by Minneapolis City officials that did not  sit well with Judge Davis, who, as an African American, clearly recognized the  pain and the insult that had been imposed on this African American family in  what was clearly a fake intention to negotiate in good faith while only  negotiating intentionally with the Damond family.</p>
<p>We  applaud a surviving sister of Mr. Clark, who stood tall, spoke with passion,  and clearly laid out the facts regarding the circumstances of dishonesty by the  City of Minneapolis regarding<strong> </strong>Clark were  done with malice aforethought. This is a fragile time for the city of Minneapolis  and its leadership regarding its credibility with the African American  community.</p>
<p>The investigation  is tainted. We call your attention to six prior columns since the 2016 Clark  killing, which identified efforts by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to  suppress and obstruct evidence that would have brought forward fruitful  observations of what happened on that tragedy that November 2016.</p>
<p>See my  MSR articles on the Clark affair dated November 24, 2015, January 27, 2016, March 2, 2016, March 23,  2015 April 6, 2016, and April 20, 2016.</p>
<p>The hero of  this story is Judge Michael Davis, who understands the quest for Justice and  the search for compassion and honesty.</p>
<p>Constitutionalists  should be concerned about the ethics and conduct of City Officials regarding  how they negotiated and obstructed justice.</p>
<p>Clearly  no true foundation was laid for balancing justice and fairness for Jamar Clark.  How staggering, in light of the $20 million for the Damund family, with only  $200,000 was designated for the Clark family. Judge Davis recognized how  fairness and justice was betrayed. How unfair to have a former BCA agent  suggest that the Clark family should be happy and satisfied with $200,000 when  the Damond family was getting $20 million to the Australian family of Justine.</p>
<p>These  numbers were based on previous payments and compensation in similar cases dealing  with the police. This has been a dangerous and slippery slope, as our refusal  to enjoin African Americans fairly and justly on race, fairness and justice for  all, as if there are those for whom the importance of their lives is not  important.</p>
<p>We owe fairness  and justice to Jamar Clark and his family. God bless them and may they find  satisfaction.</p>
<p>Stay  tuned</p>
<p>We need to again listen to Martin  Luther King, Jr.'s call to non-violence, and his urging that we judge by  content of character and not color of skin. We need to adopt Barack Obama's  vision that we are Americans first, not separate as white, black, brown or  yellow Americans.</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1917d0808" id="c1917d0808"></a>August, 08, 2019 #17: The race card played in Baltimore and America's cities.</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>We are experiencing a clash  of giants: the Civil Rights uniter, Elijah Cummings, and the divider President,  Donald Trump. We need the spirit of another giant, Thurgood Marshall, who was raised on the West Side of Baltimore, and whose <a href="https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2017/8/7/justice-for-all-50-years-after-thurgood-marshall-supreme-court-confirmation"><strong>legacy</strong></a><strong> </strong>is  clear: the "greatest civil rights lawyer and  constitutional lawyer of the twentieth century," who fought for equality for all, majority and minority,  "regardless of race or gender or circumstance, defending any individual or minority group  oppressed by the majority or by the government."</p>
<p>I am upset about the tone  of President Trump's twitter storms against Baltimore and Congressman Cummings.  Nonetheless, this clash pulls the covers back on harsh facts both parties have  long avoided, blaming each other instead. Here are facts:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Bernie Sanders, "<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-trump-sanders-baltimore-20190729-2y3vcyw4k5h5blv2x4rjs47y5m-story.html" target="_blank"><strong>four years ago</strong></a><strong>,"</strong> said being in West Baltimore was like being in a Third  World country. </li>
  <li> President Barack Obama,  in April of 2015, said that conditions in Baltimore required national <strong>"</strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/28/obama-shinzo-abe-japan-white-house-news-conference-baltimore/26505919/" target="_blank"><strong>soul searching</strong></a><strong>,"</strong> because  the<strong> "</strong><a href="https://freebeacon.com/issues/baltimore-received-1-8-billion-from-obamas-stimulus-law/" target="_blank"><strong>$1.8 billion stimulus bonanza</strong></a><strong>"</strong> he had  lavished on the city didn't seem to solve anything. </li>
  <li><em>USA  Today</em>, June 13, 2018, headlined Baltimore as being  in the top 10 "<strong><u>least livable cities in America</u></strong><u>,</u>" and on  July 30, 2019, reported Baltimore as one of  the nation's five "<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/19/homicides-toll-big-u-s-cities-2017/302763002/" target="_blank"><strong>most dangerous</strong></a><strong>"</strong> cities."</li>
  <li><em>USA Today</em>, July 30,  2019, Baltimore ranks "<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/news/2019/07/24/most-dangerous-cities-world-tijuana-caracas-cape-town/1813211001/">27th of the "The 50 most dangerous cities</a><strong>"</strong><strong> </strong>in the  world." Also on the list of 50: New Orleans (50), Detroit (46), San Juan (40), St.  Louis (15). 5 in the USA. Mexico (15), Brazil (14), Venezuela (5), Honduras  (3), Columbia (2), South Africa (2), and one each in El Salvador and Guatemala.</li>
  <li>HBO's "<a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-wire" target="_blank"><strong>The Wire</strong></a><strong>,</strong>" was about  West Baltimore. In February 2018, USA TODAY reported that "Baltimore is the  nation's "<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/19/homicides-toll-big-u-s-cities-2017/302763002/" target="_blank"><strong>most dangerous</strong></a><strong>"</strong> big city."</li>

Only 2 are in Africa (both in South Africa).</li>

<p>Baltimore has been dubbed the &quot;most  dangerous city&quot; in Maryland. That's according to the financial news and  opinion site 24/7 Wall St., which dug into FBI data from 2017 to determine  violent crime rates in nearly 2,000 cities and towns.</p>
<p><em>USA TODAY:</em> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/30/trump-baltimore-sun-rats-elijah-cummings-mayor-bernie-sanders-column/1856666001/"><strong>The president is right about Baltimore.  Are Democrats really prepared to defend failure?</strong></a></p>

<p>Think of what could be done  by the powerful Chairman of the Oversight Committee and the President of the  United States, working together to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>We need to again listen to  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call to non-violence, and his urging that we judge by  content of character and not color of skin. We need to adopt Barack Obama's  vision that we are</p>
<p>President Trump continues  from earlier attacks, as when he said that Barack Obama was born in a grass hut  in Kenya, Africa, an accusation and insult of a birther.</p>
<p>These are troubling times,  dangerous times, as too many refuse to listen to such great voices as JFK (moon  vision), LBJ (Great Society vision), MLK, Jr (non-violence vision), Nellie  Stone Johnson (activist vision), Thurgood Marshall (equal vision), and others,  visions of Americans of all colors and persuasions rallying around and standing  together, equally proud of each other and our nation.</p>
<p>The political decisions  fracturing respect and civility, has us teetering as if on the head of the  Statue of Liberty, casting shadows on the Washington Monument and the Lincoln  Memorial. We need instead to remind ourselves of the words and spirit of such  patriotic songs as "America the Beautiful."</p>
<p>The race card will not  serve any who use it in 2019 and 2020. We need to stand up for our country, our  cities, and each other.</p>
<p>God bless America.</p>

<p>"&hellip;..segregated West  Baltimore&mdash;a Harlem-like mecca of political activism, achievement, and black  culture (Marshall went to school with Cab Calloway)&mdash;that Marshall's worldview  took shape. For decades, national civil-rights leaders, including Marshall's  friend Clarence Mitchell Jr., the NAACP's chief lobbyist in Washington during  the 1960s, would rise from West Baltimore, which had been home to the  forerunner of the NAACP, the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty, and then  home to one of the strongest branches of the NAACP."</p>
<p>"Traveling nearly 50,000 miles each year, mostly by  train, often alone, his life threatened too many times to count, Marshall took  Jim Crow apart plank by plank, state by state, federal ruling by federal  ruling. Overseeing hundreds of cases as director of the NAACP Legal Defense  Fund for 21 years, Marshall set precedent after precedent, not just in the  arenas of education and criminal law, but across every sector of public  life&mdash;voting, housing, transportation, equal pay, taxpayer-funded services,  military justice, higher education, and the rights of minorities to serve on  juries."</p>
<p>"Three examples: Marshall helped establish that  coerced confessions are not admissible in court; that states cannot legally  enforce restrictions on the sale of homes to minorities; and that nonwhites  cannot be barred from voting in primary elections, which, in many parts of the  country, were the only votes that mattered."</p>
<p>Marshall, called  the "dismantler of Jim Crow," enabled the striking of the death knell for  the USA legal apartheid system of "separate but equal." He pursued laws that  responded to "all are created equal," by which he meant "getting  the same thing, at the same time, and in the same place," for "any individual or minority group oppressed by the  majority or by the government, and that included women, the physically  challenged, and criminal defendants."</p>
<p>&hellip;"Marshall&mdash;as courageous, tenacious, and visionary  an individual as this country has ever produced&mdash;changed America." </p>
<p>"In the courtroom,  he made his case with facts, the law, and the Constitution in a frank manner,  neither alienating juries, Southern judges, nor opposing counsels, with whom he  generally got along. </p>
<p>"Because  separate but equal facilities had never truly been accomplished&mdash;public services  for blacks were uniformly inferior&mdash;the only solution, Marshall began to argue,  was to make all public facilities and services open to all races."</p>
<p>"When asked during  the Brown arguments by Justice Felix Frankfurter what he meant by "equal," Marshall  responded in the same forthright, plainspoken manner that had become his  hallmark.</p>
<p>It is a  footnote in history that Johnson was so intent on appointing the first black  justice he created an opening on the court by naming Ramsay Clark attorney  general in early 1967. That move essentially forced his father, Supreme Court  justice Tom Clark, to resign because of a conflict of interest."</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1916d0725" id="c1916d0725"></a>July, 25, 2019 #16: A City in Danger. America's new version of Tombstone
</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>As the level of gun violence in the twin cities of Minneapolis and  St. Paul, continues to escalate, we see no real attempts to follow any of many  solutions proposed. The MSR last week had an article on fathers needing to talk  to their sons. Jamil Jivana has recently written <em>Why Young Men, </em>about solutions to combat the rise in  violence committed by young men around the world (all colors), </p>
<p>On Friday, July 12, 2019, gunmen walked into the upscale, CRAVE roof  top restaurant dat Hennepinn Avenue and 8th Street, in the heart of  down town Minneapolis. Its was the latest violence in our city. Minneapolis Mayor  Jacob Frey and Minneapolis Chief of Police Medaria Arradondo say they have a plan. As of the writing of  this column we are still waiting for the unveiling of their plan.</p>
<p>Gunfire has become a a new normal most nights and days, as we  reported in recent columns (<em>A city under  siege</em>, 6-20-19; <em>A Paralyzed Nation Prepares  for 2020, </em>6-27-19; <em>How long will rage  be the order of the day?</em><strong> </strong>July  11, 2019,). Our sister city of St. Paul, the state capital of Minnesota, is not  far behind us in violence and mayhem.</p>
<p>The violence early Saturday morning, July 13, in down town  Minneapolis, reflects a dangerous pattern of planning and implementing  violence. The rioting and confrontation between party goers and law enforcement  frightened both citizens and visitors to downtown Minneapolis. The same weekend , 20,000 young people from 13 countries of the  Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, were holding a youth faith gathering at Vikings  stadium.</p>
<p>I have warned about this. Predictions of both what is hoped for  and what is hoped to be avoided reflect a decade of what some call the "new  normal," which means leadership (community, government, corporate, profits and  non-profits, TV, radio and print) step away from this violence as "normal"  reflects the decision to not recognize the homicidal mentality as "this too  shall pass," that this violence will  subside, until, of course, the next time this now "normal" cycle circles back.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear the comments of some who were  interviewed by TV, cable, radio and print reporters and journalists, many  offering a shell-shocked reflection of concern and fear of the "new normal"  they have just lived through. The event caused panic up high, on the upscale  roof top restaurant, as well as down on city streets, as leadership once again  looked the other way, as if the carnage and chaos that erupted in the Twin  Cities and surrounding metropolitan areas will self-contain and self-remove.</p>
<p>Belief in the "new normal" prevents confronting the truth of a  city's violence that too often reminds us of TV and movie westerns of the wild  west's changing "normals," as seen in such famous wild west place names as  Northfield, Tombstone, Abilene, and Dodge City, including the famous outlaw  criminals in early 20th century St. Paul.</p>
<p>Then the shootings are gone. Until, of course, the next time. For  some, being startled beyond anything imaginable showed up as a temporary  interruption of what was to have been a beautiful rooftop experience of a great  evening and what had bee n assumed to be a safe activity to enjoy.</p>
<p>It is a sad commentary when Minneapolis sounds like a movie based  on a violent novel of a distant past. Where are the touted solutions, or is  their missing also part of the "new normal?"</p>
<p>A long wondered question: why has no organization, agency, person  or leader asked about the solutions suggested in my 2002 book, my 16 years of  columns since 2003, and the over 50 solutions on my Minneapolis Story web site?</p>

<p><strong><a name="c1915d0711" id="c1915d0711"></a>July, 11, 2019 #15: America is angry on the 4th of July.
How long will rage be the order of the day?
</strong></p><p><em>Through My Eyes, the  Minneapolis Story Continues...&quot;</em><br>
  <em>A weekly  column by Ron Edwards, as featured in the <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/News/default.asp" target="_blank">Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</a></em></p>
<p>We don't need future historians to  look back to see what we already know, that on this 2019 fourth of July,  America is a split nation, and therefore a dangerous nation, as the debate  continues whether to heed Lincoln's prophetic words of "united we stand,  divided we fall." Will we go forward with "malice toward none" or pay, again in  Lincoln's words, the "full measure" of "lives and treasure" if we continue with  malice?</p>
<p>How will future historians interpret  our split of each half hating the other half? Will they record we took the  dangerous, grim path of the French Revolution's "by any means necessary," or  that we took the path of hope born of being thankful for America and work  instead to heal the split and not make it wider?</p>
<p>Will future historians speak of us, as  was spoken about the early 20th century civil war in Spain, the  chilling words that the modern Spain that emerged "has nothing to do with what  either side fought and died for." At least the USA ended slavery and  segregation and set us on the path of our yet unfinished project of fully  legalizing civil rights, unfinished due to violence against each other and  remaining legal barriers. How will they say we handled such shootings as those  in Minneapolis and St. Paul the Thursday and Friday before the 4th  of July celebrations?</p>
<p>As of the crafting of this column, the  top of community and government leadership, profit and non-profit leadership,  have too often been silent. In some areas of the Twin Cities, such as the East  side of St Paul and the North side of Minneapolis, people talk about sleeping  in their bathtubs because of the death and injury potential of spraying bullets  bringing death and injury.</p>
<p>We ask again, what is the anger that  seems to be driving violence in America on this 4th of July? The  Star Tribune, the Sunday before the 4th of July, highlighted  statements of Minnesota's Attorney General, Keith Ellison, who talked about the  hatred that is poisoning rural Minnesota, as if such hatred is new? It isn't  new. The AG knows that for the 12 years he represented the 5th  Congressional District, the 5th was long a hotbed of casualties and violence.</p>
<p>The article in the Star Tribune is an  exception to the usual silence, whereas news stories and columnists of the  Minnesota Spokesman Recorder, have regularly reported on the violence, hate,  and biases reflecting on America's unfinished project of evolving into united  we stand instead of malice toward others.</p>
<p>The greatest proof of this sense of  anger, frustration, and betrayal is the election of Donald Trump, as seen by  the antagonism toward him by both Democrats and Republicans, and his support by  leading religious groups, whether Roman Catholic, Protestant, or evangelical.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans fostered  policies that led to 60,000 factories closing, sending millions of America's  jobs to China, Mexico, and beyond. Now 100s of thousands of immigrants arrive  to take existing jobs, playing ping pong with census and putting energy into  destroying rather than building. Will our middle class continue to disappear as  our southern border opens ever wider to new arrivals coming as a flood across  the Rio Grande?</p>
<p>Langston Hughes, a leading light of  the Harlem Renaissance movement summed up our problem with the title of his  1930 novel, "Not Without Laughter." As Maya Angelou opened her introduction to  Hughes novel, "It is dangerous to believe a declaration of seriousness if the  declarant has no sense of humor." We need to match the "little rocket man" DMZ  sense of humor.</p>
