      <p><strong>BLACK AMERICAN ACTIVIST TELLS IT LIKE IT IS</strong></p>
      <p align="right"><strong>INNER CITIES IN AMERICA ARE LIBERAL PLANTATIONS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS IS THE GREAT EXPERIMENT AND THE LAST OUTPOST</strong></p>
      <p>Ron Edwards, well known civil rights and community activist, connects 
        the dots to bring an understanding of the purposeful segregation and discrimination 
        that he has witnessed, personally experienced, and fought against in Minneapolis 
        over the past 40 years. In his newly released book, The Minneapolis Story, 
        Through My Eyes, he provides 18 riveting chapters and 16 enlightening 
        short Interludes of significant historical happenings, as he discusses 
        throughout, how Minneapolis, one of the whitest cities in America has 
        operated. Ron writes about what the great Pulitzer prize winning author 
        James Baldwin called America&#146;s systematic efforts &quot;to keep Black 
        people in their place.&quot; </p>
      <p>Ron Edwards thoroughly engages his reader in what will become known as 
        a must read not just in the Black community, but for all people who want 
        to see just how a city operates and what is behind a city&#146;s willingness 
        to pay the price of unrest and disturbances in order to deny Blacks adequate 
        education (keeping Blacks in poor schools and thus not competitive with 
        suburban kids), housing (the Holmann project as an example of razing Black 
        housing in order to create White housing), and job opportunities (purposefully 
        denying Black contractors and Black workers), as Whites systematically 
        try everything, from gerrymandering to court records tampering to stealing 
        (shredding?) files to buying off Black leadership to the theft of Black 
        wealth and property, to carrying out a war against young Black men to 
        holding the University higher than people, to manipulating the electoral 
        process to a whole range of corrupt practices, including setting up the 
        mostly Black team, the NFL Vikings, to be run out of town. The Minneapolis 
        Story is not just a tell all, it is an explain all, as Ron connects the 
        dots to explain the systematic efforts to deny Blacks equal access and 
        equal opportunity. But this is not just a Black story, for, as Ron Edwards 
        says, if they can do this to Blacks they can certainly also do it to Whites 
        who are not wealthy, powerful, or connected.</p>
      <p>Ron Edward&#146;s biggest concern is for the war America is waging on 
        young Black men and the systematic denial of this by so-called Black organizations 
        that have become so irrelevant that no Black under 25 would give a dime 
        for either the NAACP or the Urban League, who have become part of the 
        problem, not the solution, as they collude with the city powers to keep 
        poor Blacks down on the Mississippi&#146;s Grandest Liberal Plantation. 
        Ron Edwards book is destined to be a best seller as he brings to America 
        an authentic voice of the everyday Black person In The Minneapolis Story, 
        Ron Edwards connects the dots for the reader, acting as a beacon on the 
        hill shining the light of truth. </p>
      <p>Ron Edwards brings a welcome relief to stand against the kind of self-serving 
        and self-enriching proclamations of such self-appointed Black leaders. 
        Sometimes like a voice in the wilderness, Ron Edwards never takes his 
        eyes off the prize of equality&#146;s freedom. </p>
      <p>And yet, as clear as it is that he doesn&#146;t like the racist system 
        of Minneapolis, it is also clear that he loves his city, its people, and 
        that he brings a joy of living to the work he has done as a community 
        advocate. </p>
      <p>Ron Edwards reflects those historic and legendary Black men who despite 
        the station forced on them in life by their White overlords, could still 
        find grace and dignity, respect and honor, in meaningful life of purpose 
        supporting the civil rights and human rights causes. He doesn&#146;t mix 
        up the competing warriors fighting over the government and foundation 
        monies. Blacks are the focus. Ron respects all legitimate minorities, 
        and some of them have legitimate issues, but none come close to the issue 
        of the centuries long discrimination against the Black man. Nonetheless, 
        Ron Edwards finds way to address the situation in Minneapolis throughout 
        the book, and provides concrete ways for evaluating how to develop &quot;a 
        better future&quot; of &quot;positive possibilities.&quot; He not only 
        provides ways for people to talk the walk, he brings all of his suggestions 
        together at the end of the book for all of those who want solid, positive 
        suggestions for walking the talk. The Minneapolis Story will open your 
        eyes and hearts. We hope it also opens you up to follow the positive action 
        Ron outlines for all the peoples of Minneapolis to work and play and be 
        in community together</p></td>

      </p>
      <p>What would happen if a community activist with more than forty years 
        of experience in the City of Minneapolis was willing to distill everything 
        he had learned about the city into a handful examples of what has been 
        wonderful to some and dreadful to others, and showed both how they could 
        get on the same side of wonderful? It would change the city.</p>
      <p>Ron Edwards has done exactly that in The Minneapolis Story. He has combined 
        insights learned from his forty-plus years of watching and participating 
        in the city&#146;s successes and mistakes with observations from the front 
        lines of community interaction with the people of the city and the powers 
        of the city (courts, mayors, city council, corporations). The result is 
        a revealing look at Minneapolis as only a great storyteller can tell it, 
        in the tradition of African villages passed on to slaves on plantations. 
      </p>
      <p>It is not often a publisher has an opportunity to bring to the public 
        a book that is destined to be a classic, a book that has the potential 
        to make a positive impact on the domestic issues of this country today, 
        a book that has all of the ingredients of a recipe for healing and reconciliation 
        between the races by providing first a catharsis by stating the awful 
        and sometimes terrifying truths and then closing with positive suggestions 
        for positive possibilities for everyone.</p>
      <p>Topics like discrimination and racism in the courts, education, housing, 
        jobs, city contracting, the primacy of the University, the gerrymandering 
        recently undertaken to impoverish and disempower the Blacks of North Minneapolis, 
        the co-opting of Black organizations like the NAACP and the Urban League 
        such that they are now in collusion with the White bosses to make sure 
        the &quot;field hands&quot; stay in their fields are the sexier aspects 
        of being at the center of a City for forty years. Not so sexy are the 
        sad, tragic, and fearsome reminders of the other side of the race coin: 
        the systematic lynching, denial of liberties, and constant repression 
        in all things possible, including the total destruction of Black towns, 
        to the ground, including one instance where 200</p>
      <p>Black women and children were fed to the pigs. Ron Edwards knows these 
        things from the past because he was told them by his father and grandfather. 
        History has long written these stories but they have also been long forgotten, 
        but Ron brings them back to life for you. Ron Edwards demonstrates that 
        the ultimate difference between a community&#146;s people and its leaders 
        is, in fact, the ability to provide or prevent equal access and equal 
        opportunity in the areas of education, housing, and jobs. </p>
      <p>Equal opportunity and equal access are the missing links in the Black 
        community as the City purposefully seeks to maintain a consistency in 
        that denial. Edwards points out that the biggest obstacle to success is 
        the absence of a sense of a common ground in the areas of education, children, 
        and families, as well as in transportation, energy, and the environment, 
        as well as the economy, jobs, wages, and minority business. </p>
      <p>Through a series of chapters on the major concerns of the city over the 
        past 40 years, such as education, housing and jobs, Edwards outlines how 
        the city has been willing to pay the price of civil unrest and disturbances 
        to keep Blacks in their place. He eloquently writes how he wants these 
        things &quot;not here, not there, not anywhere.&quot; </p>
      <p>To give us guideposts to help us in our journey to establish common ground, 
        he tells the stories of key figures, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson 
        and Abraham Lincoln, as well as about George Washington Carver, W.E.B. 
        DuBois, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Justice Thurgood Marshall. He tells 
        us what we don&#146;t want, what will become his famous NOs, as he explores 
        in short interludes the stories of Dred Scott, the 10,000 men named George, 
        of the systematic taking of the land of Blacks from them by individuals, 
        companies, and governments, as well as the lynching and assassinations.</p>
      <p>He objectively records the racism of the 1990 reports on racism by the 
        Star Tribune and the Mpls.St.Paul magazine, and how little has changed 
        since then. He notes the progress, which is great, the glass half full, 
        but reminds us also that a half full glass is also half empty and brings 
        us back to the poor person, especially the poor Black, asked to live in 
        substandard housing and work for wages that even when earned working full 
        time won&#146;t support a family, which is terrible. </p>
      <p>At the end he gathers all of his recommendations together and offers 
        good advice on working to get along to find that common ground all can 
        celebrate and if all adopt, can finally bring all citizens together moving 
        forward in the 21st century in a positive and meaningful manner. Remember, 
        Ron is telling you the Minneapolis story because you need to know. He 
        is passing it on to you. Now you buy the book, cherish the book, and pass 
        its knowledge on to others.</p>
      <p><strong>Book Description</strong></p>
      <p>The book shows how to establish that cooperative common ground of community 
        and neighbor, of professional and non-professional, of the political class 
        and the business class, of the need for the better of all to work to ensuring 
        equal access and equal opportunity for all.</p>
      <p>He never caves in to the seeming madness of &quot;the man,&quot; and, 
        as he continues his work, becomes a man with unparalleled insight into 
        why what has taken place has, and why what is going to take place will, 
        including the soon to be loss of the Vikings from Minnesota. In this book 
        Ron Edwards gives us the benefit of his knowledge and experience as he 
        works to close the gap between results that are possible, and results 
        that can serve as an example to others.</p>
      <p>In the process of connecting the dots regarding Minneapolis operates, 
        he has also described and exercise steps to achieve his &quot;vision&quot; 
        while working with others. Ron Edwards show the importance of being deeply 
        and passionately engaged in community, and now seeks to foster that engagement 
        through the chapters he has collected with his robust dialogues about 
        people, events, and the strategies and operations needed to succeed, strategies 
        resting on intellectual honesty and realism. As a community activist, 
        Ron is always fighting. </p>
      <p>If people will read his book and gather in discussion groups, and act 
        positively on what they have read, they will develop an ensuing leadership 
        gene pool that could conceive and select strategies that can be executed 
        to achieve the common YESes and deny the common NOs. People could then 
        work together to create a strategy, to work to prepare the kids for a 
        stiff-arming on the world track. </p>
