  #36: The Twin Towers of Minneapolis' Nullification and Reversal Begin to Finally 
  Crumble as 5 Black Officers Sue the City for discrimination. </strong></p>
<p>The recent headlines tell the story: in the Strib: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12081986.html" target="_blank">High-ranking 
  black cops sue Minneapolis Police Department</a>; in the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder: 
  <a href="http://www.spokesman-recorder.com/news/article/article.asp?NewsID=84454&sID=4&ItemSource=L" target="_blank">Black 
  officers sue MPD, Chief Dolan</a> </p>
<p>The press conference on Monday, December 3, 2007, announcing the law suit set 
  up the rest of the press conferences. And, as if to give a preview to and credence 
  for the law suit, the Strib reported the week previous to the press conference, 
  coincidentally, as backdrop serendipity, the discriminatory act of <a href="http://www.startribune.com/10241/story/1579845.html" target="_blank">Minneapolis 
  detective in bicyclist case reassigned</a>, to which <a href="http://www.startribune.com/10241/story/1582254.html" target="_blank">Outcry 
  over Minneapolis detective's transfer grows</a>. </p>
<p>This is historic on many levels as it relates to the ongoing discussion of 
  what to do with an <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:qm9wtVXSE_IJ:www.ffl.msu.ru/img/pages/File/new-immigrants.doc+minneapolis+black+population+statistics&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=19&gl=us" target="_blank">"immigrant 
  magnet city" such as Minneapolis which is one of the emerging "multiple melting 
  pots."</a> </p>
<p>How this law suit is handled will have ramifications in governance and race 
  relations far beyond the borders of Minneapolis. The ignoring of the problems 
  by the Mayor/City Hall and the Chief/MPD, are chickens that are now coming home 
  to roost. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12272176.html" target="_blank">The 
  city's response</a> is to harden its discrimination denial so as to portray 
  the police chief as a victim ("Lonely at the top"), <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12493601.html" target="_blank">and 
  to have the Director of the City's Civil Rights Department to take the gloves 
  off against your "notorious" columnist and fairness and justice advocate </a>( 
  see <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/12493601.html" target="_blank">5 
  black police officers play blame game with Jordan</a>). </p>
<p>And remember, the suit is not about the discrimination of not hiring enough 
  Blacks (although, as we will see, trying to avoid it by the city contributes 
  to the internal problems).   This law suit is about four forms of internal, 
  on the job discrimination:   <strong>(1) </strong> career advancement/promotions, 
  <strong>(2) </strong> job benefits like training/assignments/overtime, <strong>(3) 
  </strong> creating a hostile environment that promotes esprit de corp for whites 
  at the exclusion of the Blacks when any paramilitary force only works well when 
  all members are integrated into the team, regardless of color or gender or creed, 
  and <strong>(4) </strong> being again put "in their place" by having the truth 
  of their grievances dismissed by the city's black Civil Rights Department Director 
  as merely being that of   &quot;disgruntled cops near the end of their 
  careers.&quot; </p>
<p>As no one has yet figured out how to get around the appearance of discrimination, 
  a rule of statistics is used that suggests that any department would have, as 
  a percentage of its members, the same percentage of the group as in the population. 
    </p>
<p>The department maintains that 18% are minorities.   Most people will read 
  that and say, hey, there are only 12% Blacks in this country and here they have 
  18% Black cops, so what's the beef? </p>
<p>It doesn't work that way.   First of all, cities have more blacks than 
  suburbs. Thus, Minneapolis city has nearly 20% Blacks (whereas Detroit, by contrast, 
  is 81% Black and Atlanta 70%).   This means that there should be nearly 
  20% in the police department.   The 18% "people of color" would seem to 
  be "close enough."   </p>
<p>But that figure is a lie.   </p>
<p>And its perception of being about Blacks is a lie.   </p>
<p>It has taken us a long time to get the information from the department, but 
  the PCRC finally obtained a list of officers by race (and note these are self-designated, 
  so we don't know how many non-Blacks are using the category in order to get 
  a job).   </p>
<p>In the city of Minneapolis, 18% of the <a href="http://wcco.com/topstories/Census.Bureau.Minnesota.2.367457.html" target="_blank">population</a> 
  is African American and 10% of the population is Hispanic. I couldn't find numbers 
  on the Asian population here right now. Read more about <a href="http://www.education.umn.edu/MN/diversity.html">Demographics 
  of Diversity in Minnesota </a>and read the WCCO piece on <a href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/minneapolis-st-paul/87939-african-americans-north-minneapolis.html" target="_blank">African 
  Americans in North Minneapolis</a>, and this piece on <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itsv/0699/ijse/frey.htm" target="_blank">immigration</a>.</p>
<p>And where does the MPD get the 18% figure? It is from Census Bureau statistics 
  as reported by both the <a href="http://education-portal.com/articles/Minnesota_(MN):_Universities_and_Colleges.html" target="_blank">University 
  of Minnesota</a>, which has reported that Minneapolis race and ethnic breakdown 
  is: </p>
<p>African-American: 18%<br>
  Asian: 6.10%<br>
  American Indian and Alaskan: 2.20%<br>
  White: 65.10%<br>
  Hispanic (not listed, although other sources cited say 10%). </p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Minneapolis-Minnesota.html" target="_blank">city 
  statistics</a> re races in Minneapolis: </p>
<p>White Non-Hispanic (62.5%)<br>
  Black (18.0%)<br>
  Hispanic (7.6%)<br>
  Two or more races (4.4%)<br>
  Other race (4.1%)<br>
  Other Asian (3.6%)<br>
  American Indian (3.3%)<br>
  Chinese (0.6%)<br>
  Vietnamese (0.6%)<br>
  <em>(Total can be greater than 100% because Hispanics could be counted in other 
  races) </em></p>
<p>As you can see, the 18% figure refers to "minorities," <strong>not </strong> 
  people of color.   And people of color often refers now not to Blacks but 
  to Asians, Hispanics, American Indians, etc. </p>
<p>And so Minneapolis continues to try to reduce the number of Blacks in the police 
  force.   Of the people of color, or minorities, on the police force, less 
  than half are Black.   The number of Blacks is closer to 7.5%.   The 
  rest, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, are listed due to self-classification. 
    We applaud the inclusion of Hispanic, Native Americans, and Asians, and 
  respect these brothers and sisters of color.   But that is not the point. 
</p>
<p>So lets look at how these liars are lying with figures, hiding behind the skirt 
  of another lie:   that figures don't lie.   </p>
<p><a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8906(198631)47%3A1%3C79%3APWHAHO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4" target="_blank">The 
  underlying dynamic has not changed since 1880</a> when there were only 262 Blacks 
  in Minneapolis:   paternalism, even by enlightened leaders, even Wheatley 
  House settlement house reformers.   Paternalism is the liberal nice-word 
  for plantation bosses.     1930:   4,176 Blacks.   
  In 1923, Minneapolis had 10 Ku Klux Klan chapters, as this small number instilled 
  in the town fear, paternalism and prejudice.   Minneapolis was also identified 
  as one of the most <strong>anti </strong>- <strong>Semitic </strong> cities 
  in the country. </p>
<p>The Star Tribune would have you believe this all started 9-11-07, that it is 
  isolated, and due to the bungling of Michael Jordan.   He served at City's 
  table but is expendable so they are making his "mistakes" the reason.   
</p>
<p>They lie.   </p>
<p>All Jordan was doing was what he was told to do by the Mayor.   </p>
<p>That he didn't stand up for the mission of his department is troubling.   
  But he is but one more in a long line of servants of a city that fights integration 
  and fights the equal access and equal opportunity that integration implies. 
     </p>
<p>This law suit's beginning wasn't 9-11-07 but from 1920 when restrictive immigrations 
  quotas opened up jobs for Blacks previously given to mostly European immigrants 
  now restricted.    Minneapolis response to this northern migration 
  of Negroes was segregating, not integrating, and the opportunities of welcome 
  and integration began their patterns of postponement and sabotage.   </p>
<p>9/11 with Jordan was merely the straw that broke the camel's back.   9/11 
  was the trigger. </p>
<p>The law suit is not only about their lies but about their covering it up.   
  The other articles referenced above are about their lie about a murdered bicyclist, 
  stating he was on a drug buy so as to cover the truth that yes, you can be randomly 
  killed on the streets of Minneapolis.   The Mayor and Chief would have 
  us believe it only happens to gang bangers.   Therefore, if it happens 
  to you, you   must be a gangbanger. </p>
<p>An inversion is being corrected in Minneapolis.     Martin Luther 
  King, Jr. asked that we be judged by the content of our character, and not by 
  the color of our skin.   The city has long inverted that, standing it on 
  its head:   judge us by the color of our skin (white is wonderful) as we 
  lack character in civil rights.   This law suit turns what had been turned 
  on its head back on its feet.   </p>
<p>The city's response before and since:   lying.   </p>
<p>Not a sign of good character.   Just like the Police Chief of Nottingham 
  in Robin Hood.    The people don't count.   Especially the residents 
  of Minneapolis' inner city Sherwood Forest. </p>
<p>Our Nottingham nemises has a flawed theory.   The Mayor, Chief and City 
  look the part but are fake; they can't be trusted.   Hence the PCRC; hence 
  the call for receivership that would put the police department under federal 
  control until the city gets it right with the MPD.   The chief and mayor 
  live in a dream world.   Whatever they have "dropped" with Tim O'Leary, 
  they have tuned out the facts and have created a dream world.   </p>
<p>Let's remember that at first, civil rights dealt with making up for the results 
  of 400 years of servitude and not being allowed to be educated and prosper. 
    Sadly, that is the situation still in the inner cities.   </p>
<p>Civil rights has been replaced by special interest group rights, with so many 
  now classified as "minorities" that the head of Minneapolis' Civil Rights Department, 
  a Black man, brags that Minneapolis can meet its hiring requirements in terms 
  of minorities without hiring any Blacks.   </p>
<p>In 1991, the Strib ran a tremendous series indicating how racist Minnesota 
  is (that is, not just disliking or fearing Blacks, but actually discriminating 
  in the sense of preventing Blacks from doing things solely on account of the 
  color of their skin, things like get schooling, jobs,   housing, etc). 
</p>
<p>And what was done?   Not much.   The key term?   Minorities.</p>
<p> What did "minorities" originally mean?   Blacks.   African-Americans. 
    Negroes.   That became too much.   It is one thing to accept 
  equality in the mind, it is another to live it.   So what has Minneapolis 
  done?   Gone, along with the national trend to define minorities as any 
  group not white male, so that, as we have reported in our columns, the civil 
  rights department has bragged that they can meet minority hiring requirements 
  without hiring Blacks.   And so they don't, denying equal access and equal 
  opportunity. </p>
<p>And so "diversity" is the new code word for segregation.   Diversity now 
  means there are Blacks.   And in school after school in this country, more 
  and more are becoming less and less integrated.   But they represent diversity, 
  as they have Blacks (even if it now means mostly Blacks). </p>
<p>The city is surprised by this suit not because of what it contains, but that 
  five officers were strong enough, bold enough, and of character enough, to confront 
  them after long trying to deal with this without a law suit, as the stories 
  linked above report.   The city has long had the attitude, "Bring it on." 
    Now they are surprised that these five men are man enough to bring it. 
</p>
<p>You need not only eyes to see but the desire to see.   You not only need 
  ears to hear but the desire to hear.   The city has played blind man's 
  bluff.   These officers have decided its time to play pin the tail on the 
  donkey. </p>
<p>It should not be a surprise that 5 Black police officers sued the city and 
  that, as a result, the PCRC (Police Community Relations Council) has called 
  for the department to be placed in receivership and run by the feds.    
  That this is an unexpected surprise felt by the City (Mayor, Police Chief, City 
  Council, Civil Rights Department, Black organizations), reveals how much they 
  felt they had Blacks in their place and that they could continue the status 
  quo of discrimination with the help of the Black organizations that could "deliver" 
  Blacks to them.   </p>
<p>It is also a comment on how they ignored the warnings I provided them   
  in my book, <em>The Minneapolis Story </em>, especially Chapter 16, "The Status 
  Quo Future:   Same 'ol, same 'ol."   The preview I discussed of the 
  future in that chapter is now here.   Indeed, the chapter headings is "Unrest, 
  Disturbance:   The Status Quo Price Minneapolis is Willing to Pay"   
  to keep the status quo.   With this law suit, that status quo is finally 
  broken and smashed. </p>
<p>So I am not surprised to hear back stage reports that the Mayor and the Chief 
  and the Civil Rights Department Director are all blaming me.   That's like 
  blaming the rock for breaking the window that the kid tossed through it, or 
  like blaming the California fire destruction on fire instead on the arsonists 
  in some cases or the pollcies in most that refuse to allow the kindling to be 
  removed from its "natural" setting and thus be fuel for any fire.   </p>
<p>As the 45 page law suit points out, the city has been tossing lots of rocks, 
  and the Police Department has been letting the kindling pile up on the precinct 
  floors until this combustion finally took place, feeding on all the incidents 
  of racism and discrimination over the 20 year service life of these officers. 
</p>
<p>What goes unsaid, but needs to be highlighted, is that this is no secret to 
  Chief Dolan.   He has been on the force for 22 years.   He is part 
  and parcel of the good 'ol boys of the white officers, and his actions and this 
  suit highlight this fact. </p>
<p>If the stakes were not so high and the consequences not so troubling, it would 
  be laughable for the city, especially the chief, to claim I have some kind of 
  power to cloud peoples' minds, like The Shadow, or twist them like pretzels 
  like Plastic Man, or being stealthy like the Invisible Woman, or bust through 
  their walls like the Thing or burn down their public facades like Johnny Storm. 
    I am not the Fantastic Four.   But the Mayor, the chief, the civil 
  rights director, and the City Council are the unfabulous four when it comes 
  to failing to serve the whole community, concentrating on the white part and 
  discriminating against the Black part. </p>
<p>I'm just one guy, a community activist, focused on speaking the truth for all, 
  taking one step at a time, one word at a time, one day at a time, one column 
  at a time, laying out my case regarding what Minneapolis does to violate the 
  civil rights of its Black citizens.    So when they attribute special 
  powers to me, they think they are off the   hook.   Sorry folks.   
</p>
<p>The City has populated its pond with incident after incident of racism, discrimination, 
  and   hostility.   They then put the hooks on the line, baited their 
  own hooks with their own racist and discriminatory acts, and cast their lines, 
  only to be surprised to catch this whale of their own creation.   I'm just 
  the reporter on the fishing beat. </p>
<p>What is happening is that this law suit (which is not by me or about me) serves 
  as affirmation of what I've been saying over the years.   Minneapolis is 
  a racist city that believes it can act on that racism and discriminate against 
  Blacks and deny them equal access and equal opportunity, especially in education, 
  jobs, and housing.   </p>
<p>I wrote a book in 2002 detailing this.   Copies were given to the Mayor 
  and city Council and Strib and the University and HHH, Black organizations, 
  etc.   It was spurned by the City, the Black organizations, and the Black 
  leadership/ministerial forum, all of whom told people not to buy it and not 
  to read it.  <br>
  The NAACP expelled me for writing it (not for what I wrote but that I wrote). 
     They took no corrective action.   The pressure just continued 
  to build.   The dam had to break at some point.   Now it has.   
  So this law suit should not come as a surprise.   </p>
<p>The Minneapolis Spokesman Recorder has carried my columns where, on a weekly 
  basis since 2003, I have detailed the city's racism and discrimination, especially 
  in the areas of jobs and the treatment of Black police. So this law suit should 
  not come as a surprise. </p>
<p>As the spokesman for the Black Police Officers Association since 1996, I have 
  been able to write about this.   But the city took no corrective action. 
  The pressure just continued to build.   So this law suit should not come 
  as a surprise. </p>
<p>This web site has carried a web log, "Closing the Gaps," about the gaps in 
  Minneapolis between Blacks and whites regarding equal access and equal opportunity 
  in education, jobs, housing, public safety, environment, governance, and ethics. 
    <br>
  It has been open to all. But the city took no corrective action. The pressure 
  just continued to build.   So this law suit should not come as a surprise. 
</p>
<p>This law suit will have a major impact on city politics and race relations. 
    That too should not come as a surprise, especially if the city maintains, 
  despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that it has done no wrong 
  and need take no corrective action.   The last time they took this stance 
  it led to the feds making them engage in mediation that, given their attempts 
  to sabotage the mediation process, resulted in the PCRC.   Should they 
  continue their same 'ol same 'ol, they risk the next, predictable step, the 
  police department being put into receivership.   </p>
<p>And saying they'll be good boys in the future is not enough.   They have 
  to show it in action and by institutionalizing the needed changes. </p>
<p>As I noted at the top of this entry, Martin Luther King,   Jr., famously 
  asked that we be judged by our character, not by the color of our skin.   
  The law suit about police discrimination in the department, illustrates the 
  need for such judgment.   You see, the city is asking us to judge it on 
  the basis of its skin color, not by its character.   Why?   Because 
  it can demonstrate its whiteness but it can't demonstrate its character.   
  Why?   </p>
<p>Because the City has chosen to lie.    It won't, and therefore can't, 
  demonstrate character.   And that is one of the city's biggest character 
  flaws:   official lying by lying officials.   Lying for decades, lying 
  for years, lying for months.   And in their press conferences cited above, 
  the city officials lied again.   </p>
<p>The law suit says Blacks are discriminated against in both hiring and in treatment 
  once hired.   The City denies it.   They lie, as the figures shown 
  above demonstrate.   Because they view discriminating behavior as normal, 
  they can't see it, and instead fall back on the defense of numbers, a percentage, 
  as if because they have hired minorities (less than half of which are Black) 
  that it means they are an organization that sings Kumbaya and does trust falls. 
    </p>
<p>Why did so many press conferences abound the week of Decemer 4 th ?   
  Because this is a historic law suit, a suit against the police department that 
  has resulted in the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a city administration: 
    having the call put out for the putting of your Police Department under 
  receivership (taken over and run by the Federal Government).   Press conferences 
  were held by the PCRC, by the MPD, by the Mayor, by City Council members.   
  The law suit calls for a day of reckoning for all of the discrimination in the 
  department over the decades in general and against the five suing police officers 
  in particular.   </p>
<p>The police have been one of our four main areas of concern.  <br>
  We would hope that parallel suits could be done for education (by students and 
  their parents), jobs (5 columns on this are highlighted at the top of the page), 
  and housing (of which the Hollman taking, with NAACP collusion, remains the 
  sad model of what not to do).</p>
