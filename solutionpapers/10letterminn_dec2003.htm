  <p><strong>From Beacon on the Press</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is exciting to contemplate the upcoming 94th Annual NAACP Convention in 
  Miami, July 12-17-03. May it be all you want it to be. I am writing to all of 
  you Executive Officers, including your Chairman and your CEO/President, and 
  sending each of you a copy of the enclosed book, The Minneapolis Story, Through 
  My Eyes for you because I know that you will enjoy the book in and of itself, 
  as it is really the story of every city, and because I am hopeful that you will 
  be able to celebrate its author, another fine Black civil rights activist and 
  leader, either at Miami or afterwards. </p>
<p>The book is witness to why many in Minneapolis believe its author should be 
  positively recognized at your 94th annual meeting for his work in civil rights. 
  It would also serve as a healing moment for the NAACP, nationally and locally. 
  Ron was Chairman of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission from 1979-1983 (Vice-Chairman, 
  1967-1972); President, Chairman of the Urban League (1978-1989), and served 
  on the Minneapolis branch NAACP Executive Committee, 1999-2002, as well as other 
  positions for the branch and the Minnesota-South Dakota NAACP. He has served 
  as the spokesman for the Black Police Officer&#8217;s Association in Minneapolis since 
  1996.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of anyone more committed to following your web page statement 
  of following &#8220;the objective of insuring the political, educational, social 
  and economic equality of minority groups&#8221; than this key civil rights worker 
  and community activist of Minneapolis, Ron Edwards. Indeed, he addresses the 
  political, educational, social and economic equality of minority groups in separate 
  chapters of his book. Certainly, in terms of your NAACP web site statement, 
  Ron Edwards is one &#8220;of America&#8217;s greatest minds [to] have worked to effect 
  change.&#8221; His book, The Minneapolis Story, Through My Eyes, could just as 
  easily have been called the New York City Story or Newark Story or Detroit Story 
  or St. Louis Story or Cleveland Story or Kansas City Story or L.A. Story or 
  San Francisco Story, or Atlanta Story or Washington, D.C. Story, etc. In other 
  words, although he writes the story of Blacks in American cities today from 
  the perspective of Minneapolis, it is a perspective that fits any city. You 
  can also listen to Ron reading from the book, on 6 tracks, on the web site, 
  at <a href="https://theminneapolisstory.com" target="_blank">www.TheMinneapolisStory.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>But Ron goes further. He not only talks the walk, he walks the talk: he proposes 
  solutions to resolve the difficulties, which, again, could be used in any city 
  and would make great platforms for change for use by the NAACP across the country. 
  And certainly your description of the NAACP describes Ron, for Ron has served, 
  unpaid. He is a &#8220;tireless volunteer&#8221; who works &#8220;to meet the 
  challenges of the day, while remaining true to [the] original mission. With 
  renewed commitment, [Ron] is poised to meet the challenges of the 21st century.&#8221; 
  In a word, Ron shares the Kweisi Mfume dream to &#8220;impact society and shape 
  a more humane public policy.&#8221; And he provides the process and framework 
  for doing so. What a great ally he is for all concerned about civil and human 
  rights across the board, and who promotes, in the words of the Preamble to our 
  Constitution, &#8220;a more perfect Union,&#8230;Justice,&#8230;domestic Tranquility,&#8230;general 
  Welfare, and&#8230;the blessings of Liberty&#8221; for every citizen, regardless 
  of race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, political party, neighborhood, etc.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s story is a positive story of hope, patience and perseverance, of the 
  celebration of life in America, of an appreciation of a glass half full that 
  means a lot of work is yet to be done for the other half of the glass that is 
  still empty. He presents a vision of achievable, practical possibilities. </p>
<p>For the NAACP to recognize Ron&#8217;s book as a beacon to other cities, as an invitation 
  for them to tell the story of their cities as well, would provide a big boost 
  for the NAACP nationwide. Finally, doing so will enable the NAACP to set a positive 
  example for local NAACP branches across the country. As you know, the NAACP 
  branch in Minneapolis kicked Ron out, then banned him, and then demanded an 
  apology for what he said about the NAACP in his book (his comments are in Chapter 
  14). </p>
<p>This surprised me, given his quotes in the same chapter of Julian Bond. In 
  my naivet&eacute;, I thought the NAACP would appreciate his sense of humor and 
  use it to inspire everyone to get back on track, and follow the words of Julian 
  Bond. I didn&#8217;t expect them to take it as an attack on the local branch, especially 
  in light of the comments of others that he quotes in the same chapter. My perspective 
  was that they and Ron were standing on common ground. The local branch obviously 
  didn&#8217;t take it that way. A Black leader here in Portland sometimes refers to 
  her adult charges as &#8220;her children,&#8221; and I suspect you may sometimes 
  think the same regarding local branches, as you breath out a sigh. It causes 
  all of us to give out individual and collective sighs.</p>
<p>The local NAACP branch has veered from the NAACP. As it has moved from being 
  a &#8220;guide on the side&#8221; to wanting to be the &#8220;sage on the stage,&#8221; 
  it has lost the sense of being a leader of diversity and now wants homogenous 
  followers. Recognizing Ron at your convention would help to revitalize the local 
  branch and local branches everywhere as well as heal the unnecessary misunderstandings. 
  The hard data is inescapable. The many stories in the Minneapolis Black newspaper 
  Spokesman-Recorder and pictures detailing the local branch&#8217;s secret meetings 
  is one of the reasons why (1) it has little credibility, especially among the 
  young, and thus (2) the branch has only 450 members out of over 100,000 Blacks 
  in Minneapolis, who too often follow the local White leadership rather than 
  the NAACP, which resulted in (3) its last election dynamics to prevent Ron from 
  being elected, which included brining in Whites to vote against him as well 
  as pull &#8220;a Florida&#8221; on Ron&#8217;s Black supporters by disqualifying them. 
  As a result, 85% of those voting for the election&#8217;s winner were White. The good 
  news is that civil rights leaders like Ron Edwards can still work with you to 
  help bring credibility back.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s book demonstrates that he eloquently stands for all that the NAACP stands 
  for: a diverse economy of living-wage jobs that includes locally based independent 
  businesses owned by both Blacks and Whites, all living in decent housing while 
  their kids get a decent education. Ron&#8217;s Interlude 8, &#8220;Torn from the Land,&#8221; 
  shows how the land and wealth of Blacks were taken in this country, whether 
  by de jure or de facto Jim Crow laws, as well as by such extra-legal means as 
  the burning to the ground of whole towns, as in Greenwood, Oklahoma (see Interlude 
  13 on the Tulsa Race Riots), and Rosewood, Florida (see Interlude 8). Blacks 
  have been offered prejudice and discrimination, segregation and bias, while 
  being denied equal access and denied equal opportunity, in order to purposefully 
  leave Blacks behind. Ron has an analysis and solution for this.</p>
<p>To briefly review Ron&#8217;s book: Ron writes in a compelling way about the PAST 
  (see his almost love sonnet to Minneapolis in Chapter 15, the 7 paragraphs beginning 
  on p. 262 with &#8220;Society needs visionaries.&#8221; He also writes about the 
  identifying characteristics of Minneapolis, positive and negative, that have 
  led us to where Minneapolis is today (Chapter 6), and he sets out his philosophy 
  (Chapter 4) as he singles out justice and fairness as it relates to equal access 
  and opportunity (Chapter 5). He unveils the truth about the PRESENT in his chapters 
  on the courts (Chapter 3), education (Chapter 7), housing (Chapter 8), jobs 
  (Chapter 9), the university (Chapter 10), city government (Chapter 11), redistricting 
  (Chapters 12-13), the local branches of the NAACP and the Urban League (Chapter 
  14), the set up to kick the Vikings out of town (Chapter 15), and about community-police 
  relations and mediation (Chapter 16). And now the table turns as Ron becomes 
  the visionary writing about the FUTURE in a most positive and challenging way 
  as he lays out the common ground all Minneapolis citizens and Minnesotans can 
  agree to, Black and White, male and female, with his common YESes and common 
  NOs, and other suggestions for taking today into tomorrow (see Chapter 5, Interlude 
  16, Chapter 17, and the Conclusion), including suggesting the establishment 
  of a Sullivan Principles for Minneapolis. </p>
<p>The book uses the term &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;racist.&#8221; These terms 
  are not used to emotionally obscure fuzzy thinking about the causes of poverty, 
  inequality, different levels of school achievement, etc., about which there 
  is much debate (but, as Ron says Nellie Stone Johnson always used to tell him, &#8220;No education, no housing, no hope&#8221;). Ron uses the terms to build 
  on the Minneapolis Star Tribune&#8217;s 1991 series on racism in Minnesota (&#8221;Issues 
  of Race&#8221;) as he notes in Interlude 2. The terms refer to the prejudice, 
  discrimination, segregation, bigotry, and bias used to deny equal access and 
  equal opportunity, something Whites did not see as an issue but non-Whites did. 
  However, Ron is not unmindful of the progress that has been made, as he demonstrates 
  in Interludes, 5 and 7, which he calls &#8220;The Good News On Race, Parts I 
  and II.&#8221; He also recognizes that any glass that is half full is also half 
  empty, as in Interlude 10, which discusses the racism in Minneapolis as reported 
  in a 1991 cover story of the Mpls.St.Paul Magazine. Ron seeks equal access and 
  opportunity for all, whether inner city or in any ring of the suburbs or rural.</p>
<p>As noted above, Ron recognizes that &#8220;Society needs visionaries,&#8221; 
  be they organizations like the NAACP and the Urban League or individuals such 
  as those he writes about in his book: George Washington Carver, W.E.B. DuBois, 
  Martin Luther King, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, George Washington, Abraham 
  Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Nelly Stone Johnson, A. Philip Randolph, Adam Clayton 
  Powell, and others. </p>
<p>Ron understands the Minneapolis Story, its successes and pride as well as its 
  historic wrongs perpetrated against minorities in general and Blacks in particular 
  that need to be redressed and fixed. The reason I call recognizing Ron for his 
  contributions would be a healing moment is because he recognizes that it takes 
  two to tango, that the problems have been because of both White and Black organizations. 
  Ron straddles both the Black and White communities, the city and the suburbs. 
  Ron gives a fair hearing to the issues of importance to both the minority and 
  majority communities in such a way that they can both deal with the issues together 
  rather than make them political party issues. The NAACP can help lead the way, 
  and under that leadership, working together, we can make democracy work.</p>
<p>Ron has long enjoyed and been concerned about the NAACP, just as other reasonable 
  men have their concerns about their organizations, such as the concerns of Julian 
  Bond that Ron quotes in Chapter 14. Ron raises the perennial question of how 
  can Black organizations in Minneapolis expect to truly serve Blacks and ALL 
  of Minneapolis if they treat the organizations as private entities for the benefit 
  of a few. </p>
<p>This is a wonderful time of opportunity for organizations like the NAACP to 
  rise to the challenge of getting people to keep their collective eye on the 
  prize. And who better than Ron to help bridge the gap between the older leaders 
  and the young leaders today? The up and coming young leaders are being understandably 
  very vocal about how they feel frozen out by the older ones (many of who have 
  forgotten that they were once young and also rebelled against their elders and 
  didn&#8217;t ask their permission, which is the way of the world, generation to generation) 
  and yet now tell the new younger generation they have to ask their elders for 
  permission. Can you imagine what energy and progress could be made if they could 
  all coalesce into a moving coalition to address the common problems together, 
  using the common ground solution process outlined in Ron&#8217;s book?</p>
<p>You can continue to follow Ron&#8217;s thoughts on his weekly column and his daily 
  web log, both of which appear on his web page, www.TheMinneapolisStory.com.</p>
<p>Recognizing and honoring the contributions of Ron would help all of this take 
  a giant step forward. If you have any further questions or wish to use the book 
  for discussion groups or other uses, or if Beacon on the Hill can help in any 
  other way, please let me know. By the way, as your address listed on the NAACP 
  web page has not been updated, I&#8217;m sending this to the NAACP office. </p>
